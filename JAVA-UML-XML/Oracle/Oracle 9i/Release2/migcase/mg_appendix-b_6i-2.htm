<H1><A NAME="Repository%20Terminology%20quick%20ref"></A>Repository Terminology quick reference information</H1>
<H2>Application (Container)&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A type of Container that groups Structured Elements with a logical affinity to each other. This affinity may
be data related (i.e. all data elements for &lt;App System Cluster&gt;) or function related.&nbsp; An Application
may container Folders to hold related File Elements and Documents (i.e. ins and ddl).</P>
<H2>Application Item&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A type of Configuration Item that is the direct source for an application executable element (i.e. Module Definition,
Report Source File).&nbsp; These generate out as Developer, PL/SQL, etc. source or are extracted “as is”.</P>
<H2>Application System Cluster</H2>
<P>A group of application systems that are strongly interrelated. For example a set of entities and tables from
application system CORE is referenced by the application systems SALES and STOCK. You would typically group these
application systems in a single workarea.</P>
<H2>Base line configuration or release</H2>
<P>A base line configuration - or base line release - represents a full set of object definitions for a specific
system. For example base line configuration &lt;App System&gt; 3 represents release 3&nbsp; of system &lt;App System&gt;
and contains all elements within &lt;App System&gt; that should be deployed for release 3.</P>
<H2>Branch</H2>
<P>Branches are sequences of object versions that have their starting point at a particular version in an existing
branch, but evolve independently. All the versions together create a version tree. A version tree always has a
MAIN branch, and may also have sub-branches. Branching enables you to develop multiple versions of a product simultaneously
(parallel development) using the same set of source files.</P>
<P>When you check in an object for the first time, it is always added to the default MAIN branch. If the repository
policy specifies an alternative branch to check in to for the first time, two versions are created, one on MAIN
and the other on the specified alternative branch.</P>
<H2>Check-in</H2>
<P>The check-in option versions an uploaded file/folder or a saved structured element. For example, the file or
folder is already stored in the repository and in addition it will be enhanced with version information and you
will be able to view the file/folder/structured element in another workarea. Note that another version of an element
can only be created via a check-in operation.</P>
<H2>Check-out</H2>
<P>Repository elements can only be manipulated when they are checked-out (or un-versioned). You therefore first
have to check-out a checked-in element before you can apply changes. The check-out action starts with the creation
of a duplicate of the element. This allows you to perform an undo check-out operation. As a result you will fall
back on the original, checked-in element version.</P>
<H2>Configuration</H2>
<P>A configuration is another means to isolate - only - one version of one or more repository elements. The content
of a configuration is fully static - in contrast to workareas. Like any other element you can version configuration.
This version capability of configurations can be used to associate configurations with workarea or to put it differently
to base a workarea on one or more configurations. Another application&nbsp; of the configuration version capability
is the storage of an original element set in the “first” version of the configuration. Within the&nbsp; next version
all corresponding derived elements (ddl files) are stored.</P>
<H2>Configuration Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<P>The product of a task, or a deliverable for the project, which is placed under Configuration Management.</P>
<H2>Container</H2>
<P>A grouping of items for the purpose of usage, access, or extraction.&nbsp; Within the Oracle Repository containers
can be Applications (e.g. DMO, Headstart) or Folders (e.g. ins, ddl).&nbsp; Containers should not be confused with
Workareas - see below. Workareas are a mean of presenting containers and their contents.</P>
<H2>Data Content Item</H2>
<P>A type of Configuration Item that is the direct source for the initiation of a database schema element (i.e.
seed data script).&nbsp; These are extracted “as is” for use.</P>
<H2>Data Management Item&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A type of Configuration Item that is the direct source for the restructuring, conversion, or initiation of a
database schema element (i.e. restructure table script).&nbsp; These are extracted “as is” for use.</P>
<H2>Data Structure Item&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A type of Configuration Item that is the direct source for a database schema element or a database schema logic
element (i.e. Table or View Definition).&nbsp; These generate out as DDL scripts.</P>
<H2>Database Schema</H2>
<P>A database schema is a user in the database. Each database element like a table or view (expect a role) is owned
by a database schema.</P>
<H2>Database Synchronization</H2>
<P>The Database synchronization term refers to state of database definitions in the repository versus its - mapped-
database objects in&nbsp; the database within a database schema&nbsp; There can be a mismatch between these two,&nbsp;
since there are (within the context of a workarea) two database representations - one in the repository and one
in the database. The database synchronization status can be checked with the CheckRelease Form - see CheckRelease
QRC.</P>
<H2>Database User</H2>
<P>See database schema. Note that each database user can access its own database objects - obviously. In addition
a database user can access database elements of other users -&nbsp; or schema’s - via a mechanism of grants and
synonyms.</P>
<H2>Document (Item)</H2>
<P>Any type of Configuration Item which is part of the supporting description an application system’s architecture,
environment, usage, or its general definition.</P>
<H2>Download</H2>
<P>The download option allows you to publish files and/or folders from the repository to a specific folder path
on the operating system - either based on the default folder mapping or session specific value. The download will
prompt you if the file already exist on the file system.</P>
<H2>Edit Workarea Rule Specification</H2>
<P>The content of a workarea is primarily determined by workarea rules -see above. You need a specific workarea
access right (Update Spec) to change the workarea rules for a workarea. This Update Spec policy is only given to
a PCM. This Update Spec right must be distributed in combination with the Refresh or Compile right - see below.</P>
<H2>Element&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<P>Any type of Configuration Item (see above), intermediate item (not under configuration control), executable
item (for deployment), or other component which is associated with the development and deployment of the application
system that is being constructed or maintained. An&nbsp; element can either be structured or unstructured (file).</P>
<H2>Environment</H2>
<P>A specific set of elements drawn from across each of the technology layers.&nbsp; An environment is identified
as being for a particular promotion state or purpose, such as application development or application deployment.&nbsp;
An environment will include a specific Baseline Configuration, a directory structure containing source and executable
programs, a specific database schema containing data structures and data content, and an accessible toolset.</P>
<H2>File Element&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A type of Application Element which may or may not have been originally sourced from Designer, but whose current
source is the file system representation.&nbsp; (i.e. Report with post-generation changes, data conversion scripts
written by hand)</P>
<H2>File Synchronization</H2>
<P>The File synchronization term&nbsp; (not to confuse with the synchronization option&nbsp; - see above) refers
to state of files in the repository versus its - mapped - files on the file system. There can be a mismatch between
these two, since there are (within the context of a workarea) two file representations - one in the repository
and one on the file&nbsp; system. The file synchronization status can be checked with the CheckRelease Form - see
CheckRelease QRC.</P>
<H2>Folder (Container)</H2>
<P>A type of Container that groups File Elements with a logical affinity to each other.&nbsp; This may related
by usage, project phase focus, or other criteria.&nbsp; Top level Folders are usually created as children of Applications
and may contain other Folders in turn.<BR>
A standard set of Folders has been identified for general use in all Applications (i.e. ins and ddl).</P>
<H2>Folder Mapping</H2>
<P>Folders - containers for files - in the repository can be mapped against directories on the file system via
the folder mapping option - available for root containers only. This mapping - stored locally in the registry -
is reused while downloading and uploading files, see below.</P>
<H2>Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<P>See Configuration Item.</P>
<H2>Item Type</H2>
<P>The classification of an Item based on its definition, characteristics, or use (see below).</P>
<H2>(CM) Repository&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A storage system which contains a copy of all the items under Configuration Management control, and also contains
the information that relates those items to each other and to project deliverables.&nbsp; This facility is provided
by the Oracle Repository, which is implemented as a specific database schema, that underlies the Oracle Designer
toolset. The CM repository contains for example all &lt;App System&gt; entities, tables, views and files and subsequent
versions.</P>
<H2>Root Container</H2>
<P>A root container (application system or folder) is the starting point of a container structure like a&nbsp;
root directory on the file system.</P>
<H2>Partial configuration</H2>
<P>A partial configuration contains only a limited set of object definitions for a specific release. A partial
configuration can be&nbsp; associated with a single registered enhancement request (“Change Request”) or with a
bundle of registered enhancement requests. For example partial configuration &lt;App System&gt;_20013011 represents
enhancement request &lt;App System&gt;_20013011 for system &lt;App System&gt; and contains only objects that are
associated with this enhancement request.</P>
<H2>Refresh a Workarea</H2>
<P>The refresh or compile option of a workarea - another specific wokarea accces right- reevaluates the content
of a workarea based upon the workarea rules - without changing the workarea rules itself. The end-result (pointers)
is stores in the workarea table.</P>
<H2>Re-query a workarea</H2>
<P>The re-query does not reevaluate the workarea rules, but takes the persistent workarea table content as a given
and re-queries all primary and secondary elements, associations and properties.</P>
<H2>Sandbox Workarea</H2>
<P>A sandbox - or playground - workarea can be used for the preparation of releases or to experiment with workarea
rules. The usage of a separate workarea during the preparation of a release circumvents the interference with ongoing
development and testing activities.</P>
<H2>Specific Workarea Operations</H2>
<P>The following operations can be executed against a workarea:</P>

<UL Type="DISC" STYLE="List-Style-Type : Disc">
	<LI>Change the workarea rules or edit workarea rule specification
	<LI>Refresh a workarea
	<LI>Re-query a workarea
</UL>

<H2>Structured Element&nbsp;&nbsp;</H2>
<P>A type of Application Element which is defined wholly within the Designer toolset and is then generated out
from there for use in the application system (i.e. Entity, Table Definitions, View Definitions)</P>
<H2>Synchronization</H2>
<P>The synchronization option (files only) compares the repository content with the underlying file system - for
a specific directory tree. Subsequently it will suggest uploads and download for file mismatches. This option will
be however rarely used since a files are downloaded or uploaded on a individual basis during check-in and check-out
procedures - see&nbsp; Check-in and Check-out QRC.</P>
<H2>Target or destination file system</H2>
<P>The target or destination file system is the environment on the file system level that will receive the files
for a specific system (DMO) captured in a specific release.</P>
<H2>Target or destination database schema</H2>
<P>The target or destination database schema is the schema in the database - in the specific target database instance
- that captures the database objects of one or more systems (e.g. &lt;App System&gt;, OHL) of a specific release
(or configuration).</P>
<H2>Target or destination workarea</H2>
<P>The target or destination workarea is the environment in the repository that will receive the release - captured
in a configuration. The target or destination workarea - given the (D)TAP model -could be either Test (e.g. &lt;App
System&gt;_TST_REL&lt;release nr&gt;), Acceptance test (e.g. &lt;App System&gt;_ACC) or Production workarea (&lt;App
System&gt;_PRD).</P>
<H2>Tip Version</H2>
<P>The latest object version of a branch</P>
<H2>Upload</H2>
<P>The upload option allows you to store files and/or folders in the repository from a specific file system path
- either based on the default folder mapping or session specific value. Note that an upload does not check-in the
element, i.e., no version properties are added and you cannot view a stored file/folder in another workarea.</P>
<H2>Verification of the Synchronization between the Repository versus File and Database</H2>
<P>The CheckRelease Form reports about the synchronization - status - of repository elements versus its file representatives
on the file system and its database representatives in the database - see also CheckRelease QRC.</P>
<H2>Version</H2>
<P>The rendering of an item which incorporates all of its revised content starting from a given point (i.e. from
a previous version).</P>
<H2>Workarea</H2>
<P>A workarea serves as an access vehicle or environment to the repository content. Within a workarea you can see
(and manipulate with appropriate access rights) - only - one version of one or more objects - grouped in a container
structure. <BR>
It therefore provides a version resolved access mechanism to the repository elements. A workarea only contains
pointers to the full definition of&nbsp; the element - it does not capture the full element definition.</P>
<P>The content of a workarea can change over time - for example via check-in and check-out actions. I.e. a workarea
content is dynamic. <BR>
Almost all Repository and Designer tools - except the RON - only allows you to access the repository elements in
the context of a workarea, i.e., you cannot access the DE in the context of a configuration.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Note that there is - luckily -&nbsp; no need to version a workarea. Therefore you cannot version&nbsp; a workarea.</P>
<H2>Workarea rules</H2>
<P>The content of a workarea is primarily determined by workarea rules. A workarea can contain multiple workarea
rules (e.g. LATEST(MAIN), INCLUDE_FOLDER(&lt;App System&gt;)) that are evaluated one by one (from top to bottom).
The evaluation result - pointers to the full element definition - is subsequently stored in a persistent way (in&nbsp;
a workarea table).</P>
<H1><A NAME="Designer/Repository%20Tools%20quick%20"></A>Designer/Repository Tools quick reference information</H1>
<H2>Repository Object Navigator (RON)</H2>
<P>The RON or Repository Object Navigator provides a tree-navigational interface to the repository elements (structured
elements and files). Subsequently the RON hosts all configuration management functionality like the manipulation
of workareas,&nbsp; configurations and branches, file manipulation, and merge utilities.</P>
<H2>Design Editor (DE)</H2>
<P>The DE of Design Editor also provides a tree-navigational interface and a graphical interface to the structured
design repository elements like tables, views and sequences. In addition it hosts the DDL generators. Note that
these generators are no longer available in the RON.</P>
<H2>Version History Viewer (VHV)</H2>
<P>The Version History Viewer displays a graphical interface of all versions of a specific element. You can launch
the VHV from the RON or DE.</P>
<H2>Version Event Viewer (VEV)</H2>
<P>The Version Event Viewer displays a character based interface of all versions history information (e.g. check-in/check-out
notes, the owner of the changes, when changes took place) of a specific element. You can launch the VEV from the
RON or DE.</P>
<H2>Element Compare Tool</H2>
<P>The element compare tool displays a detailed overview of the differences between two element versions. You can
launch the element compare tool either from the RON or DE.</P>
<H2>Element set compare tool</H2>
<P>The element set compare tool displays an overview of the element set differences - differences in&nbsp; versions
numbers. For example the differences in element set memberships of two workareas or configurations.</P>
<P>You can launch the element set compare tool only from the RON.</P>
<H2>Element merge tool</H2>
<P>The element nerge tool merge differences between two object versions on different branches on a conflict by
conflict basis. For example you can merge object version 1.2.1.1 into MAIN branch label 1.4 resulting in version
1.5.<BR>
You can launch the merge tool from the VHV.</P>
<H2>Merge Wizard</H2>
<P>The merge wizard allows you to perform a merge for a set of elements.</P>
<P>For example you can merge all elements checked-in on a specific branch (e.g. &lt;App System&gt;_REL1) into the
corresponding elements in the workarea that captures the MAIN branch (e.g. &lt;App System Cluster&gt;_DEV)<BR>
You can launch the merge wizard from the RON.</P>
<H1><A NAME="Naming%20Standards%20quick%20reference"></A>Naming Standards quick reference information</H1>
<H2>Release nr [x]</H2>
<P>The format of a&nbsp; release nr is indicated with x where x the major component represents. <BR>
A release can contain all objects of an application system&nbsp; (baseline release) or it could contain only the
changed and added objects introduced in a specific release (increment).</P>
<P>E.g. 10. <BR>
Note that releases are implemented by configurations and that you could have multiple versions of configurations
- see also below.</P>
<H2>Version nr [1.y]</H2>
<P>The format of the version number of a single object is indicated with 1.y where y represents any major or minor
change.</P>
<P>e.g. 1.1</P>
<H2>Branch Version nr [1.y.1.z]</H2>
<P>The format of a branch version number of a single object is indicated with 1.y.1.z where ‘y’ and ‘z’&nbsp; represents
any major or minor change e.g. 1.1.1.1</P>
<H2>&lt;App System Cluster&gt;_DEV workarea</H2>

<OL>
	<LI>Always fill-in the check-out and check-in text box in English
	<LI>Provide references - when applicable - to the corresponding “Change Request” numbers.
	<LI>Reuse the check-out text while checking-in and subsequently update the check-in text with actual revision information
	<LI><B>Never </B>perform an undo check-out against containers (application systems or folders) because you are
	not in control of the check-out context - other developers may have added or removed elements.
	<LI>The context of a check-in should be equal to the change request context. I.e. do not leave the element in a
	checked-out status after you have finished your “Change Request” changes for a specific element
	<LI>Always add the revision keyword string to the structured design element of file - see section Revision keyword
	guidelines
	<LI>Only check-in an element if the element is complete, ie., a table is complete if it contains all secondary

<H2>Revision keyword guidelines</H2>
<P>The repository supports the following revision&nbsp; keywords:</P>

	<LI>$Au’||’thor::xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx$
	<LI>$Da’||’te::xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx$
	<LI>$Wo’||’rkfile::xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx$
</UL>

<P>Note that you should not use the string ‘||’ on the specific location.. This string is added here to circumvent
the expansion when this specific QRC document is checked-in in the repository.</P>
<P>You should always add the “revision” keyword string - on a specific location/property - into new design elements
and files. Use the following overview for the specific location:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Table - comment property
	<LI>View - comment property
	<LI>File - in the header, prefixed with a comment tokens when used in a SQL script or Shell script
</UL>

<P>Note that you can copy/paste an existing revision keyword string for the exact syntax from existing tables/views/files
- the version string is automatically updated after the check-in operation.</P>
<H2>Removal Check-list of folders, structured elements or files</H2>

	<LI>Perform a merge to the MAIN branch each time you are planning to cut a new release from MAIN
	<LI>Find the candidate merge elements - for a specific user - on a specific branch via the ODWA6<I>i</I> search
	utility by providing a value for the following fields - on the several search ODWA6<I>i</I> TABS for example:

	<P>Branch Label : [Version]</P>
	<P>Checked-in By: [Version]</P>
	<P>Check State:&nbsp; “Checked-in” [Version].</P>
	<P>Note that you may find too many merge candidates, since you do not need to merge if the tip of the branch is
	already merged into the MAIN branch. The latter can be visualized via the ODWA6<I>i</I> Version History Viewer.
	You could also try to narrow down the search result by translating the “merge of the tip version into the MAIN
	branch” condition into an “additional where clause” field on the [Advanced] search TAB.</P>

	color and start a request for a checked-in status - see section Request Check-list for a checked-in status of a
	checked-out element to enforce a check-in status.
	<LI>Mark within the VHV the checked-out version, move your cursor to the source object version and launch the option
	“merge to mark”. The Merge dialogue or wizard tries to suggest a default change on a specific branch for every
	conflict. This default is indicated with an enabling of a specific version. Subsequently you can perform an automatic
	merge if every conflict (or difference) is associated with a default. Therefore you may have to&nbsp; manual interfere
	whenever the wizard cannot make a specific choice for a each difference.
	<LI>Save the merge operation - the&nbsp; merge itself does not automatically creates a new version
	<LI>Verify the merge result with a compare of the source object version with the target (merged) object version
	and make additional changes if necessary
	<LI>Check-in the target (merged) object version
	<LI>Consider a merge to other branches of the object
