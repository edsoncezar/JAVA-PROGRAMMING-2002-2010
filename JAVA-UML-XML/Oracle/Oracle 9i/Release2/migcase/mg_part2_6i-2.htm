<H1><A NAME="Chapter%201%20Introduction"></A>Chapter 1 Introduction</H1>
<P>This second part provides different scenarios and related migration tools for the migration of structured data
from previous Oracle Designer releases and the migration of files either from a source control system (e.g. PVCS/VM,
ClearCase) or the migration of files/folders directly from the file system. The different migration scenarios share
the following common structure:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Preparation
	<LI>Migration of structured data
	<LI>Migration of files
	<LI>Reorganization steps
	<LI>Migration of users and access privileges
	<LI>Synchronizing the file system and database
</OL>

<P>The <I>preparation </I>step basically involves the clean-up of your &quot;original&quot; elements and a fresh
Oracle Designer 6i installation. Preparation should be followed by <I>migrating your structured elements </I>via
the migration wizard. You can then easily enter the versioned world by just checking-in structured elements. By
organizing the <I>files migration </I>after the migration of structured elements you are able to integrate your
files with the structured elements - both type of elements will share the same root-container. The migration of
both object types should be succeeded by <I>reorganization </I>steps that involve a simple implementation of a
promotion model via a combination of workareas and configurations. The reorganized repository should then be made
accessible to subordinate users. Guidelines were given for creating <I>subordinate users </I>and the distribution
of the appropriate access rights on the previously mentioned objects. Finally a significant part of your repository
content will ultimately populate your databases and file systems. You can implement the <I>file system synchronization</I>
within each workarea via the folder mapping option and the <I>database synchronization</I> within each workarea
via the DDL generator.</P>
<P>This second part is concluded with an example of a typical migration plan.</P>
<H1><A NAME="Chapter%202%20Prerequisites%20and%20inst"></A>Chapter 2 Prerequisites and installation notes</H1>
<P>The migration of structured data and files must be preceded with an installation of Oracle Designer 6i on the
client side and a fresh repository installation on the server side in an <A NAME="2-1"></A>Oracle8<I>i</I> and
Oracle9i database instance. Consult the Oracle Designer 6i Installation Guide for the installation steps on client
and server side. The Oracle Designer 6i Installation Guide contains recommendations for hardware on the client
and server sides.</P>

<P>This chapter contains guidelines for verifying the client and server side installations and how to prepare a
fresh Oracle Designer 6i installation<I> </I>for<I> </I>migration.</P>
<P>Consult Chapter 3 in Part 1 for guidelines about entering or staying away from the versioned world. If you want
to enter the versioned world you can enable element level versioning via the &quot;Enable Version Support&quot;
option in the Repository Administration Utility directly after the fresh repository installation. Note that you
cannot disable the versioning support option once you have enabled versioning, other than by creating a fresh Oracle
Designer 6i repository.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Verify%20the%20client%20side%20and%20serve"></A>Verify the client side and server side installation</H2>
<P>The verification of a fresh Oracle Designer 6i installation involves both the client side and server side.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Verification%20of%20the%20client%20side"></A>Verification of the client side</H3>
<P>Use the Oracle Installer - custom option - to confront the client side installation of Oracle Designer 6i repository
and Oracle Designer 6i tools. The left hand side represents the required versions and the left hand side the installed
versions.</P>
<P>Through the Oracle Installer you could check the following entries:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i Product
	<LI>Oracle Designer Tools
	<LI>Oracle Repository tools and API
	<LI>Oracle Modeling and Repository Online Documentation
	<LI>Oracle Modeling and Repository Online Help Product
</UL>

<P>Likewise you should check the import/export tools via the Oracle Universal Installer. Oracle Designer 6i is
certified against an Oracle 8.1.7 database or higher. You need the following specific Oracle 8.1.7 entries:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i Import and Export Tools
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Verification%20of%20the%20server%20side"></A>Verification of the server side</H3>
<P>There are two options available to verify the success of the Oracle Designer 6i repository installation:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Verification of the installation log files
	<LI>The &quot;View objects&quot; option in the Oracle Designer 6i RAU
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Verification%20of%20the%20installation"></A>Verification of the installation log files</H4>
<P>Verify the content of a fresh Oracle Designer 6i installation log file, written to the ORACLE_HOME\repadm61\logs
directory after the installation.</P>
<H4><A NAME="%22View%20options%22%20in%20the%20RAU"></A>&quot;View options&quot; in the RAU</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image004.jpg" WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="View options" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029"></P>
<P>While connected as the Oracle Designer 6i repository owner, open the Oracle Designer 6i Repository Administration
Utility and launch the View Objects option to verify the server side installation. Sort the overview on the status
property. A successful Oracle Designer 6i installation may not display the following values for the status property
of all objects:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Disabled
	<LI>Missing
	<LI>Invalid
</UL>

<P>Obviously you could directly check if any of database objects of the Oracle Designer 6i repository owner is
&quot;invalid&quot; via the status property of the view &quot;user_objects&quot;.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Prepare%20the%20Oracle9i%20Designer%20re"></A>Prepare the Oracle Designer 6i repository for migration</H2>
<P>You can &quot;run&quot; the Oracle Designer 6i repository either in a 'non-versioned' mode or version enabled.
Multiple scenarios and criteria for versioning versus non-versioning are described in Chapter 3 of Part I: Version
enabling versus non-versioning.</P>
<P><I>Skip the following&nbsp;activity if you do not want to enter the versioned world.</I></P>
<P>You can enable versioning via the Oracle Designer 6i Repository Administration Utility (connected as the Oracle
Designer 6i repository owner). Subsequently enable the versioning option from the options menu if you would like
to enter the versioned world.</P>
<P>Note that you cannot disable the version option once you have enabled versioning, other than by re-creating
a fresh Oracle Designer 6i repository.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Public%20or%20private%20synonyms"></A>Public or private synonyms</H2>
<P>You can &quot;run&quot; the Oracle Designer 6i repository either with public or with private synonyms. The enabling
or disabling of private synonyms is available at the Repository Administration Utility, as depicted below.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image006.jpg" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="293" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="The enabling or disabling of private synonyms is available at the Repository Administration Utility"
BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"></P>
<P>The use of public synonyms is more productive - no more reconciles per user- and will occupy less space in the
system tablespace. You do not need to create more than 1500 private synonyms per user. Note however that the use
of public synonyms allows you to create only one Oracle Designer 6i repository instance per database instance.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Reevaluate%20the%20file%20registry%20set"></A>Reevaluate the file registry settings</H2>
<P><I>Skip this section if you are not planning to load files in the repository.</I></P>
<P>Files in the repository can be stored as:</P>
<P>CLOB - Character Large Objects - Text file</P>
<P>BLOB - Binary Large Objects - Binary file</P>
<P>BLOB - Compressed</P>
<P>BLOB - Uncompressed</P>
<P>A file will be stored as one of the above methods based on its extension. These extensions and the subsequent
storage method are stored persistently in a repository table - i$sdd_file_registry - that can be manuplated via
the utility menu option: Edit file registry. Through this menu option new file extensions can be added and/or existing
entries can be altered as illustrated below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image008.jpg" WIDTH="558" HEIGHT="358" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Edit file registry" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030"></P>
<P>You should reevalute these file registry settings before the bulk loading of files from your third party source
control tool or file system to enforce a cost effective and efficient storage of files. You cannot alter the storage
method for a specific file and its subsequent versions once the file is uploaded in the repository. Any changes
will only have an effect on&nbsp; new files.</P>
<H1><A NAME="Chapter%203%20Migrate%20structured%20dat"></A>Chapter 3 Migrate structured data</H1>
<P>The fresh Oracle Designer 6i installation should be followed by a migration of your structured elements. The
following subjects for the migration of structured data are discussed:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>An overview of the example of Headstart structured data
	<LI>An overview of different migration strategies for structured data
	<LI>Preparation steps
	<LI>Other hints and tips based on migration best practices of structured data
	<LI>Migration to an Oracle Designer 6i repository (if applicable)
	<LI>Migration steps starting from an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository
	<LI>Post migration steps for structured data
	<LI>Verification of the migrated structured data
</UL>

<P><I>A great part of the activities of migrating structured data is also applicable if you do not want to enter
the versioned world</I>. <I>Any sections that are not applicable in a non-versioned repository will be announced
in italic.</I></P>
<H2><A NAME="Example%20of%20Headstart%20structured%20"></A>Example of Headstart structured data</H2>
<P>The different migration scenerarios will be clarified using an abstract of 'Headstart 5.0.5' structured components
and files. It is assumed that the structured Headstart 5.0.5 components are captured in two (Oracle Designer 6.0)
application systems: HSD and QMS respectively, as illustrated below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image010.jpg" WIDTH="642" HEIGHT="402" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Repository Object Navigator" BORDER="0"
v:shapes="_x0000_i1031"></P>
<H2><A NAME="Migration%20strategies%20for%20structu"></A>Migration strategies for structured data</H2>
<P>There are two strategies for migrating the repository content to Oracle Designer 6i:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Migrate an entire repository content in a single operation
	<LI>Migrate a sub-selection of application systems within a specific Oracle Designer 6.0 repository
</UL>

<P>The first strategy loads and migrates all application systems into a fresh Oracle Designer 6i repository.</P>
<P>The second strategy allows you to load and migrate one or more interrelated application systems. Non-selected
interrelated application systems will stay behind in an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository. These application systems
are candidates for migration at a later time.</P>
<P>Note that the Oracle Designer 6i migration method has changed significantly. An Oracle Designer 6.0 repository
will not be upgraded to an Oracle Designer 6i repository during the migration.</P>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i repository content (or part of it) will be copied into a freshly installed (or already
populated) Oracle Designer 6i repository. Note also that the migration is only supported starting from an Oracle
Designer 6.0 or Oracle Designer 2.1.2 repository - although it is highly recommended to update your Oracle Designer
2.1.2 to the latest patch level (patch 7of an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository) before launching the migration wizard.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Migrate%20an%20entire%20repository%20con"></A>Migrate an entire repository content</H3>
<P>There are several migration scenarios available to bring your structured objects forward to Oracle Designer
6i. This section will discuss a 'Big Bang' migration or the migration of an entire repository.</P>
<P>The 'Big Bang' migration approach is applicable in the following circumstances:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>the structured elements in the application systems are closely interrelated. You cannot isolate a subset of
	application systems because of its (many) interdependencies (also known as shares). In addition there are strong
	relationships between the files captured in the third party source control tool and the structured data in Oracle
	Designer.
	<LI>the redesign activities - directly started after the migration - are applicable to all application systems
	simultaneously.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Migrate%20a%20sub-selection%20of%20appli"></A>Migrate a sub-selection of application systems</H3>
<P>You may want to adopt a staged migration scenario in the following circumstances:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The Oracle Designer 6i migration concerns a pilot or a test migration
	<LI>It may not be necessary to migrate all your application systems and all files in case of a pilot or an evaluation
	of your migration scenario.
	<LI>A coherent set of application systems will be migrated and subsequently redesigned in the Oracle Designer 6i
	environment. At the same time other application systems within previous Oracle Designer repositories will or must
	stay behind.
</UL>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>This migration approach may not need to be complex if you choose mutual independent sets of application systems
	for each migration. You can easily add new sets of application systems to your Oracle Designer 6i repository as
	long as they are mutually exclusive. However if there is any overlap between your application systems your migration
	scenario will look like the following option. You should try to avoid staged migration of highly interdependent
	application systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<UL>
	<LI>Support and therefore changes are needed on the &quot;original&quot; environment during the migration period
	of the structured elements and files. These interim changes must also be brought forward to Oracle Designer 6i.
	<P>This situation requires a second migration cycle - though on a smaller scale - specifically if you have to migrate
	a substantial number of applications. In this second migration cycle you have bring forward both changed structured
	elements and changed files from your &quot;original&quot; repositories to Oracle Designer 6i<I>.</I> The migration
	for both types will be based upon an isolation of the changes in the &quot;original&quot; repositories and an isolation
	of the corresponding elements in Oracle Designer 6i<I>.</I>
</UL>

<P>The necessary migration steps for the staged approach will be discussed later in this chapter. See &quot;Post
migration steps for structured elements within a staged migration approach&quot;.</P>
<P>Note that you could adopt the so called “stepwise migration method” to migrate interdependent application systems
in several steps while reusing already migrated application systems. This stepwise migration method is available
as an add-on (additional software components) via the supplement option. For more information about the&nbsp; supplement
option, see <A HREF="http://www.otn.oracle.com" target="_blank">www.otn.oracle.com</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Preparing%20(cleaning%20up)%20your%20'ol"></A>Preparing (cleaning up) your 'old' repository content</H2>
<P>A clean-up of your old Oracle Designer repositories should precede the actual migration. It will not only save
time during the migration but it will also limit future repository maintenance effort.</P>
<P>The following clean-up checklist is applicable to structured data:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Remove obsolete users.
	<LI>Remove unused application systems. Candidate unused application systems are skeleton applications with no shares
	to 'actual' application systems or 'old' versioned application systems.
	<LI>Remove obsolete objects and unshare unused objects
	<LI>Consider the removal of User Defined Sets. Although User Defined Sets are still available in Oracle Designer
	6i they will - by definition - not capture specific object versions. The object versions visible in a User Defined
	Set may change over time. You should use configurations instead if you want to capture specific object versions
	persistently like a change request.
	<LI>Reconnect your application systems that receive shares from 'obsolete' application systems to actual application
	systems.&nbsp; For example if HSD505 receives shares (e.g. preference sets) from QMS342, you could reconnect to
	for example QMS505 or higher by archiving HSD505 only and immediately restore HSD505 (as HSD505_copy) with the
	reconnect option to QMS505. Note that archiving the single application system HSD505 will result in a skeleton
	share from QMS342 and that the reconnect option - while restoring - allows you to reconnect the skeleton application
	to other application systems.
	<LI>Remove unused diagrams (e.g. old versions) and diagrams that can be fully derived from the repository content
	(e.g. Module diagrams)
	<LI>Consolidate all other diagrams.&nbsp; The visual diagram information is stored separately from the structured
	elements and their properties and may therefore not always be in sync. The consolidate option synchronizes the
	diagram information with the information of the structured elements and their properties. To consolidate a diagram
	in Release 2.x./6.0, open it and choose Edit &gt; Consolidate &gt; All.
	<LI>Remove any parent/child relationships between application systems. There is no such thing as a Parent/child
	relationship in the context of Oracle Designer 6i.
</UL>

<P>The application interdependencies - implemented by one or more shares between application systems - can be very
complex. It may not be very obvious how application systems are mutually dependent. The Quickscan Analyzer utility
of the Oracle Echo tool set is able to visualise the content and mutual dependencies between application systems
via an Entity Relationship Diagram. The tool depicts a repository content (or a sub-selection of application systems)
into a specific Quick Scan application system, an application system into an entity, object types instances into
attributes and shares into relationships. An example of a quickscan ERD is given below:</P>

<H2><A NAME="Other%20hints%20and%20tips%20based%20on%20mi"></A>Other hints and tips based on migration best practices</H2>
<P>Below you will find a comprehensive overview of migration best practices of structured data based on Oracle
Designer 6i migration - abstracted from Metalink between July 2000 and February 2001:<FONT COLOR="red"></FONT></P>

<UL>
	<LI>Apply the appropriate - latest available patch levels in target and destination repository.&nbsp; You can find
	these patches for Designer/Oracle Repository releases on metalink
	<LI>Apply the same database character sets in the target and destination database that host the repositories.
	<LI>Preferably start the migration as the repository owner. Although the migration is supported as a subordinate
	user you must realize that you need specific database access rights to successfully end the migration of one or
	more application systems - see also the Oracle Designer 6i installation guide.&nbsp; In addition there is the issue
	of application system ownership. The migration user will automatically become the application system owner. He/she
	needs then to transfer that ownership to another - administrative - user. Your user management and subsequent access
	rights can become extremely labor intensive if you introduce multiple application system owners.
	<LI>The migration should not be started from multiple workstations simultaneously.&nbsp; Once you start the migration
	wizard on one workstation do not attempt to start another migration session on another workstation until the first
	session is successfully completed.
	<LI>Verify that you have the same tnsnames.ora running on your source and destination database node. Your tnsnames.ora
	on your destination database node that hosts your Oracle Designer 6i repository should be equal to your tnsnames.ora
	on your Oracle Designer 6i workstation. The wizard itself will create a database link from the source Designer
	6.0 repository to the target Oracle Designer 6i repository. Note that the process that creates this database link
	is executed on the database server and not on your workstation - unless your source and destination database is
	running locally
	<LI>No manipulation of data should take place during the migration in the target and source repositories.
	<LI>If you are still using Designer 2.1.x, migrate your repository first to Oracle Designer 6.0 and apply the latest
	Oracle Designer 6.0 patch level (Patch 7 was available in&nbsp; February 2002). There are several issues with migrating
	from a Designer 2.1.x repository that were solved once moved forward to Designer 6.0.
	<LI>Pilot a large volume set of application systems first.&nbsp; If you are planning to migrate a large volume
	of application systems in an existing populated repository you should pilot this type of migration in a shadow
	environment and examine the logging of the migration carefully if it does not complete successfully. As an alternative
	to a shadow environment you could also choose to restore a pre-migration database backup if the migration fails.
</UL>

<P>Note that specific migration best practices for database elements, Oracle Developer components (e.g. Forms,
Reports, Libraries and Menus) and WEB PL/SQL components are handled in parts 3, 4 and 5 of this migration guide
respectively.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Migration%20steps%20from%20an%20Oracle%20D"></A>Migration steps from an Oracle Designer 1.3.2 repository

<P><I>You may skip this stage if you have already migrated to Oracle Designer 6.0.</I></P>
<P>The migration method for structured data is supported only if starting from an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository.
You have to apply the following migration steps if your current release of Oracle Designer is 1.3.2.</P>
<P>Load the user extensibility (if applicable)</P>
<P>Migrate via the Repository Administration Utility Upgrade tool or migrate via application system extracts.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Unload%20Oracle%20Designer%201.3.2%20use"></A>Unload Oracle Designer 1.3.2 user extensibility (optional)</H3>
<P><I>Obviously you can skip this activity if you have not defined any user extensibility or if you do not want
to bring forward the user extensibility into the Oracle Designer 6i repository</I>.</P>
<P>You first have to unload the Oracle Designer 1.3.2 user extensibility in order to keep your user extensibility.
The unload option is available from the Oracle Designer 1.3.2 Repository Administration Utility.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Load%20Oracle%20Designer%201.3.2%20user%20"></A>Load Oracle Designer 1.3.2 user extensibility into

<P>If you want to bring forward the user extensibility in the Oracle Designer 6i repository you have to load the
user extensibility in a fresh Oracle Designer 6.0 repository before loading any application system. You only have
to load the Oracle Designer 1.3.2 user extensibility into an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository if you apply the migration
strategy via extracted application systems.</P>

<P>If you have chosen the &quot;migrate entire repository content&quot; migration strategy (see above), install
the Oracle Designer 6.0 client software and launch the Upgrade utility from the Oracle Designer 6.0 Repository
Administration utility to bring your entire repository content forward to Oracle Designer 6.0.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Migration%20via%20extracted%20applicat"></A>Migration via extracted application systems</H3>
<P>Use the application restore option (available in the Repository Object Navigator) if you have chosen the sub-selection
migration strategy (see above).</P>
<P>Note that you have to select a coherent set of application systems in order to circumvent skeleton application
systems. Note also that it requires additional migration effort if any changes are applied to the selected application
systems in the Oracle Designer 1.3.2 repository after the migration has taken place. You may use the freeze application
system option (as a rather rigid method) to prohibit any changes in the Oracle Designer 1.3.2 repository just after
the migration.</P>
<P>You should verify the migration logging in the repadm60\log directory before moving on to the Oracle Designer
6i migration.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Migration%20steps%20from%20an%20Oracle%20D"></A>Migration steps from an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository
to Oracle Designer 6i repository</H2>
<P>Apply the following migration steps if your current release of Oracle Designer is 6.0:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Load the User Extensibility
	<LI>Launch the migration wizard
	<LI>Check in structured elements
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Unload%20Oracle%20Designer%206.0%20user%20"></A>Unload Oracle Designer 6.0 user extensibility (optional)</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image014.jpg" WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Unload" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1033"></P>
<P><I>Obviously you can skip this activity if you have not defined any user extensibility or if you do not want
to bring forward the user extensibility into the Oracle Designer 6i repository</I></P>
<P>In order to keep your user extensibility you first have to unload the Oracle Designer 6.0 user extensibility.
The unload option is available from the Oracle Designer 6.0 RAU utility.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Load%20Oracle%20Designer%206.0%20user%20ex"></A>Load Oracle Designer 6.0 user extensibility into Oracle
Designer 6i (optional)</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image016.jpg" WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Load" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1034"></P>
<P>If you want to bring forward the user extensibility into the Oracle Designer 6i repository you first have to
load the user extensibility in a fresh Oracle Designer 6i repository before migrating any application system. You
always have to load the Oracle Designer 6.0 user extensibility into a fresh Oracle Designer 6i repository for both
migration strategies.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Launch%20the%20migration%20wizard"></A>Launch the migration wizard</H3>
<P>Read the migration section of the Oracle Designer 6i Installation Guide before launching the migration wizard.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image018.jpg" WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Launch" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1035"></P>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i migration method for structured elements has changed significantly. An Oracle Designer
6.0 repository will not be upgraded to an Oracle Designer 6i repository during the migration. The Oracle Designer
6.0 repository content (or part of it) will be copied into a fresh installed (or already populated) Oracle Designer
6i repository.</P>
<P>It should be noted that the migration wizard will actually clean up your Oracle Designer 6.0 repository. The
migration wizard will for example correct invalid references, populate missing properties, update invalid properties
or force delete duplicate values. This cleanup is optimized for Oracle Designer 6i. You should therefore not reuse
your Designer 6.0 repository for these application systems that are migrated to Oracle Designer 6i. You should
use a target shadow Oracle Designer 6.0 repository if you are still planning to use the Oracle Designer 6.0.</P>
<P>The migration wizard allows you to connect to an Oracle Designer 6.0 repository and subsequently select one
or more application systems. Apply the specific migration strategy as discussed before.</P>
<P>The wizard will verify if there are any incoming shares from other application systems that were not selected.
These application systems will be added to the selection in order to circumvent skeleton application systems. A
skeleton application system only captures the objects that are shared to one or more other application systems.
It does not contain all objects. The selection of a coherent set of application systems is extremely important.
Note that coherency is not only about receiving shares but also about outgoing shares. For example if you migrate
the single application QMS505 (1) first and secondly the application HSD505(1) you would receive QMS505(1) again
because of the incoming shares of QMS505 to HSD505. See the example of a quickscan ERD given in the section &quot;Preparing
(cleaning up) your 'old' repository content&quot;, above. You should however not re-select an application system
that has already been (implicitly) migrated. In this example you should migrate HSD505 and QMS505 as a set.</P>
<P>The wizard will populate a workarea called GLOBAL_SHARED_WORKAREA with the migrated data if your repository
is not version enabled.</P>
<P>The wizard will populate the migrated data in a new system generated workarea if your repository is (already)
version enabled. The name of that workarea will be based upon the connect string (e.g. WA_des60_ds6). You should
verify the Workarea rule of this system generated workarea. You should change this rule to your own specifications
if it contains the following rule INCLUDE_FOLDER(SYSTEM FOLDER{MAIN;LATEST}) and if you are planning to check in
the structured elements. This specific rule will evaluate the content of the system folder only after you have
checked in your structured elements. It will not display your structured elements. You will find more information
about workarea and workarea rules in a paper by Lucas Jellema, called &quot;Interior Oracle Designer 6i<I>&quot;
</I>published for the ODTUG2000 and in Chapter 6 &quot;Reorganize a migrated Oracle Designer 6i repository&quot;.
Note that you cannot reuse previously created workareas.</P>
<P>You can control, as in Oracle Designer 2.1.x and Oracle Designer 6.0, to a certain extent, the migration operation
while it is in progress. The migration operation is divided into a number of stages. You can pause and restart
the current stage, retry or skip a stage that failed, or abandon the whole operation.</P>
<P>The Control Status dialog box is displayed while the upgrade is in progress, and includes a number of buttons
for the different controls.</P>
<P>For example, if you ran out of extents in the rollback segment during an upgrade, you could pause the upgrade
at its current stage, allocate a larger rollback segment, then restart the upgrade from the stage where the failure
occurred.</P>
<P>It is highly recommended that you verify the content of the migration log files, written to the ORACLE_HOME\repadm61\logs
directory, during or after the migration.</P>
<P>Application systems are migrated as application systems suffixed with the application version number (e.g. &quot;HSD505
(1) or QMS505 (1)&quot;) and not as (root) folders. There is no option (yet) to transfer application systems as
(root) folders (or vice versa).</P>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i repository content may look as follows just after the migration of your structured data:</P>

<P><I>If you do not want to enter the versioned world (yet) you may skip this activity.</I></P>
<P>The migration wizard groups all migrated application systems initially either in a default workarea called GLOBAL_SHARED_WORKAREA
or in a specific migration workarea (e.g. WA_DES6I_DES6I) if you have a version enabled repository.</P>
<P>Execute the following steps if you do want to enter the versioned world.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Verify the access rights of the repository owner against the workareas and the underlying containers.
	<LI>Check in all structured objects via the &quot;List Checkouts&quot; option
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Verify%20the%20access%20rights"></A>Verify the access rights</H4>
<P>Verify the access rights against the (default) workareas and migrated application systems of the Oracle Designer
6i repository owner.&nbsp; The Oracle Designer 6i repository owner must have the version privilege for both objects
in order to check in the objects within the context of workareas. The following shows access rights against workareas
and application systems:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image022.jpg" WIDTH="638" HEIGHT="309" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Grant Access Rights" BORDER="0"
v:shapes="_x0000_i1037"></P>

<P>Note that you can select multiple workareas and application systems at the same time - via a discontinuous select
- to review and define the access rights for the <A NAME="2-3"></A>specific user.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Check%20in%20structured%20objects"></A>Check in structured objects</H4>
<P>The migration wizard has loaded your structured elements in the repository, but it did not check in the objects.
The Oracle Designer 6i Repository Object Navigator has an option to check in <I>all </I>non-versioned objects simultaneously.
This &quot;List Checkouts…&quot; option is available for each container via the right mouse button and will launch
the List CheckOuts Criteria dialog:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image024.jpg" WIDTH="626" HEIGHT="379" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="List Checkouts" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1038"></P>
<P>In the context of migration you are only interested in a list of &quot;non-versioned&quot; objects.</P>
<P>Clicking the OK button will launch a window with all non-versioned objects for the highlighted container:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image025.jpg" WIDTH="626" HEIGHT="379" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="List checkouts" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1039"></P>
<P>You can only check in owned non-versioned objects. You cannot check in non-owned short-cuts. These objects should
not be highlighted in the list, while checking in all non-versioned objects.</P>
<P>It is very useful to apply the same check-in notes (e.g. &quot;Initial creation&quot;) for all non-versioned
objects in the check-in windows, as illustrated below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image027.jpg" WIDTH="458" HEIGHT="374" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Check in" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1040"></P>
<P>You should realize that once you have checked in your first object(s) you actually have entered the versioned
world. From that moment on you cannot re-enter the non-versioned world - other than by recreating a fresh Oracle
Designer 6i repository and re-starting the migration in a non-versioned mode. The check-in operation is an irreversible
action.</P>
<P>Checking-in of the subordinate non-versioned objects via the &quot;List Checkouts&quot; option does automatically
imply a check-in of the application system. Most likely you would like to apply your naming standard for application
systems or containers in general. For example, you could change the default migration application name &quot;HSD505
(1)&quot; into HST and &quot;QMS505 (1)&quot; into QMS just before the batch checkin of all subordinate objects.
Note also that you have to check out an object to apply any changes - including the name of the application system.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Post%20migration%20steps%20for%20structu"></A>Post migration steps for structured data</H2>
<P>This stage covers activities for structured data that are not handled by the migration wizard:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Remove the suffix “(1)” from your migrated application system name
	<LI>Translate (old) parent application systems to a nested container structure
	<LI>Build a version tree for structured data

<P>Remove the suffix “(1)” from your migrated application system name or any other version indication suffix. The
command line tool may not cope with suffixes appropriately.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Translate%20(old)%20parent%20applicati"></A>Translate (old) parent application systems to a nested
container structure</H3>
<P><I>Skip this activity if you have not defined a hierarchy of application systems (also known as parent application
systems) in previous releases of Oracle Designer.</I></P>
<P>You should realize that the implementation of application systems hierarchies is quite different in Oracle Designer
6i to the implementation of application system hierarchies in previous releases of Oracle Designer. Oracle Designer
6i allows you to define a hierarchy of containers: application systems may contain other application systems or
folders. Folders may contain other folders or application systems. All containers - no matter their position in
the hierarchy - could contain subordinate objects (e.g. entities, tables) in Oracle Designer 6i as opposed to previous
releases in Oracle Designer. In previous releases of Oracle Designer only subordinate application systems could
contain subordinate objects.</P>
<P>Reconsider therefore the application system hierarchy before and after the migration. Note that you should have
removed the parent/child relationship between application systems prior to migration.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Building%20a%20version%20tree%20for%20stru"></A>Building a version tree for structured data</H3>
<P><I>Skip this activity if you do not want to enter (yet) the versioned world or if you do not (yet) want to have
multiple object versions.</I></P>
<P>The only way to store multiple object versions in previous releases of Oracle Designer was by the creation of
an additional application system via archive/restore, or by versioning an application system. Within these additional
application systems you could store the same object (name) of the same type with a different definition. These
different object definitions represented another object version.</P>
<P>The migration wizard will not migrate these different object versions as a version tree. The migration wizard
will handle these object versions as totally different objects.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Build%20a%20version%20tree%20manually"></A>Build a version tree manually</H4>
<P>The manual build of a version tree of structured elements comprises the following steps (see also the illustration
that follows):</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Check out the context element (with the lowest version definition) from the default migration workarea (e.g.
	QMS_MESASAGE_TXT [1.0]).
	<LI>Apply the changes manually based upon the definitions captured in QMS505_DEV (1)\ QMS_MESASAGE_TXT .
	<LI>Compare the two versions with the compare utility and verify this result with the Oracle Designer 1.3.2 environment.
	You can launch the compare prevision version utility directly via the checked out object.
	<LI>Check in the manually changed version of the object (e.g. QMS_MESASAGE_TXT [1.1]).
</OL>

<P>Repeat steps 1 to 4 until no more additional versions need to be built manually.</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Create a workarea called WA_&lt;ddmmyyyy&gt; with rule LATEST_BEFORE that represents a snapshot of your repository
	just after the initial checkin of your structured elements (and files). Note that this workarea also represents
	the content of your &quot;original&quot; repository before any interim changes have been applied. You should not
	allow anyone to make any changes via this workarea.

</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Compute%20statistics%201"></A>Compute statistics</H3>
<P>To avoid a degradation in repository performance, we recommend that you run the Compute Statistics utility (available
at the Oracle Designer 6i RAU tab sheet) regularly, and especially after an operation that significantly affects
the size of the repository.</P>
<P>Note that the migration automatically launches a compute statistics stage. Therefore you do not have to run
the compute statistics directly after a migration.</P>
<P>In Release 6<I>i</I>, you can run the utility directly from the Repository Administration Utility window by
clicking the Compute Statistics button:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image033.jpg" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1043"></P>
<P>In most cases, we recommend using a higher figure than the default (e.g. 50%). However, if your repository has
large tables, it is especially important to use lower figures for the sample size, as higher figures will cause
the compute operation to take a long time to complete.</P>
<P>In addition is highly recommended to implement a daily batch mechanism that computes the statistics of the dynamic
repository tables.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Reevaluate%20preference%20sets"></A>Reevaluate preference sets</H3>

<H1><A NAME="Chapter%204%20Migrate%20files%20from%20thi"></A>Chapter 4 Migrate files from third party source control
tools</H1>
<P>The migration of files, stored in a third party source control tool, should typically start after the migration
of the structured elements. Only then are you able to integrate your files with the structured elements - both
type of elements will then share the same root-container.</P>
<P>The migration of files into Oracle Designer 6i comprises the following steps:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Populate the file system with a baseline set of files
	<LI>Populate the Oracle Designer 6i repository
</UL>

<P><I>Skip this chapter if you have not stored your files in a third party source control tool. (e.g. PVCS/VM,
ClearCase, Visual Source Safe).</I></P>
<P>The migration of files stored in a third party source control tool will be clarified using an abstract of 'Headstart
5.0.5' files. It is assumed that the files are captured in two project databases in PVCS/VM : HST and QMS respectively
(as illustrated below).</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image035.jpg" WIDTH="442" HEIGHT="247" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1044"></P>
<P>PVCS/VM is a source control tool like ClearCase or VisualSource that supports the storage of multiple file versions,
workspace procedures and several other configuration management procedures.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Populate%20the%20file%20system%20with%20a%20"></A>Populate the file system with a baseline set of
files</H2>
<P>The migration of files will be based upon the file upload functionality in Oracle Designer 6i. The migration
strategy of files will not be based upon an interpretation of the third part source control repository.</P>
<P>The migration steps for files stored in a source control tool will be illustrated by using PVCS/VM as an example.
Note that you could apply the same migration strategy for files stored in other source control tools (e.g. ClearCase,
Visual Source Safe). Most likely these other tools have similar options available to publish your repository content
- via a specific filter - on the file system.</P>
<P>The publication of a baseline file set should typically be organised in the following stages:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Get an overview of your third party source control tool repository
	<LI>Clean up your third party source control tool repository
	<LI>Determine a generic directory structure
	<LI>Publish the baseline set of files on the file system.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Get%20an%20overview%20of%20your%20third%20pa"></A>Get an overview of your third party source control
tool repository</H3>
<P>Your third party source control may have several reports or options available to visualise the repository content
of file versions. Such an overview will effectively support you with the publication of a baseline set of files.</P>
<P>For example PVCS/VM offers an option to export the administrative information (e.g. projects, files, file versions,
group association with file versions) into an Oracle database. Subsequently you can build reports (using SQL*Plus)
to generate an overview of your PVCS/VM repository content that may look as follows:</P>

<PRE>…</PRE>
<P>Note: <A HREF="mg_appendix-a_6i-2.htm">Appendix A</A> contains an example of a SQL query - based on the PVCS/VM
administration tables - that has&nbsp; generated the above report.</P>
<P>The above report is based upon the functionality in PVCS/VM that enables you to associate one or more promotion
groups - see report headers - to a specific file version. In PVCS/VM you can also associate one or more release
labels to a specific file version. You could generate a similar report with release numbers in the column headers
instead of promotion groups.</P>
<P>The PVCS/VM content for the file announcement.doc should look as follows:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image037.jpg" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="287" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1045"></P>
<P>Note that the exported PVCS/VM administrative information is static. It does not reflect any changes after you
have exported the data from the PVCS/VM repository. You should therefore export the administrative data multiple
times if there are any cleanup activities based upon the first output - and that is most likely to happen.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Clean%20up%20your%20third%20party%20source"></A>Clean up your third party source control tool repository</H3>
<P>The upload is an excellent opportunity to clean up your repository content of the third party source control
tool. You can apply the following clean-up checklist for files captured in third party source tools, using the
overview, as discussed in the previous section:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Remove unused containers and/or sub-containers. The equivalent of a container in PVCS/VM is called a project
	database and a sub-container is called a project.
	<LI>Remove obsolete files.
	<LI>Remove obsolete (interim) object versions. Candidate obsolete or interim file versions are file versions that
	are not used or associated with a release or a promotion level.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Determine%20a%20generic%20directory%20st"></A>Determine a generic directory structure</H3>
<P>The upload will not only capture the files, but also the owning directories. You should therefore investigate
the content of the source control tool for each specific project (or any other root grouping vehicle) in terms
of (sub)folders and file types. Subsequently you can determine a generic directory structure based upon this investigation.</P>
<P>Example: Your files in a specific project database could already been organized in a specific (nested) folder
structure (see the illustration below) or you could group your files in one or more sub-folders based upon the
file extension if your project database is not organized in sub-folders.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image039.jpg" WIDTH="521" HEIGHT="329" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1046"></P>
<P>The illustration above shows that a directory structure for HST and QMS is already available. If such a structure
is not yet available you could set up a directory structure based upon your file system structure HST and QMS respectively.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Publish%20the%20baseline%20set%20of%20file"></A>Publish the baseline set of files on the file system</H3>
<P>Your third party source control tool probably supports the functionality to publish a set of files of a specific
version based upon the promotion group association or a release label association. Specifically, this &quot;get&quot;
option is very effective for the migration of files. You can use this option to publish a baseline set of your
files to a specific destination directory structure. For example you could publish all your file versions that
are associated with the group 'development' (as shown in the dialog below) to the stage area 'f:\stage\hst\' or
you could start to publish all your file versions that are associated with version label 5.0.5. The &quot;Get&quot;
option in the screen dump below will publish all file versions and its owning folders and subfolders that are associated
with the promotion group &quot;development&quot; to directory f:\stage\hst .</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image041.jpg" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="252" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1047"></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image043.jpg" WIDTH="424" HEIGHT="374" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1048"></P>
<P>The window above depicts the promotion group association in PVCS/VM against file versions. The 1.1 version of
the elcheapo.doc file is associated with the promotion group &quot;Development&quot; while the 1.0 version of is
associated with &quot;Production&quot;.</P>
<P>Note that if you want to bring forward multiple file versions (see the section &quot;Building a version tree
for files&quot;), you have to start with a baseline or lowest version in the publish step. Your baseline version
will probably be captured in the production environment. If you do not want to bring forward multiple file versions
you have to &quot;get&quot; and upload the latest file versions. These latest versions are probably associated
with the &quot;development&quot; promotion group.</P>
<P>Your (populated) file system may look as follows after the (first) publish operation for project HST for the
sub-folder scripts.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image045.jpg" WIDTH="367" HEIGHT="157" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1049"></P>
<P>Note that you may have to move your files after the publish operation to a specific sub-directory if you did
not organize your sources in a specific sub-folder structure beforehand. The move operation should typically be
based upon the output of your investigation to a generic directory (see also the section &quot;Determine a generic
directory structure&quot;).</P>
<P>Your third party source control tool may also have publish options that are accessible from the command line
interface or via an API. For example PVCS/VM offers a GET option via a Command Line Interface in a 'DOS' session
that allows you to get a multiple set of file versions either based upon a release label or a promotion group.
Therefore you may prefer the Command Line Interface instead of the GUI interface to execute the publish operation
as a batch job.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Populate%20the%20Oracle9i%20Designer%20r"></A>Populate the Oracle Designer 6i repository</H2>
<P>In this activity you will populate the Oracle Designer 6i repository with the (first) set of files. The populate
operation is divided into two steps:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Apply (root) folder mapping
	<LI>Upload the files - and check in if applicable
</UL>

<P>Every insert, update or delete operation on the Oracle Designer 6i repository must be executed within the context
of a specific workarea.</P>
<P>If you are not planning to enable the repository for versioning you have to use the default migration workarea
GLOBAL_SHARED_WORKAREA.</P>
<P>Otherwise you can use any workarea for the migration of files since you have the intention to check in the file
objects. Note that every checked in object can be accessed eventually in every workarea (depending on the workarea
rules).</P>
<H3><A NAME="Apply%20(root)%20folder%20mapping"></A>Apply (root) folder mapping</H3>
<P>The upload (and check-in of files if applicable) must be preceded by a folder mapping. The &quot;Map Folder
to the File System&quot; option is available for each root container - at the right mouse button for a specific
root container.</P>
<P>This folder mapping option allows you to upload the file system content (directory and files) with the repository.&nbsp;
See below.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image047.gif" WIDTH="349" HEIGHT="210" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1050"></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image049.gif" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="256" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1051"></P>
<P>For example the directory &quot;f:\stage\hst\&quot; will be mapped to the HST container and the directory &quot;f:\stage\qms\&quot;
will be mapped to the QMS container. See below.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image051.gif" WIDTH="343" HEIGHT="279" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1052"></P>
<P>Note that the files - and their folders and subfolders - in the Headstart example will be uploaded (and checked
in if applicable) against the existing containers (e.g. HST and QMS). Obviously you could also bring the files
forward in other or new &quot;to be created&quot; containers.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Upload%20of %20files"></A>Upload of&nbsp; files</H3>
<P>The upload will actually store the files in the repository. In addition it will also bring all directories and
sub-directories forward if you have enabled the &quot;Recurse into sub-directories&quot; option (see the following
dialog box). It is therefore important that you have applied a generic folder structure, since that structure will
be loaded in the repository as well.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image053.gif" WIDTH="445" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1053"></P>
<H3><A NAME="Check-in%20of%20files"></A>Check-in of files</H3>
<P><I>Skip this section if you do not want to enter the versioned world.</I></P>
<P>If you want to check in your files, you can either combine the upload with a check-in or you can use the &quot;list
checkouts…&quot; option (as with the structured elements). The check-in of files will actually apply a version
number to the stored files.</P>
<P>As with structured elements you should realise that once you have checked in your first file(s) you have actually
entered the versioned world. From that moment on you cannot re-enter the non-versioned world - other than by re-creating
a fresh Oracle Designer 6i repository and re-starting the migration in a non-versioned mode. The check-in operation
is an irreversible action.</P>
<P>Note that you can verify the &quot;check-in&quot; status of all file elements (including folders) via the &quot;list
checkouts…&quot; option per root-container. Eventually this option should not feed back any file elements.</P>
<P>The container and sub-container structure for application system HST looks as follows after the upload and check-in
operation:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image055.gif" WIDTH="444" HEIGHT="474" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1054"></P>
<H3><A NAME="Upload%20and%20check%20in%20sources%20and%20"></A>Upload and check-in sources and executables</H3>
<P>Next to the storage of structured elements you may consider the upload and check-in of the derived sources and
corresponding executables. For example you could also upload the derived Oracle Forms FMB source (e.g. HSD0004F.FMB)
and corresponding executable (e.g. HSD0004F.FMX) next to the migrated structured form itself (Oracle Forms 60 module
HSD0004F). In addition you could also upload multiple representations of your sources and executables, for example
Forms50 and Forms60. You can organise your multiple representation either via different folders (e.g., demof50,
demof60) or via the use of different labels.</P>
<P>With all representations available in the repository you could instantly build your environment (via the download
option) from the repository content without the derivation (or generation) step from a structured format into a
derived source and executable. You can then gradually replace the source and the executable with the new generated
and compiled representation over time. Your Oracle Designer 6i repository can act as a single point of control
just after the migration: It captures all your application objects necessary for a 'runtime' environment, as below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image057.jpg" WIDTH="445" HEIGHT="479" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1055"></P>
<H2><A NAME="Post%20migration%20steps%20for%20files%20s"></A>Post migration steps for files stored in a third party
source control tool</H2>
<P>There are the following (possible) post migration steps for files:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Build a version tree for files
	<LI>Verify the migrated files
	<LI>Compute statistics
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Building%20a%20version%20tree%20for%20file"></A>Building a version tree for files</H3>
<P>It is quite easy to build a version tree for files stored in a third party source control tool (compared with
structured elements).</P>
<P><I>Skip this activity if you do not (yet) want to enter the versioned world or if you do not (yet) want to have
multiple object versions of files.</I></P>
<P>If you want to bring forward multiple file versions you have to start with a baseline or lowest version in the
publish step as discussed above. Obviously the version tree should be built starting from the lowest version.</P>
<P>If you are planning to build a version tree, you can build it either:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>immediately, or
	<LI>in time.
</UL>

<P>The build of a version tree for files should be based upon an overview as was presented in the section &quot;Get
an overview of your third party source control tool repository&quot;, above. Such an overview of the third party
source control content, i.e. which file versions are available and with which promotion groups or release labels
are these file versions associated, is not only very productive, but also quality effective for verification purposes.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Building%20a%20version%20tree%20immediat"></A>Building a version tree immediately</H4>
<P>In this activity you will bring one or more file versions forward immediately from your third party source control
tool to Oracle Designer 6i.</P>
<P>Building a version tree (immediately) comprises the following task steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Check-out the relevant file in Oracle Designer 6i (with a lock) that has multiple versions in your third party
	source control.
	<LI>Get the file from your third party source control (without a lock) and overwrite the file on the file system
	in the prepared directory.
	<LI>Upload and check in the file in Oracle Designer 6i.
</OL>

<P>These steps are illustrated below for the file Announcement.doc.</P>
<P>Repeat these steps for each file that needs multiple versions and no more versions are available in your third
party source control tool. For example file Announcement.doc has 3 versions (1.0, 1,1 and 1,2) and therefore you
have to repeat this activity twice.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image059.gif" WIDTH="377" HEIGHT="227" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1056"></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image061.gif" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="221" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1057"></P>
<P>Building a version tree for files (immediately) should typically be performed by a developer. You therefore
have to give intermediate access to developers that are responsible for these post-migration activities. Consult
<A HREF="#Chapter%207%20Migrate%20users%20and%20assi">Chapter 7 &quot;Migrate users and assign access privileges&quot;</A>
for guidelines on repository access rights to the repository itself, to workareas and to containers.</P>
<P>Note that it is not necessary to run the compare utility after a build of another version. The build of another
version is not as complex as with structured objects. Note also that the Oracle Designer 6i repository has not
implemented any kind of delta storage method while storing another file version. Another file version is just stored
completely. In addition you can store a file in the repository either compressed or uncompressed.</P>
<P>Finally note that the above scenario can be very time consuming if you have many files with many file versions.
You can then speed up the process by checking in only relevant file versions. For example only document1.doc version
1.0 and version 1.2 are used, while document version 1.1 is not used anywhere anymore. In this specific example
you only need one extra activity to check in document1.doc version 1.2.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Building%20your%20version%20tree%20in%20ti"></A>Building your version tree in time</H4>
<P>During this activity you are building the version tree in time. You execute the check-out and check-in steps
(as described and illustrated in the previous paragraph) whenever you need an additional version of a file. Your
third party source control tool will be kept 'alive' (in read-only mode) as long as you need additional versions.</P>
<P>If you apply this migration method, you will also start with the lowest available file version, since you are
eventually interested in the version tree. You can only build a version tree starting from the initial version.</P>
<P>You have to bring forward the additional file versions in the following circumstances:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Setup of another promotion environment that involves versions other than those already available in Oracle
	Designer 6i.
	<LI>Setup of another release that involves versions other than those already available in Oracle Designer 6i.
	<LI>The continuation of development of one or more object versions that are not yet available in Oracle Designer
	6i.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Summary%20of%20migration%20strategies%20"></A>Summary of migration strategies for building a version
tree for files</H4>
<P>Several options for building a version tree for files stored in a third party source control tool were described
in the previous paragraphs. The following strategies are relevant if you combine these options:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>The build of a version tree for files is not yet planned.
	<LI>The build of a version tree for all file versions will be built immediately.
	<LI>The build of a version tree for only a limited number of file versions will be built immediately.
	<LI>The build of a version tree for only a limited number of file versions will be built in time.
</OL>

<P>Note that you can only select the most optimal strategy if you have full knowledge about the content of your
third party source control tool. Again the report presented in the section &quot;Get an overview of your third
party source control tool repository&quot;, above, is a very productive way to support your strategy for building
version trees.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Verify%20the%20migrated%20files"></A>Verify the migrated files</H3>
<P>You can verify your migration effort for files for the following dimensions:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Verify the file existence
	<LI>The existence of the appropriate number of additional versions (version tree)
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Verify%20the%20file%20existence"></A>Verify the file existence</H4>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i repository should contain the same number of files as in the third party source control
tool, unless one or more files are deliberately not brought forward to the Oracle Designer 6i repository.</P>
<P>You can use the Repository Object Navigator to view the file objects (see for example the illustration in &quot;Check-in
of files&quot;, above) or even better you can use the API to produce a list of file objects for each root-container.</P>
<H4><A NAME="The%20existence%20of%20the%20appropriate"></A>The existence of the appropriate number of additional
versions (version tree)</H4>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i repository should contain the appropriate number of file versions (or version tree) as
was available in the third party source control tool.</P>
<P>Note that the exact number of file versions may deviate from the original number of file versions depending
on the specific migration strategy for building a version tree for files (see previous paragraph).</P>
<P>Note also that the version number itself may deviate from the file version number if you have not brought forward
all file versions and at the same time you have opted for the automatic numbering policy.</P>
<P>You can use the Version History Viewer (see below) to look up a version tree. Subsequently you can use the report
presented in &quot;Building a version tree for files&quot; to compare the result in Oracle Designer 6i with the
content of your third party source control tool.</P>

<P>Now is a good time to rerun &quot;Compute Statistics&quot; since your repository content is expanded with file
objects (and maybe additional file versions). Running &quot;Compute Statistics&quot; will avoid a degradation in
repository performance.</P>
<P>In Oracle Designer 6i, you can run the utility directly from the Repository Administration Utility window by
clicking the Compute Statistics button:</P>

<H1><A NAME="Chapter%205%20Migrate%20files%20that%20are"></A>Chapter 5 Migrate files that are stored on the file
system</H1>
<P>The migration of files, stored on the file system, should typically start after the migration of the structured
elements. Only then are you able to integrate your files with the structured elements - both type of elements will
then share the same root-container.</P>
<P>The migration of files into Oracle Designer 6i comprises the following steps:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Populate the file system with a baseline set of files
	<LI>Populate the Oracle Designer 6i repository
</UL>

<P><I>Skip this chapter if you have already migrated your files from a third party source control tool or you do
not (yet) have any files to migrate.</I></P>
<P>The migration of files stored on the file system will be clarified using an abstract of 'Headstart 5.0.5' files.
It is assumed that the files are stored on the file system as depicted below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image065.jpg" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="167" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1060"></P>
<H2><A NAME="Populate%20the%20file%20system%20with%20a%20"></A>Populate the file system with a baseline set of
files</H2>
<P>The migration of files will be based upon the file upload functionality in Oracle Designer 6i.</P>
<P>The publication of a baseline file set should typically be organised in the following stages:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Restructure your file system content
	<LI>Publish the baseline set of files on the file system.
</UL>

<P>Note that your file structure containing your candidate files could be stored on a local drive, a network drive
or even on a Unix file system. Obviously in the case of a Unix file system you should have installed certain software
(e.g. Samba) to make the Unix file system transparent - presented as a network drive - on your NT or Windows95/98
workstation.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Restructure%20the%20file%20system"></A>Restructure the file system</H3>
<P>The upload is an excellent opportunity to restructure your file system. It is highly recommended to use a staging
area - a separate directory structure - in order not to interfere with ongoing development, testing or even production.</P>
<P>The restructure of the file system comprises the following stages:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Determination of a generic directory structure
	<LI>A clean-up of your file system
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Determination%20of%20a%20generic%20direc"></A>Determination of a generic directory structure</H4>
<P>The upload will not only capture the files, but also the owning directories. You should therefore investigate
the file system content for each specific root directory (e.g. HST, QMS) in terms of (sub)folders and file types.
Subsequently you can determine a generic directory structure based upon this investigation and create this generic
structure in the staging area.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Clean-up%20check-list"></A>Clean-up check-list</H4>
<P>Consult the following check-list to limit the number of files for uploading.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Obsolete objects
	<LI>Temporary files
	<LI>Compiled object versions
	<LI>Multiple instances
	<LI>&quot;out of context&quot; objects
</UL>

<P>Applying above check-list will result in an effective base line set, that you can upload and check-in to Oracle
Designer 6i.</P>
<P>It is assumed that the content in the staging area for HST and QMS, depicted at the beginning of this chapter,
is satisfactory. For example no clean-up actions are necessary.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Populate%20the%20Oracle9i%20Designer%20r"></A>Populate the Oracle Designer 6i repository</H2>
<P>The procedure for populating the repository with files stored on the file system in Oracle Designer 6i is the
same as for files stored in a third party source control tool, once you have populated the files in the staging
area.</P>
<P>Consult therefore &quot;Populate the Oracle Designer 6i repository&quot; in Chapter 4 for a complete overview
of the population steps.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Post%20migration%20steps%20for%20files%20s"></A>Post migration steps for files stored on the file
system</H2>
<P>There are the following (possible) post migration steps for files:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Building a version tree for files
	<LI>Verify the migrated files
	<LI>Compute statistics
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="Building%20a%20version%20tree%20for%20file"></A>Building a version tree for files</H3>
<P><I>Skip this activity if you do not yet want to enter the versioned world or if you do not yet want to have
multiple object versions of files.</I></P>
<P>It is much harder to build up a version tree for files that are stored on the file system compared with the
storage of files in a third party source control tool. It is more difficult to build&nbsp; an overview (see the
illustration below) because additional versions of a file must either be stored under a different name or on a
different location.</P>
<P>If you want to bring forward multiple file versions, you have to start with a baseline or lowest version in
the publish step as discussed above. Obviously the version tree should be built starting from the lowest version.</P>
<P>The build of a version tree for files should be based upon an overview of your file system content, i.e. which
file versions are available in which specific directories.</P>
<P>Your overview may look as follows:</P>
<PRE>Dir Filename&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version</PRE>
<PRE>…</PRE>
<PRE>HST announcement.doc</PRE>
<PRE>HST \hst\prd\doc\ announcement.doc&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0</PRE>
<PRE>HST \hst\acc\doc\ announcement.doc&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.0</PRE>
<PRE>HST \hst\tst\doc\ announcement11.doc 1.1</PRE>
<PRE>HST \hst\dev\doc\ announcement12.doc 1.2</PRE>
<PRE>…</PRE>
<PRE>QMS qmsolb50.olb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </PRE>
<PRE>QMS \qms\prd\demof60\ qmsolb50.olb&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.6</PRE>
<PRE>QMS \qms\acc\demof60\ qmsolb50.olb&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.6</PRE>
<PRE>QMS \qms\tst\demof60\ qmsolb5016.olb 1.6</PRE>
<PRE>QMS \qms\dev\demof60\ qmsolb5017.olb 1.7</PRE>
<PRE>…</PRE>
<P>Probably the only way to build such an overview is to investigate the file content file-by-file based on the
different file versions (either captured using another file name or in another location).</P>
<P>Building a version tree for files should typically be performed by a developer. You therefore have to give intermediate
access to developers that are responsible for these post-migration activities. Consult <A HREF="#Chapter%207%20Migrate%20users%20and%20assi">Chapter
7</A> for guidelines on repository access rights to the repository itself, to workareas and to containers.</P>
<P>Note that it is not necessary to run the compare utility after a build of another version. The build of another
version is not as complex as with structured objects. Note also that the Oracle Designer 6i repository does not
implement any kind of delta storage method while storing another file version. Another file version is just stored
completely. In addition you can store a file in the repository either compressed or uncompressed, to minimize the
size of your repository.</P>
<P>If you are planning to build a version tree for files, you can either build it:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>immediately or
	<LI>in time.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Building%20a%20version%20tree%20immediat"></A>Building a version tree immediately</H4>
<P>In this activity you will bring one or more file versions forward immediately from your file system to Oracle
Designer 6i.</P>
<P>Building a version tree (immediately) comprises the following task steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Check out the relevant file in Oracle Designer 6i (with a lock) that has multiple versions in your third party
	source control.
	<LI>Copy the 'next version' to your work directory. You will deliberately overwrite the file on the file system
	in your work directory. Note that you may have to rename the file if another version was captured as a different
	name.
	<LI>Upload and check in the file in Oracle Designer 6i.
</OL>

<P>These steps are illustrated below for the file Announcement.doc.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image067.gif" WIDTH="383" HEIGHT="227" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1061"></P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image069.gif" WIDTH="369" HEIGHT="221" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1062"></P>
<P>Repeat these steps for each file that needs multiple versions and no more versions are available. For example,
file Announcement.doc has three versions (1.0, 1,1 and 1,2) and therefore you have to repeat this activity twice.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Building%20your%20version%20tree%20in%20ti"></A>Building your version tree in time</H4>
<P>In this activity you will bring one or more file versions forward in time from your file system to Oracle Designer
6i.</P>
<P>Building a version tree (immediately) comprises the following task steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Check out the relevant file in Oracle Designer 6i (with a lock) that has multiple versions in your third party
	source control.
	<LI>Copy the 'next version' to your work directory. You will deliberately overwrite the file on the file system
	in your work directory. Note that you may have to rename the file if another version was captured as a different
	name.
	<LI>Upload and check in the file in Oracle Designer 6i.
</OL>

<P>These steps are the same as for building a version tree immediately. Consult therefore also the illustration
in &quot;Building a version tree immediately&quot;, above.</P>
<P>Repeat these steps for each file that needs multiple versions and no more versions are available. For example,
file Announcement.doc has three versions (1.0, 1,1 and 1,2) and therefore you have to repeat this activity twice.</P>
<P>Finally note that the above scenarios can be very time consuming if you have many files with many file versions.
You can then speed up the process by checking in only relevant file versions. For example only Announcement.doc
version 1.0 and version 1.2 are used, while announcement.doc version 1.1 is not used anywhere anymore. You only
need one extra activity to check in Announcement.doc version 1.2.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Summary%20of%20migration%20strategies%20"></A>Summary of migration strategies for files stored on
the file system</H4>
<P>Several options for building a version tree for files stored on the file system were described in the previous
paragraphs. The following strategies are relevant if you combine these options:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>The build of a version tree for files is not yet planned.
	<LI>The build of a version tree for all file versions will be built immediately.
	<LI>The build of a version tree for only a limited number of file versions will be built immediately.
	<LI>The build of a version tree for only a limited number of file versions will be built in time.
</OL>

<P>Note that you can only select the most optimal strategy if you have full knowledge about the content of your
file system. The report featured in &quot;Building a version tree for files&quot;, above, is a very productive
way to support your strategy for building version trees for files.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Verify%20the%20migrated%20files"></A>Verify the migrated files</H3>
<P>You should verify your migration effort for files for:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>the file existence

</UL>

<H4><A NAME="Verify%20the%20file%20existence"></A>Verify the file existence</H4>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i repository should contain the same number of files as stored on the file system. Unless
one or more files are deliberately not brought forward to the Oracle Designer 6i repository.</P>
<P>You can use the Repository Object Navigator to view the file objects (see for example the illustration in &quot;Check-in
of files&quot;, above) or even better you can use the API to produce a list of file objects for each root-container.</P>
<H4><A NAME="The%20existence%20of%20the%20appropriate"></A>The existence of the appropriate number of additional
versions (version tree)</H4>
<P>The Oracle Designer 6i repository should contain the appropriate number of file versions (or version tree) as
was available in the third party source control tool.</P>
<P>Note that the exact number of file versions may deviate from the original number of file versions depending
on the specific migration strategy for building a version tree for files (see previous section).</P>
<P>Note also that the version number itself may deviate from the file version number if you have not brought forward
all file versions and at the same time you have opted for the automatic numbering policy.</P>
<P>You can use the Version History Viewer (see below) to look up a version tree. Subsequently you can use the report
presented in &quot;Building a version tree for files&quot; to compare the result in Oracle Designer 6i with the
content of your third party source control tool.</P>

<P>Now is a good time to rerun &quot;Compute Statistics&quot; because your repository content is expanded with

<H1><A NAME="Chapter%206%20Reorganize%20a%20migrated%20"></A>Chapter 6 Reorganize a migrated Oracle Designer 6i
repository</H1>
<P>The migration of structured elements and/or files should be succeeded by reorganisation activities. These reorganization
steps involve the implementation of a specific implementation of your promotion model.</P>
<P>The following subjects are discussed in detail:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Define workareas and configurations
	<LI>Remove obsolete elements
	<LI>Compute statistics
</UL>

<P><I>There are only a limited number of reorganization options available in a non-versioned world. For example
you cannot create additional workareas next to the default 'GLOBAL_SHARED_WORKAREA'. You can only populate checked
in objects in another workarea, but there are no checked in objects in a non-versioned world. Also you cannot create
configurations since the configuration membership is based only upon checked in objects. Again no objects are checked
in in a non-versioned world. You can only (re)organize your repository through (nesting of) containers in a non-versioned
world.</I></P>
<P>You will find other and more comprehensive uses of workareas and configurations in a paper by Lucas Jellema
called &quot;Interior Oracle Designer 6i&quot; for the ODTUG2000 conference.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Define%20workareas%20and%20configurati"></A>Define workareas and configurations</H2>
<P>A promotion model can be implemented with a combination of workareas and configurations. If you adopt this specific
implementation then basically all workareas - except the development workarea - will be based upon configurations.</P>
<P>In this section we assume that your promotion model looks as follows:</P>
<P>Development</P>
<P>System test</P>
<P>System integration</P>
<P>Production</P>
<P>Production fix</P>
<P>Obviously your promotion model may have more or less promotion levels.</P>
<P>In this specific promotion model implementation you will create workareas that represent promotion environments.
In addition you may want to restrict each workarea in each promotion environment to one or more sub-systems. For
example you will create a workarea for the development environment that contains the latest folder content of folders
HST and QMS. A workarea for the test environment will be applicable to the same sub-systems, but it is based on
different workarea rules. For example the workarea WA_TST_HSD represents the test environment for HST and QMS and
is based on base line and patch configurations of HST and QMS. The term base line and patch configurations will
be explained below.</P>
<P>The following workarea rules are applicable in the above described promotion model:</P>
<P>&quot;LATEST(MAIN)&quot; for the development workarea or &quot;INCLUDE_FOLDER&quot; if you break up your repository
in different areas</P>
<P>&quot;INCLUDE_CONFIG&quot; for example for the production or system test workarea</P>
<P>All non-development workareas will be based on configurations. You could classify two types of configurations:</P>
<P>A configuration representing a specific (full) release or base line of a specific root container (e.g. HST_505).</P>
<P>A configuration representing a patch consisting of a limited number of configuration items owned by a specific
root container and applicable for a specific base line (e.g. HST_505_10).</P>
<P>Obviously you can create the non-development workareas only if you have defined one or more configurations.
You can create configurations (baselines and patches) via the configuration wizard.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image072.gif" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="204" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1065"></P>
<P>You can either populate a configuration via a combination of rules - similar to the population of workareas
- or you can just select objects from the repository (see the illustration above). Configuration rules are evaluated
once and result in a set of specific object versions. The configuration rules are not saved - as workarea rules
are.</P>
<P>You should verify that your configurations not only include the structured elements but also the files (captured
in folders). You will use the folders and files inclusion later on to build (or synchronize) your file system in
each of your promotion environments (see Chapter 8).</P>
<P>With one or more configurations you are able to create your non development workareas with the workarera wizard.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image074.gif" WIDTH="287" HEIGHT="186" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1066"></P>
<P>&quot;Base line&quot; configurations can effectively be created via configuration rules, while &quot;patch&quot;
configurations can be created via selecting the individual object versions.</P>
<P>The order in which you specify the workarea rules is very important. The workarea rules are evaluated from top
to bottom. Another object version will not be evaluated whenever an object version is already populated by a 'higher'
order workarea rule.</P>
<P>Your workarea for a specific promotion environment should eventually include one or more baseline configurations
and/or one or more corresponding patch configurations of corresponding interrelated containers, as illustrated
above.</P>
<P>Omitting one or more configurations may result in an incomplete definition of your components. For example your
module definition will be incomplete if you omit the configuration that captures your preference sets that were
initially defined (in the development environment) against your module.</P>
<P>Note that your development workarea ('WA_DEV_HSD') has a much more dynamic character then your 'other' workareas
since your development workarea is based upon the 'simple' rule LATEST(MAIN) or FOLDER_LATEST_CONTENT(HST{1.2}).
Your development workarea is changed each time an object is checked in. The 'other' workareas are only changed
for each promotion. Each promotion results either in a additional configuration and/or a change of the workarea
definition.</P>
<P>Note that the Oracle Designer 6i security model fully supports the implementation of promotions via workareas.
For example a developer may have write access on the container HST. At the same time he will probably have only
read access to workarea WA_PRD_HSD and only read access to folder c:\oap\hst\prd. He/she will never be able to
change the repository content in the production environment and he/she will not be able to synchronize the file
system in the production environment.</P>
<P>The number of configurations will grow significantly during the life time of an application. You should therefore
adopt a naming standard for configurations that identifies at least the following components in the configuration
name: &lt;root container name&gt;_&lt;base line release nr&gt;_(&lt;patch release&gt;). For example HST_505_11
represents patch 11 for base line 5.0.5 of container HST.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Different%20folder%20mappings%20in%20the"></A>Different folder mappings in the development workarea
for each developer</H2>
<P><I>You may skip this section if you do not (yet) want to enter the versioned world.</I></P>
<P>The above folder mappings for the development workarea should typically be defined by the project configuration
manager - Chapter 7 gives a detailed description of this specific user group - who is responsible for the content
of the development environment in the repository and eventually on the file system.</P>
<P>Developers however should not adopt this specific folder mapping for each root container in the development
environment They should adopt a private workspace for each container. They will not interfere with each other when
they use a private workspace for changing the files. This private workspace can either be set locally (e.g. c:\work\hst)
or on a share (f:\work\hst).</P>
<P>Note that the above &quot;private&quot; folder mapping is supported by Oracle Designer 6i since the folder mapping
is uniquely defined per workarea, container and workstation. The folder mapping is saved in the registry node HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Oracle\FileSystem\…
on each workstation.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Remove%20obsolete%20containers%20and%20o"></A>Remove obsolete containers and other objects</H2>
<P><I>Skip this activity if you do not (yet) want to enter the versioned world</I></P>
<P>In the previous tasks you may have created the following candidate obsolete objects:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Workareas that support the migration process (e.g. WA_des6i_ora8i)
	<LI>Additional application systems that captures additional object versions (e.g. HSD_TST)
</UL>

<P>The initial workareas were replaced by workareas that support the development and deployment process (e.g. WA_DEV_HSD,
WA_TST_HSD).</P>
<P>The additional application systems (not checked in) are no longer necessary once you have built the version
trees of one or more structured objects and you have verified the differences via the compare utility.</P>
<P>You can remove these application systems via the delete application system option (available while clicking
the right mouse button). However note that you have to follow a specific order to delete an application system
effectively. For instance you cannot delete an application system that has outgoing short-cuts.</P>
<P>Subsequently you can remove the 'migration' workareas. Note that all objects should either be checked in or
be removed to successfully delete a workarea.</P>
<P>Note also that the Oracle Designer 6i repository has adopted a wastebasket strategy. Deleted objects will appear
in the wastebasket. You should subsequently empty the wastebasket to remove the objects definitely from the repository.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Compute%20statistics%201"></A>Compute statistics</H2>
<P>Now is a good time to rerun the &quot;Compute Statistics&quot; since your repository content is reorganized
(and cleaned up). The &quot;Compute Statistics&quot; run will avoid a degradation in repository performance.</P>
<P>In Release 6i, you can run the utility directly from the Repository Administration Utility window by clicking
the Compute Statistics button:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image064.jpg" WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1067"></P>
<H1><A NAME="Chapter%207%20Migrate%20users%20and%20assi"></A>Chapter 7 Migrate users and assign access privileges</H1>
<P>Your Oracle Designer 6i repository should by now contain different workareas, containers and sub-containers,
configurations and of course structured elements and files. These objects are however not yet accessible to subordinate
users. Guidelines for creating subordinate users and the distribution of the appropriate access rights on the previously
mentioned objects will be discussed in this section.</P>
<P>The concepts &quot;workareas&quot;, &quot;containers&quot; and &quot;configurations&quot; are new in Oracle
Designer 6i. In addition there are new system repository access rights for subordinate repository users. Therefore
users and access rights are not migrated via the migration wizard. Subordinate users can be maintained in the Repository
Administration Utility.</P>
<P>The following subjects are covered in this chapter:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Classification of users in user groups
	<LI>Access rights per user group per repository, workarea, container and configuration
	<LI>A description of the Oracle Designer 6i repository system access rights
	<LI>Database access rights&nbsp; for subordinate users
	<LI>Provided migration user scripts
</UL>

<P><I>The system repository access rights, specific access rights to the GLOBAL_SHARED_WORKAREA and container access
rights are also valid in a non-versioned world.&nbsp; The configuration access rights are only meaningful in a
versioned world</I></P>
<H2><A NAME="Classification%20of%20user%20groups%20an"></A>Classification of user groups and subsequent access
rights</H2>
<P>The table presented below combines the following dimensions:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Configuration Management Role (e.g. Developer, DBA)
	<LI>Tasks per role - in a specific environment (e.g. development, test, production)
	<LI>Access right per workarea, container and configuration
</UL>

<P>These user groups or roles may typically be represented in your organization to develop and deploy your (Oracle)
applications. Obviously one specific user could be associated with one or more user groups. Typically you could
reuse your access guidelines based on your user group classification.</P>

<P>The access rights against workareas, containers and even configurations can be (re)defined simultaneously -
via a discontinuous select - as illustrated below.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image076.gif" WIDTH="447" HEIGHT="216" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1068"></P>
<P>You can launch the above screen by first performing a discontinuous select of the workareas, containers and
configurations , subsequently choosing the grant access rights option - available on the file menu and define the
access rights for one or more users simultaneously.</P>
<P>Note that you have to set access rights for each root container <I>and</I> its sub-container(s). The container
grant access rights utility has therefore an option, called Recurse Sub-Containers, to set the same access rights
for all sub-containers.</P>
<P>Note also that the final access rights for a specific object (e.g. insert, select, delete or update of an entity,
a table or a module) are determined by an evaluation of both the access rights against the workarea and the container(s).
For example if an Oracle Designer 6i repository user has select rights on the container HST and select, insert,
update, delete and version on the WA_DEV_HSD workarea, in the end he or she can only select any object within the
container HST (despite his or her extended access rights against the workarea).</P>
<H2><A NAME="System%20repository%20access%20rights"></A>System repository access rights</H2>
<P>The system repository access rights are significantly changed. You can define the following system repository
access rights for a specific user:</P>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>Note that the following system repository access rights are applicable only in a versioned world: Containers,
Users, Dependencies, Registration, Force, Repository Object Navigator, Repository Administration Utility, Matrix
Diagrammer, Reporting Tool and Command Line Interface.</P>
<P>You could create another table that combines the above access rights and the earlier presented roles: system
repository access rights per role.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Database%20system%20privileges"></A>Database system privileges</H2>
<P>Any subordinate user - no matter what repository role - only needs the following system privileges on the repository
database instance:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Create Session
	<LI>Alter Session
</UL>

<P>With above database system privileges any subordinate user can access all Designer 6<I>i</I> tools and diagrammers
and populate the repository with (new) elements.</P>
<H2><A NAME="User%20migration%20scripts"></A>User migration scripts</H2>
<P>Oracle Designer 6i comes with two dynamic scripts that may support the user migration:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>ckgenusr.sql&nbsp; - This sql script create database user script.
	<LI>ckgenprv.sql&nbsp; - This sql script sets a default set of the system repository access rights per user.
</UL>

<P>You can find both scripts in the &lt;oracle_home&gt;\repadm61\utl directory. These scripts must be executed
in the source repository database instance while the results must be executed in the target repository database
instance.</P>
<P>It should be clear that - after execution in the target repository - you need to revise the system repository
access rights for each user - depending on his/here role. Subsequently you must define the access rights per workarea,
container and configurations - based upon&nbsp; the classification presented above. The ckgenprv.sql script does
set these latter access rights since they are new in Oracle Designer 6i. Note also that both scripts may bring
forward obsolete users - users that were not removed in the source repository.</P>
<H1><A NAME="Chapter%208%20Synchronize%20the%20file%20s"></A>Chapter 8 Synchronize the file system and the database
with the repository content</H1>
<P>In the previous steps you have populated and reorganized the repository and you have made it accessible in a
controlled way to subordinate users. A significant part of your repository content will ultimately populate your
databases and file systems. This chapter will discuss the options available to synchronize the file systems and
the databases with the repository content (see the illustration below). These synchronization options allow you
to adopt model-based development and deployment during the complete lifecycle. You can effectively utilize the
repository content as a reference model for all your promotion environments. You are able to rebuild your file
system and database in each environment on any specific moment. Moreover you will have a variety of impact analysis
tools available to solve the issues effectively in any environment since you can use any diagrammer and the dependency
analyzer in the context of any workarea.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image078.gif" WIDTH="356" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1069"></P>
<P>Both synchronizations will be discussed in detail in the following sections.</P>
<P><I>Effectively you can only synchronize the file system and database in the development environment (via the
GLOBAL_SHARED_WORKAREA) if you have not yet entered the versioned world. Since you only have one object version
available</I>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="File%20system%20synchronization"></A>File system synchronization</H2>
<P>Each promotion environment for a specific application can be represented on the file system by a specific root
directory. For example the test environment for container HST can be represented by the directory f:\oap\hst\tst.
At the same time the directory f:\oap\hst\prd represents the production environment of HST. This allows you to
test the form HSD0002F version 2.0 without interference of version 1.0 of HSD0002f in production - captured somewhere
below f:\oap\hst\prd.</P>
<P>The synchronization of the file system with the repository content for each promotion environment is based upon
the folder mapping option.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image080.gif" WIDTH="385" HEIGHT="313" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Folder mapping" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1070"></P>
<P>You are able to apply a different folder mapping for each workarea. Remember that each workarea was representing
a specific promotion environment. For example the folder mapping for container HST in the development environment
- within workarea WA_DEV_HSD - can de defined as f:\oap\hst\dev. While the folder mapping for container HST in
the test environment - within workarea WA_TST_HSD - can de defined as f:\oap\hst\tst.</P>
<P>Once you have established the folder mappings for each container in each workarea you can use the download option
to actually synchronize the repository content with the file system. The download option extracts all files from
the repository and copies these files to the file system (illustrated below).</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image082.gif" WIDTH="449" HEIGHT="206" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1071"></P>
<P>Note that the download option not only synchronizes the current directory but also all recursive directories.</P>
<P>Remember that most workareas (except the development workarea) were based upon one or more configurations. Each
workarea content change - as a result of configuration membership changes - should therefore be succeeded by a
synchronization step on the corresponding file system to keep the repository content in sync with the file system.</P>
<H3><A NAME="File%20synchronization%20options"></A>File synchronization options</H3>
<P>Oracle Designer 6i has implemented the following options to communicate with the file system and the repository
in the context of files.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Upload
	<LI>Download
	<LI>Synchronize
	<LI>Check-in
</UL>

<P>The meaning of these file options will be explained in detail in the following sections.
<H4><A NAME="Upload"></A>Upload</H4>
<P>The upload option allows you to store files and/or folders in the repository from a specific operating system
path - either based upon the default folder mapping or session specific value.</P>
<P>Note that the upload option was used during the migration to populate the repository initially with files.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Download"></A>Download</H4>
<P>The download option allows you to publish files and/or folders from the repository from a specific folder path
on the operating system in a specific operating system path - either based upon the default folder mapping or session
specific value.</P>
<P>Note that the download option can be used to synchronize the repository content with the file system.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Synchronize"></A>Synchronize</H4>
<P>The synchronize option updates files in the repository with the contents of the corresponding files in a mapped
file system or vice versa, depending on which is the later version.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Check-in"></A>Check-in</H4>
<P>The check-in option versions the - uploaded - file, i.e. the file is already stored in the repository and in
addition it will be populated with version information.</P>
<P>Note that the check-in action is only applicable in a versioned repository.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Database%20synchronization"></A>Database synchronization</H2>
<P>Each promotion environment for a specific application can (preferably) be represented via a database schema
in a separate database instance. For example the database objects in the test environment for container HST in
workarea WA_TST_HSD can be represented by a schema owner HST_OWNER in a specific database instance called HSTTEST.
At the same time the database schema HST_OWNER in database instance HSTPROD can represent the database objects
in the production environment of HST in workarea WA_PRD_HSD in the another database instance. This allows you to
test table HSD_PROJECTS version 2.0 in the test database instance without interference of version 1.0 of HSD_PROJECTS
in production - captured in a production database instance - against the HST_OWNER schema owner.</P>
<P>The synchronization of the database with the repository content for each promotion environment can be implemented
via the DDL generator or even the DDL generator in batch - in the context of a specific workarea. Note that the
DDL generator not only generates create database objects scripts but also reconcile scripts or &quot;database delta
scripts&quot; if you generate against a schema that already contains all or part of the application database objects.
Further note that Oracle 8<I>i</I> supports the &quot;alter table drop column&quot; statement. The database synchronization
in each database instance can therefore be supported to a great extent with the DDL generators in each workarea,
which makes it very attractive to adopt this promotion model.</P>
<P>The proposed promotion implementation model also supports the handling of database objects. For example a developer
may have write access on the container HST. At the same time he will probably have only read access to workarea
WA_PRD and only read access to schema HST_OWNER in the production database. He/she will therefore never be able
to change the database structure in the production environment.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image084.gif" WIDTH="387" HEIGHT="386" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1072"></P>
<P>Above screenshot shows the DDL generator in the context of workarea WA_TST_HSD for the schema owner HST_OWNER
in a test database instance - via HSTTEST connect string. Note that you can run the DDL generator for all database
objects as well as a sub-selection.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Synchronization%20add-ons"></A>Synchronization add-ons</H2>
<P>Both synchronizations (repository content versus file system and repository content versus database) can be
verified with the following add-ons, Keyword Expansion kit and CheckRelease:</P>
<P><B>Keyword Expansion Kit<BR>
</B>Keyword Expansion refers to functionality that acts upon objects that are being checked into the repository.
The keyword expansion utility will look for keywords in the checked in object. Supported keywords are expanded
or replaced with actual values of check-in parameters, such as author, version label, date and check-in notes.
This is functionality very common to most Source Code Control tools and in high demand under our customers. It
allows for complete identification of files downloaded from the repository: through keyword expansion, every file
can and should always contain the appropriate Version Label assigned in the repository.</P>
<P><B>CheckRelease</B><BR>
The CheckRelease utility comprises a GUI (Oracle Forms Module) that allows you to confront the content of one or
more application systems (e.g. tables, views, files) in the context of a workarea with a build of these application
systems on a file system and database. It uses therefore one or more intermediate release tables that are populated
with repository information like the name, type and version number of the repository objects. This release table
content represents what should be built on the file system and database in a specific environment.</P>
<P>Both add-ons are available via the Supplement Option. Visit www.otn.oracle.com for more information about the
Supplement Option (e.g. What it is, pricing and conditions).</P>
<H1><A NAME="Chapter%209%20A%20typical%20migration%20pl"></A>Chapter 9 A typical migration plan</H1>
<P>The previous chapters have given a technical insight in the migration efforts - represented by the blue Migration
square (the task before Roll-out) in the sheet below. As you can see in the sheet below there are many more tasks
to fulfill to finish a Oracle Designer 6i migration project successfully. This chapter will give an overview of
these other migration tasks,&nbsp; their characteristics and their dependencies:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image086.gif" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="360" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1073"></P>
<P>The introduction of Oracle Designer 6i in your organization can effectively be organized via the following phases:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Preparation
	<LI>Trial migration
	<LI>Hardware and software upgrades Win32 clients
	<LI>Hardware and software upgrades DBMS server
	<LI>Hardware and software upgrades middle-tier
	<LI>Redesign Configuration Management (CM) tasks and responsibilities
	<LI>Redesign (CM) procedures and standards &amp; guidelines
	<LI>CM and Oracle Designer 6i training
	<LI>Migration
	<LI>Rollout
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Preparation"></A>Preparation</H2>
<P>The preparation stage should deliver your migration plan.&nbsp; Such a plan should cover the following decisions:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Big bang migration of structured elements or a stepwise migration
	<LI>Bring in files in the repository as well?
	<LI>Introduction Oracle8i/ Oracle9i functionality
	<LI>Migration strategy for database objects, Oracle Developer components and Web PL/SQL modules as described in
	Parts 3, 4 and 5
	<LI>Migration or implementation of business rules
	<LI>Scope of migration in the Configuration Management area
	<LI>Redistribution of tasks as a result of a different way and writing method
</UL>

<P>It should also comprise:

<UL>
	<LI>Opportunities, Objectives &amp; Scope
	<LI>A detailed task overview with resource usages
	<LI>Project organization
	<LI>Costs and benefits
</UL>

<P>Note that a detailed task overview can be based on the overall tasks presented above.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Trial%20migration"></A>Trial migration</H2>
<P>A trial migration can be planned on separate hardware platforms - client,&nbsp; middletier and server - to evaluate
the repository size and performance aspects. In addition you can&nbsp; reuse the trial migration environment for
educational purposes, to develop your set of configuration management procedures and standards &amp; guidelines
and&nbsp; it can provide effective output for the subsequent hardware and software installation tasks on the client,
middle-tier and server platforms.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Hardware%20and%20software%20upgrades%20W"></A>Hardware and software upgrades Win32 clients</H2>
<P>Your current clients (Windows 98/NT/2000/XP) may not be sufficient in terms of disk space, processing capacity
and memory to run the Oracle Designer 6i software <A NAME="2-4"></A>and subsequent components like Developer 6<I>i</I>.
A hardware and software upgrade may take some time, specifically if you have a significant number of win32 clients.&nbsp;
In addition you can prepare the automation of the software distribution of the Oracle Designer 6i tool stack via
for example the Novell Application Launcher or other client distribution tools like SMS.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Hardware%20and%20software%20upgrades%20D"></A>Hardware and software upgrades DBMS server</H2>
<P>The hardware and software upgrade of the database server covers - at least - the database instance for the Oracle
Designer 6i repository. It could also cover the upgrade of the databases that capture your applications.</P>

<P><A NAME="2-5"></A>Designer 6i release 4.2 is certified with 81700 or higher and Oracle9i patched to 9.0.1.2.
<FONT COLOR="red"> </FONT>Note that a database upgrade can also implicate an upgrade of the operating system. Therefore
not only the DBA department but also the department that manages server platforms must be involved.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Hardware%20and%20software%20upgrades%20m"></A>Hardware and software upgrades middle-tier</H2>
<P>Future releases of Oracle Developer 6i - part of the Oracle Internet Development Suite (iDS) - will no longer
support a client/server architecture. It is therefore highly recommended that you introduce or update your middle-tier
platform with new software components - or an upgrade - to Oracle 9iAS. In addition to hardware upgrade issues,
it may also involve a new version of the underlying operating system.&nbsp; In addition - specifically if you introduce
a middle-tier - you must deal with management (support) and knowledge transfer of the middle-tier software. In
practice, this stage and the organizational impact proves to be the most underestimated. <FONT COLOR="red"></FONT></P>
<H2><A NAME="Redesign%20Configuration%20Managemen"></A>Redesign Configuration Management (CM) tasks and responsibilities</H2>
<P>The introduction of Oracle Designer 6i and the underlying repository brings along a new writing and working
method for a wide range of participants since the repository will be used for development as well as deployment.
Your big challenge is to cover all the tasks (see also the matrices for application life cycle tasks and tool stack
maintenance tasks presented in Chapter 7 &quot;Migrate users and assign access rights&quot;) in your specific organization.
This stage is perhaps the most challenging one of your entire migration project - so do not underestimate it.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Redesign%20(CM)%20procedures%20and%20sta"></A>Redesign (CM) procedures and standards &amp; guidelines</H2>
<P>As soon as the redistribution of tasks and responsibilities is well under way you can start with the production
of the redesign of Configuration Management procedures and Standards &amp; Guidelines.</P>
<P>You could try to produce a big fat configuration management handbook - that most likely at the end of the day
will only be consulted by you. You could also try to adopt a “less is more approach”, i.e. produce multiple Quick
Reference Cards that cover for example your CM procedures, CM Standard &amp; Guidelines and tool support. You could
think of Quick Reference Cards candidates:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Repository Terminology
	<LI>Check-in and Check-out Quick Reference Card
	<LI>Overview of Designer/Repository Tools
	<LI>Naming Standards (workareas, configurations, ddl scripts)
	<LI>Database synchronization and DDL generation guidelines
	<LI>Guidelines for the usage of the Database Design Transformer
	<LI>Management of Repository Access rights
	<LI>Setup of a parallel environment
	<LI>Setup of a bug-fix environment
</UL>

<P>A few examples of the above listed Quick Reference Cards are presented in <A HREF="mg_appendix-b_6i-2.htm">Appendix
B</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="CM%20and%20Designer%209i%20training"></A>CM and Oracle Designer 6i training</H2>
<P>An effective and productive migration and subsequently the effective usage of the Oracle Designer 6i&nbsp;tool
stack and subsequent CM procedures relies heavily on well trained participants. By now it should be clear that
not only developers need training but also other participants like project configuration managers, application
support representatives and the security department that provides access to the repository.</P>
<P>An effective CM and Oracle Designer 6i training plan therefore should be based on the profiles or roles as covered
in the matrices presented earlier. Therefore you cannot start the training task before the first results of the
re-distribution task are available. Subsequently you should evaluate for each profile the need to cover one or
more of the following training subjects:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i new database features
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i Forms and Reports generation new features
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i WEB PL/SQL modules new features
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i new Configuration Management features
	<LI>Business Rule implementation via CDMRule Frame
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i Forms and Reports generation<FONT COLOR="red"> <A NAME="2-7"></A></FONT>via Headstart 6<I>i</I>
	<LI>Knowlegde transfer of one or more custom Configuration Management procedures - perhaps captured in the Quick
	Reference Cards
	<LI>Subsequently you can fill in the identified training needs per profile with a combination of standard available
	courses and/or custom courses.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Migration"></A>Migration</H2>
<P>The technical migration aspects are already discusses in detail in the previous chapters of this part (Part
2). In addition more specific migration details on an object-type-by-object-type-basis will be provided in Parts
3, 4 and 5.&nbsp; The migration task can only start - as will be pointed out below - with skilled developers. Your
migration start date is therefore not only dependent of the hardware/software availability, but also on a skilled
staff that can perform one or migration activities.</P>
<P>The coherence between these different migration steps of&nbsp; structured elements and files in the different
source repositories and Oracle Designer 6i repository and the inevitable parallel development as a result of these
migration steps can be visualized as follows:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/image088.gif" WIDTH="595" HEIGHT="446" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" v:shapes="_x0000_i1074"> &nbsp;</P>
<P>From top till bottom the following repositories are depicted:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>PVCS/VM source repository for files - could also be another third party source control
	<LI>Designer 1.3.2 repository - source repository
	<LI>Designer 6.0 repository - intermediate repository
	<LI>Oracle Designer 6i repository - target repository
</UL>

<P>From left to right a time period is depicted - somewhere between 1 week and 3 months depending on the size,
number and complexity of the application systems and/or projects and not in&nbsp; the least on the specific migration
scenarios for the specific object types - as discussed in Parts&nbsp; 3, 4 and 5.</P>
<P>To explain the parallel development challenge you should start at the lower left corner in the Designer 1.3.2
repository and the third party repository (e.g. PVCS/VM repository) with a clean-up (<I>depicted by the purple
arrows</I>).</P>
<P>Parallel with the clean-up stage you can start with a fresh installation of Designer 6.0 - to capture intermediate
application systems - and Oracle Designer 6i - to capture the target application systems and files (<I>depicted
by the dark green arrows)</I>. If your application systems live already in Designer 6.0 you should replace all
references to Designer 1.3.2 with Designer 6.0 and you can skip the fresh installation of Designer 6.0. After the
clean-up you export a coherent set of application systems into the intermediate Designer 6.0 repository (<I>depicted
by the lower vertical red&nbsp; arrow</I>). At the same time you import this set back in the Designer 1.3.2 repository
under different application names. This set will be used as a snapshot of your migration start.</P>
<P>Developers can continue with their work in Designer 1.3.2 although you should not encourage them to apply a
lot of changes, since these changes are by definition not captured in the imported set.&nbsp; In the intermediate
Designer 6.0 repository, clean-up activities like re-connect share links can be picked up (<I>depicted by the upper
purple arrow</I>). As soon as these cleanup activities are finished you can launch the migration wizard in Oracle
Designer 6i, connect to the Designer 6.0 repository and make the selection (<I>depicted by the upper vertical red&nbsp;
arrow</I>). The migration wizard will bring the application set forward in the Oracle Designer 6i repository. Subsequently
you can freeze the application systems in Designer 6.0 (<I>depicted by the yellow arrow</I>) and start with a check-in
of the structured elements in Oracle Designer 6i - to capture the fresh migration result (<I>depicted by the light
green arrows</I>). You could also leave them un-versioned and apply your migration scenarios for database objects
as described in Part 3.</P>
<P>While one or more of your developers is executing the database migration scenario you can start with the upload
of files on a project-by-project basis from the PVCS/VM repository as described in Chapter 4 (<I>depicted by the
right&nbsp; upper - solid and dotted - vertical red&nbsp; arrows</I>). You can close down each PVCS/VM project
as soon as the files are uploaded in the Oracle Designer 6i repository (<I>depicted by the dotted yellow arrows</I>).
The parallel development time for files can be very short - less than a day - since you do not have to verify the
generation capability as with structured elements.&nbsp;</P>
<P>While the files from one or more PVCS/VM projects (or file system) are uploaded you should focus on finishing
the migration steps for database objects as described in Chapters 3 and 4 of Part 3 (<I>depicted by the right light
green arrow - verify database objects</I>). By now you should have reached the reorganization phase in your target
Oracle Designer 6i repository. In this phase you will organize your repository in one or more development workareas
- containing the migrated application systems and files - and you will bring forward your subordinate users with
the appropriate access rights, see also Chapter 7 (<I>depicted by the right light green arrow</I>). With more subordinate
users - developers - you can start effectively with the migration scenarios for Development components and WEB
PL/SQL modules as described in Parts 4 and 5. In addition you may want to apply one of the database new features
migration steps as described in Chapter 5 of Part 3 (<I>depicted by the brown&nbsp; arrow</I>).</P>
<P>While applying these migration steps in the target repository you will also bring forward all the changes from
the source repository since the start of the migration. You could use the snapshot very effectively to narrow down
the exact changes since the start of the migration. As soon as you have brought forward the source repository changes
- manually - in the target repository you can close down the source repository application system (<I>depicted
by the dotted blue arrow</I>). The real challenge here is to close down the source repository application systems
as quickly as possible or to phrase it differently to minimize the parallel development period. Note that you must
bring forward more changes with a longer parallel development period. You can accomplish a short period by basically
bringing in as much “qualified” resources as you can to execute the migration scenarios of Parts 3, 4 and 5.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Rollout"></A>Rollout</H2>
<P>Finally - after finishing the migration of structured elements and files as described in Part 2 and after finishing
the migration scenarios of Parts 3, 4 and 5 - you can roll out Oracle Designer 6i to all participants that are
involved in development and deployment. Basically you are offering on-site support during first time Oracle Designer
6i use by all participants during this phase. The support activities must elaborate on the training effort. They
should definitely not replace the training courses.&nbsp; It turns out that the acceptance and effective usage
of Oracle Designer 6i will speed up significantly if you can find enthusiastic and skilled representatives in each
department. These early adopters in each department can&nbsp; soon take over the support task and take care of
wide effective usage of the Oracle Designer 6i tool.</P>
