<h2>
    Classes in the Example Program
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The <a href=http://docs.rinet.ru/OLDui/OLDui/overview/example/Converter.java>example program</a>
defines two classes
that inherit from AWT classes.
It also defines a data storing class.
However, most of the objects in the program
are instances of AWT classes.

<p>

The following snapshot shows the example program's GUI.
Each visible feature is labelled
with the class that implements the feature.
For example, the Converter class
implements the object that draws
the external box,
and which contains every component in the program's GUI.
The Converter class also happens to implement many features
that aren't visible in the snapshot,
such as the <code>main()</code> method
that allows the program to run as an application.

This page tells you about every object the program creates.
Don't worry -- we don't expect you to understand everything yet.
We just want to convey to you the kinds of objects
a GUI program might use.


<h4>Classes Defined in the Example Program</h4>
<blockquote>
The example program defines two Panel subclasses,
Converter and ConversionPanel,
and a simple class named Unit.
<p>

The Converter class is the heart of the example program.
It contains the program's <code>main()</code> method
(which is called if the program is run as an application),
as well as initialization and startup code,
which is called either by the <code>main()</code> method 
or by the application that loads that program as an applet.
The Converter class actually extends the Applet class
(which itself extends Panel),
instead of directly extending Panel.
This is necessary because all applets must contain an Applet subclass.
However, since the example program can also run as an application,
the Converter class must not use any functionality
provided by the Applet class.
In other words, the Converter class
must be implemented as if it extended Panel.

<p>

The ConversionPanel class
provides a way of grouping all the controls
that describe a particular set of distance measurements.
The example program creates two ConversionPanel objects,
one for metric distance measurements,
and the other for U.S. distance measurements.

<p>

The Unit class provides objects that
group a description
(such as "Centimeters")
with a multiplier that indicates the number of units per meter
(0.01, for example).


</blockquote>
<h4>AWT Objects in the Example Program</h4>
<blockquote>

The example program uses several LayoutManagers, Containers, and Components
provided by the AWT package.
It also creates two Insets objects
and two GridBagConstraints objects.

<p>

The example program creates three objects
that conform to the LayoutManager interface:
a GridLayout and two GridBagLayouts.
The GridLayout manages the layout of the Components
in the Converter instance.
Each ConversionPanel uses a GridBagLayout object
to manage its Components,
and a GridBagConstraints object
to specify how to lay out each Component.

<p>

Besides the Converter and ConversionPanel objects,
the example program can create one more Container.
Specifically, if the program is run as an application
(instead of as an applet),
then it creates a Frame instance (an independent window).
<p>

All the non-container components
in the example program
are created by ConversionPanel.
Each ConversionPanel contains one instance each
of the AWT Label, Choice, TextField, and Scrollbar classes.

<p>

Both the Converter and the ConversionPanel classes create
Insets instances
that specify the padding that should appear
around their onscreen representations.
