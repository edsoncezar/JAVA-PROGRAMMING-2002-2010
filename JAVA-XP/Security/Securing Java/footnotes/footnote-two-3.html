<sup>3</sup> In Chapter 5, we address this "dual nature" of the security model. Is it true that the Verifier allows only what the compiler allows? Or is the set of things that byte code can do larger than the set of things that should be possible to do in Java? The latter seems to be the case. In fact, we know of at least one instance in which it is possible to do something in byte code that it is not possible to do in Java source.
