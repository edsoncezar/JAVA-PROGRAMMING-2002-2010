<sup>2</sup> Java has some competition as an environment for creating executable content. Other languages with a similar bent are JavaScript, Safe-Tcl, Telescript, Word macros, Excel macros, ActiveX, and Postscript. Many of the security lessons in this book apply to those languages as well. Later in this chapter we will examine ActiveX security issues more closely.
