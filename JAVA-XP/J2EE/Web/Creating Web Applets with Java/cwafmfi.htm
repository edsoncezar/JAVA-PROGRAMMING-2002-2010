<BR></FONT></A></CENTER></H3>

<P>The question, &#147;What is Java?&#148; often only leads to more questions. Some people see Java as yet another bit of Internet hype. Others see Java as the future of the Internet and Internet applications. In truth, Java probably lies somewhere in 
between the extremes.

<BR></P>

<P>We hope that this book will begin to show you what Java is and what Java is not. Java is new, and Java is exciting. But Java is not the solution to every computing problem. Java is, quite simply, a new object-oriented programming language. With it comes 

the advantages of object-oriented programming and several other advantages that have been created through Java&#146;s development process.

<BR></P>

<P>Java has been presented in many different ways by many different interests, but at the heart of all the Java hype is the language itself. Many people are confused or scared about what using Java means. What we hope to accomplish with this book is to 
provide you with some answers.

<BR></P>

<P>Part I takes a first look at Java. You&#146;ll see where Java has been and where it&#146;s headed. You&#146;ll also take a look at what Java is capable of and hopefully you&#146;ll finish these chapters as excited about Java as we are.

<BR></P>

<P>Part II approaches Java from a user&#146;s standpoint. How do you view Java applets and applications? What are the limits of what Java can do? What are the real-world uses for Java, and when is Java not enough?

<BR></P>

<P>Part III discusses how you can start using Java applets in your own Web development projects. You'll learn where to find Java applets, how to add those applets to your Web pages, and how to customize them.

<BR></P>

<P>Once you&#146;ve seen what Java can do and have started adding Java to your pages, Parts 4 and 5 will teach you more about the language and take you through the basics of programming your own applets.

<BR></P>

<P>Finally, Chapters 12 and 13 provide you with some real-world applet examples. You can see the development of two working applets from beginning to end. Use this part as a starting point for developing your own applets and as a general guide for 
programming.
