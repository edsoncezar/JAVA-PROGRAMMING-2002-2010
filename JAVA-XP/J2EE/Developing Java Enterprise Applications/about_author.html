<P>First, we would both like to thank the PRI gang; Alberto, Brad, Eric, Ethan, Glen, John, Karen, Kerry, Nicole, Shrinand, and Tyler. Sometimes writing takes away from work and we appreciate their dedication in our stead. Special thanks to Ethan for his LDAP expertise and Alberto for listening to Stephen complain about another late night, a fouled up example, or basically anything worth commiserating about.
</P>
<P>And where would authors be without editors? Many thanks to Terri Hudson, Kathryn Malm, and Gerrie Cho for transforming our sometimes confused expositions into logical explanations.</P>
<P>Finally, unending thanks to our wives Cheryl and Susan. You can only apologize for coming to bed at 3 a.m. and working through the weekend so many times before you realize that the person you keep apologizing to knew long before you did what your decision to write a book entailed. I know from my experience that Cheryl is always two or more steps ahead of me, and although I kick myself for not figuring it out sooner, I wouldn&#146;t have it any other way. I bet if you asked Scott about Sue, he would tell you the same thing.</P>
