<P>So why are there two kinds of session beans? Certainly, as seen from the example, there is a need for stateful beans, but why does the specification define stateless beans? To answer this question, let&#146;s look at the pros and cons of each type of session bean.
</P>
<P>Stateful beans will save state for a client. This allows the client to create a relationship with the bean and expect the bean to remember changes made by earlier messages. However, because stateful beans save information, they must be created for each client, which takes up system resources. Stateless beans don&#146;t use a lot of resources because they are associated with a client only on a message basis. This means that a client may talk to several different beans throughout its relationship with the server and cannot rely on a particular method to know what has happened previously. These pros and cons are summarized in Table 16.5.</P>
<P>Next, let&#146;s create some entity beans.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading24"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Creating an Entity Bean</FONT></H3>
<P>Entity beans are part of the EJB 1.0 specification, but they are not required for 1.0 hosts. According to Sun, entity beans will be required in the 2.0 specification. The BEA WebLogic server was chosen for the examples because it already implements entity beans, allowing us to show working examples here.
</P>
<P>An entity bean represents an actual business entity. For example, an entity might represent a client&#146;s shopping cart or a check request. Regardless of their purpose, all entity beans share a common property: They are persistent. When we say they are persistent, we mean that the data represented by the bean will persist, even if the bean is not currently in the server&#146;s memory.</P>

<P>Persistence can be implemented in numerous ways. For example, you can use a relational database or object serialization. However, you are not limited to just these two examples.
</P>
<P>To maximize flexibility, the EJB specification defines two types of persistent beans: those that manage their own data and those that rely on the container to manage their data. Because entity beans are not required for 1.0 hosts, you may find some providers that support only one type of persistence. Ultimately, everyone should provide both.</P>
<P>Container persistence is an interesting concept. Basically, you tell the container how to map your objects onto a persistent store. This store depends on the EJB host. For example, BEA WebLogic supports JDBC mappings as well as object serialization. BEA WebLogic has also said that it will soon support custom container-managed persistence. A database vendor that supports enterprise beans might provide optimized mapping to the database for container-managed entity beans.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Beans that use one type of persistence may not be able to make use of other persistence mechanisms. In particular, the current version of BEAWebLogic&#146;s server does not allow beans using file-based container managed persistence to access JDBC databases, because of the different transaction semantics between these storage devices. Future releases should ease this limitation. Be sure to read the documentation on your specific host to determine its support for container-managed beans.</FONT><HR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Beans that manage their persistence themselves rely on the container to notify them that it is time to save or time to reload data. At that point, the bean must get the data or store it. For example, the bean might execute JDBC commands or serialize its data to a file. The key difference is that the bean manages the specifics of the process, not the container.
</P>
<P>All entity beans, regardless of their persistence mechanism, are required to implement the EntityBean interface. The EntityBean interface is similar to the SessionBean interface but adds a few new methods and semantics. All of these methods are listed in Table 16.6.</P>
<P>From these methods, it becomes clear that the main difference between entity and session beans is that the entity bean manages data that must be synchronized with an underlying store and that the bean is perhaps longer lasting, so it needs to be notified when it is no longer in use. Because an entity bean may be in memory for an extended period of time, the load and save methods may be called more than once on the same bean. This could represent triggers going off in a database, telling the container to update the bean because the underlying data has changed.</P>
<P>Another difference that isn&#146;t clear from these methods is that entity beans are intended to uniquely, or almost uniquely, represent a specific item. This means that if multiple clients are accessing the same checking account, they will probably be accessing the same checking-account entity bean. In other words, the bean may be accessed from multiple clients. However, the EJB host should allow you to force the bean to be accessed by one client at a time during deployment.</P>
