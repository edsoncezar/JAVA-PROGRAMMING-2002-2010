  status in February 2000. The long march towards the promised land of
  1.0'ness was not taken lightly. JBoss 1.0 established itself as a
  technological leader with many ease of use features pioneered here
  before finding their way to the broader audience of commercial
  container developers.  Mostly thanks to Rickard Oberg, the design
  of 1.0 introduced many standard setting features such
  as Proxy based deployment and distributed containers.</p><p>Marc Fleury had been working for almost 6 months on a traditional,
  compilation heavy approach to the container design, when Rickard came
  along with the logical skeletons and the dynamic proxies as the basis
  for a radically new design. Marc started coding feverishly and codenamed
  the container "NextGen" truly believing it was a blueprint of things to
  come, a "next generation" container.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="d0e7836"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e7836"></a>JBoss 2.0</h3></div></div><p>JBoss 2.0 that we are about to explore is truly a 3rd generation
  container. It takes the patterns and ideas that were investigated in
  1.0 and then does it right. Designed from the ground up to be modular,
  JBoss introduces yet again many ground breaking features, such as
  automated re-deploy, but most importantly a plug-in approach to
  container implementation. Borrowing from the success that met with
  Linux 2.0 and a it's modular approach to Open Source software
  implementation, JBoss 2.0 is meant to be developed by distributed
  parties each working on a cleanly separated part of the server.</p><p>JBoss 2.0 also standardizes on JMX, the Java Management eXtension
  (TM) to offer standard interfaces to the management of its components
  as well as the applications deployed on it. Ease of use is still the
  number one priority here at JBoss, and JBoss 2.0 will set a new
  standard.</p><p>We have to admit that it was hard to decide where to begin and how
  to proceed on this journey through JBoss. Although it's architecture is
  clean, modular, and a mecca of best programming practices we know of,
  the inhereted complexity of a distributed system carries it's weight.</p><p>In order to understand how JBoss 2.0 works one could go many ways.
  The approach we chose could be loosely described as "follow the call".
  We'll not dwelve into container architecture directly, but in contrast
  will build the foundation first on understanding client object structures,
  how they pass the call to container over the network layer. Finally,
  before we discuss container architecture in detail, we'll focus on
  the container entry point.</p><p> With regard to container architecture, we'll explore all the
  slices from the container entry point to database access structures,
  focusing on various patterns, the renowned container plugin-in approach,
  and how they relate to key points in EJB in general. </p><p>Now, let's not spoil all the fun parts.
  Put your helmets on, we are going straight to the trenches!!!</p></div></div></div><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" height="65"><tr height="65"><td rowspan="2"><img src="images\gbar.gif" width="432" height="79"></td><td rowspan="2" background="images\gbar.gif" width="100%" align="right" valign="top"><a href="index.html"><img src="images\doc.gif" border="0"></a><a href="index.html"><img src="images\toc.gif" border="0"></a><a href="ch11s11.html"><img src="images\prev.gif" border="0"></a><a href="ch12s04.html"><img src="images\next.gif" border="0"></a></td></tr><tr></tr></table></body></html>
