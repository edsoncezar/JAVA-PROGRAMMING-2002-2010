Java Management Extensions Setup Instructions (MS Windows)

1. Download and unzip the jmxapp.zip file.

2. Download and install the JMX Reference Implementation. Currently this is available at http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement.

3. Download and install Jakarta Ant. Currently this is available at http://jakarta.apache.org/ant.

4. Edit the batch file you want to run and change the following @set statements to reflect the locations of your JDK, JMX RI and Ant installation directories:

@set JAVA_HOME=c:\jdk1.3.1
@set JMX_HOME=c:\jmx1.0.1
@set ANT_HOME=c:\ant1.4

In this example (which is what is in each batch file, by the way), the JDK is installed at c:\jdk1.3.1, the JMX RI is installed at c:\jmx1.0.1 and Ant is installed at c:\ant1.4. You will need to change these lines in *every* batch file to reflect your particular setup.


NOTE: in order for the open MBeans code to compile, you will need to install the JMX Maintenance Release RI (a.k.a., JMX 1.1), also currently available at http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement.
