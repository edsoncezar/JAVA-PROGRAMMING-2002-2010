<P>
Hash and Scatter tables have many applications.
The principal characteristic of such applications
is that keyed information needs to be frequently accessed
and the access pattern is either unknown or known to be random.
For example, hash tables are often used to implement the
<em>symbol table</em><A NAME=13786>&#160;</A> of a programming language compiler.
A symbol table is used to keep track of information associated
with the symbols (variable and method names) used by a programmer.
In this case,
the keys are character strings and each key hash associated
with it some information about the symbol
(e.g., type, address, value, lifetime, scope).
<P>
This section presents a simple application of hash and scatter tables.
Suppose we are required to count the number of occurrences of
each distinct word contained in a text file.
We can do this easily using a hash or scatter table.
Program&nbsp;<A HREF="page249.html#progAlgorithmsk"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> gives the an implementation.

<STRONG>Program:</STRONG> Hash/scatter table application--counting words.<BR>
<P>
<P>
The static inner class <tt>Counter</tt> extends
the class <tt>Int</tt> defined in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="page117.html#secadtswrappers"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
In addition to the functionality inherited from the base class,
the <tt>Counter</tt> class adds the method <tt>increment</tt>
which increments the value by one.
<P>
The <tt>wordCounter</tt> method
does the actual work of counting the words in the input file.
The local variable <tt>table</tt> refers to a <tt>ChainedHashTable</tt>
that is used to keep track of the words and counts.
The objects which are put into the hash table
are all instances of the class <tt>Association</tt>.
Each association has as its key a <tt>String</tt> class instance,
and as its value a <tt>Counter</tt> class instance.
<P>
The <tt>wordCounter</tt> method reads words from the input stream one at a time.
As each word is read,
a <tt>find</tt> operation is done on the hash table to determine
if there is already an association for the given key.
If none is found,
a new association is created an inserted into the hash table.
The given word is used as the key of the new association
and the value is a counter which is initialized to one.
On the other hand,
if there is already an association for the given word in the hash table,
the corresponding counter is incremented.
When the <tt>wordCounter</tt> method reaches the end of the input stream,
it simply prints the hash table on the given output stream.
<P>
The running time of the <tt>wordCounter</tt> method
depends on a number of factors,
including the number of different keys,
the frequency of occurrence of each key,
and the distribution of the keys in the overall space of keys.
Of course, the hash/scatter table implementation chosen
has an effect as does the size of the table used.
For a reasonable set of keys we expect the hash function
to do a good job of spreading the keys uniformly in the table.
Provided a sufficiently large table is used,
the average search and insertion time is bounded by a constant.
Under these ideal conditions the running time should be <I>O</I>(<I>n</I>),
where <I>n</I> is the number of words in the input file.
