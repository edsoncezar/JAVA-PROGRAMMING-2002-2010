<P>
This section presents the simulation of
a system comprised of a single queue and server as shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="page381.html#figqueueing"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
Program&nbsp;<A HREF="page382.html#progSimulationb"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> defines the class <tt>Event</tt>
which represents events in the simulation.
There are two parts to an event,
a <em>type</em> (either <tt>arrival</tt> or <tt>departure</tt>),
and a <em>time</em>.
<P>
<P><A NAME="27219">&#160;</A><A NAME="progSimulationb">&#160;</A> <IMG WIDTH=575 HEIGHT=371 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="program27034" SRC="img1540.gif"  ><BR>
<STRONG>Program:</STRONG> <tt>Event</tt> class.<BR>
<P>
<P>
Since events will be put into a priority queue,
the <tt>Event</tt> class is derived from the <tt>Association</tt> class
introduced in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="page127.html#secadtsassociations"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
An association is an ordered pair comprised of a key and a value.
In the case of the <tt>Event</tt> class,
the key is the <em>time</em> of the event
and the value is the <em>type</em> of the event.
Therefore, the events in a priority queue are prioritized by their times.
<P>
Program&nbsp;<A HREF="page382.html#progSimulationa"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> defines the <tt>run</tt> method
which implements the discrete event simulation.
This method takes one argument, <tt>timeLimit</tt>,
which specifies the total amount of time to be simulated.
<P>
The <tt>Simulation</tt> class contains a single field,
called <tt>eventList</tt>,
which is a priority queue.
This priority queue is used to hold the events during the course
of the simulation.

<STRONG>Program:</STRONG> Application of priority queues--discrete event simulation.<BR>
<P>
<P>
The state of the system being simulated is represented by the two
variables <tt>serverBusy</tt> and <tt>numberInQueue</tt>.
The first is a <tt>boolean</tt> value which indicates whether the server is busy.
The second keeps track of the number of customers in the queue.
<P>
In addition to the state variables,
there are two instances of the class <tt>ExponentialRV</tt>.
The class <tt>ExponentialRV</tt> is a random number generator
defined in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="page465.html#secalgsrng"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
It implements the <tt>RandomVariable</tt> interface
defined in Program&nbsp;<A HREF="page468.html#progRandomVariablea"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
This interface defines a method called <tt>nextDouble</tt>
which is used to sample the random number generator.
Every time <tt>nextDouble</tt> is called,
a different (random) result is returned.
The random values are exponentially distributed around a mean value
which is specified in the constructor.
For example, in this case both <tt>serviceTime</tt> and <tt>interArrivalTime</tt>
produce random distributions with the mean value of 100 (lines&nbsp;9-11).
<P>
It is assumed that the <tt>eventList</tt> priority queue is initially empty.
The simulation begins by enqueueing a customer arrival at time zero (line&nbsp;12).
The <tt>while</tt> loop (lines&nbsp;13-44) constitutes the main simulation loop.
This loop continues as long as the <tt>eventList</tt> is not empty,
i.e., as long as there is an event to be simulated
<P>
Each iteration of the simulation loop begins
by dequeuing the next event in the event list (line&nbsp;15).
If the time of that event exceeds <tt>timeLimit</tt>,
the event is discarded,
the <tt>eventList</tt> is purged,
and the simulation is terminated.
Otherwise, the simulation proceeds.
<P>
The simulation of an event depends on the type of that event.
The <tt>switch</tt> statement (line&nbsp;19) invokes the appropriate code
for the given event.
If the event is a customer arrival and the server is not busy,
<tt>serverBusy</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt>
and the <tt>serviceTime</tt> random number generator is sampled
to determine the amount of time required to service the customer.
A customer departure is scheduled
at the appropriate time in the future (lines&nbsp;24-26).
On the other hand, if the server is already busy when the customer arrives,
we add one to the <tt>numberInQueue</tt> variable (line&nbsp;29).
<P>
Another customer arrival is scheduled after every customer arrival.
The <tt>interArrivalTime</tt> random number generator is sampled,
and the arrival is scheduled
at the appropriate time in the future (lines&nbsp;30-31).
<P>
If the event is a customer departure and the queue is empty,
the server becomes idle (lines&nbsp;34-35).
When a customer departs and there are still customers in the queue,
the next customer in the queue is served.
Therefore, <tt>numberInQueue</tt> is decreased by one
and the <tt>serviceTime</tt> random number generator is sampled
to determine the amount of time required to service the next customer.
A customer departure is scheduled
at the appropriate time in the future (lines&nbsp;38-40).
<P>
Clearly the execution of the <tt>Simulation</tt> method
given in Program&nbsp;<A HREF="page382.html#progSimulationa"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="..\icons\cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> mimics the modeled system.
Of course, the program given produces no output.
For it to be of any practical value,
the simulation program should be instrumented
to allow the user to study its behavior.
For example, the user may be interested in knowing statistics
such as the average queue length
and the average waiting time that a customer waits for service.
And such instrumentation can be easily incorporated into the given framework.
