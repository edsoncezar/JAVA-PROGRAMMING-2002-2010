<h2><a name="1217"><i>	7.1	</i> Threads at the Java Language Level
</a></h2>

<blockquote>

Built-in support for <em>threads</em> provides Java programmers with a powerful tool to improve interactive performance of graphical applications. If your application needs to run animations and play music while scrolling the page and downloading a text file from a server, <em>multithreading</em> is the way to obtain fast, lightweight concurrency within a single process space. Threads are sometimes also called lightweight processes or execution contexts. <p>
<a name="1219"><!-- --></a>
Threads are an essential keystone of Java. The Java library provides a <kbd>Thread</kbd> class that supports a rich collection of methods to start a thread, run a thread, stop a thread, and check on a thread&#39;s status.<p>
<a name="1220"><!-- --></a>
Java thread support includes a sophisticated set of <em>synchronization primitives</em> based on the widely used <em>monitor</em> and <em>condition variable</em> paradigm introduced twenty years ago by C.A.R. Hoare and implemented in a production setting in Xerox PARC&#39;s Cedar/Mesa system. Integrating support for threads into the language makes them much easier to use and more robust. Much of the style of Java&#39;s integration of threads was modelled after Cedar and Mesa.<p>
<a name="1221"><!-- --></a>
Java&#39;s threads are <em>pre-emptive</em>, and depending on platform on which the Java interpreter executes, threads can also be <em>time-sliced</em>. On systems that don&#39;t support time-slicing, once a thread has started, the only way it will relinquish control of the processor is if another thread of a higher priority takes control of the processor. If your applications are likely to be compute-intensive, you might consider how to give up control periodically by using the <kbd>yield()</kbd> method to give other threads a chance to run; doing so will ensure better interactive response for graphical applications.<p>
