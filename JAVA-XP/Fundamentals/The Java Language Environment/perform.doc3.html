</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="2452"><!-- --></a>
Very dynamic languages like Lisp, TCL, and SmallTalk are often used for <em>prototyping</em>. One of the reasons for their success at this is that they are very robust&#45;&#45;you don&#39;t have to worry about freeing or corrupting memory.<p>
<a name="2453"><!-- --></a>
Similarly, programmers can be relatively fearless about dealing with memory when programming in Java. The garbage collection system makes the programmer&#39;s job vastly easier; with the burden of memory management taken off the programmer&#39;s shoulders, storage allocation errors go away. <p>
<a name="2454"><!-- --></a>
Another reason commonly given that languages like Lisp, TCL, and SmallTalk are good for prototyping is that they don&#39;t require you to pin down decisions early on&#45;&#45;these languages are semantically rich.<p>
<a name="2455"><!-- --></a>
Java has exactly the opposite property: it forces you to make explicit choices. Along with these choices come a lot of assistance&#45;&#45;you can write method invocations and, if you get something wrong, you get told about it at compile time. You don&#39;t have to worry about method invocation error.<p>
