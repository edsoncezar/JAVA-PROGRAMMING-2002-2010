In his science-fiction novel, <em>The Rolling Stones</em>, Robert A. Heinlein comments:<p>
<blockquote>
<a name="572"><!-- --></a>
<em>Every technology goes through three stages: first a crudely simple and quite unsatisfactory gadget; second, an enormously complicated group of gadgets designed to overcome the shortcomings of the original and achieving thereby somewhat satisfactory performance through extremely complex compromise; third, a final proper design therefrom</em>.

Heinlein&#39;s comment could well describe the evolution of many programming languages. Java presents a new viewpoint in the evolution of programming languages&#45;&#45;creation of a small and simple language that&#39;s still sufficiently comprehensive to address a wide variety of software application development. Although Java is superficially similar to C and C++, Java gained its simplicity from the systematic removal of features from its predecessors. This chapter discusses two of the primary design features of Java, namely, it&#39;s <em>simple</em> (from removing features) and <em>familiar</em> (because it looks like C and C++). The next chapter discusses Java&#39;s <em>object-oriented</em> features in more detail. At the end of this chapter you&#39;ll find a discussion on features eliminated from C and C++ in the evolution of Java.<p>

<i><b> Design Goals
</b></i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<a name="2059"><!-- --></a>
<em>Simplicity</em> is one of Java&#39;s overriding design goals. Simplicity and removal of many &#34;features&#34; of dubious worth from its C and C++ ancestors keep Java relatively small and reduce the programmer&#39;s burden in producing reliable applications. To this end, Java design team examined many aspects of the &#34;modern&#34; C and C++ languages<a href="#5543"><sup>1</sup></a> to determine features that could be eliminated in the context of modern object-oriented programming.<p>
<a name="2063"><!-- --></a>
Another major design goal is that Java look <em>familiar</em> to a majority of programmers in the personal computer and workstation arenas, where a large fraction of system programmers and application programmers are familiar with C and C++. Thus, Java &#34;looks like&#34; C++. Programmers familiar with C, Objective C, C++, Eiffel, Ada, and related languages should find their Java language learning curve quite short&#45;&#45;on the order of a couple of weeks.<p>
<a name="364"><!-- --></a>
To illustrate the simple and familiar aspects of Java, we follow the tradition of a long line of illustrious programming books by showing you the <kbd>HelloWorld</kbd> program. It&#39;s about the simplest program you can write that actually does something. Here&#39;s <kbd>HelloWorld</kbd> implemented in Java.<p>
</blockquote><a name="366"><!-- --></a>
<blockquote><pre>    class HelloWorld {<br>        static public void main(String args[]) {<br>            System.out.println("Hello world!");<br>        }<br>    }</pre></blockquote><blockquote>
<a name="1766"><!-- --></a>
This example declares a <em>class</em> named <kbd>HelloWorld</kbd>. Classes are discussed in the next chapter on object-oriented programming, but in general we assume the reader is familiar with object technology and understands the basics of classes, objects, instance variables, and methods.<p>
<a name="3735"><!-- --></a>
Within the <kbd>HelloWorld</kbd> class, we declare a single <em>method</em> called <kbd>main()</kbd> which in turn contains a single <em>method invocation</em> to display the string "Hello world!" on the standard output. The statement that prints "Hello world!" does so by invoking the <kbd>println</kbd> method of the <kbd>out</kbd> object. The <kbd>out</kbd> object is a class variable in the <kbd>System</kbd> class that performs output operations on files. That&#39;s all there is to <kbd>HelloWorld</kbd>.<p>
