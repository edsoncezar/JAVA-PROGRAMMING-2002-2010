In this section of the book you are introduced to the operation
of the Java development environment. A number of authors have
each brought their individual expertise to these topics. To begin,
Mike Cohn introduces Java, and Bryan Morgan explains how the Java
Developer's Kit (JDK) is installed. Then Mike and Bryan examine
in detail the way developers in other languages such as C++, Delphi,
and Visual Basic can leverage their knowledge as a transition
into this new and exciting language.
<P>
Many people believe that Java is only applicable to Web operation.
While the Web is a very important part of Java and one that offers
the greatest promise, it also can be used to develop full-blown
applications that are not dependent on a Web browser. First, Bryan
shows how to develop applets that are downloaded from a Web server;
then Dan Joshi joins these authors and provides details on the
use of Java to develop stand-alone applications.
<P>
At this point the Java development environment is covered in earnest.
Michael Morrison, Michael Nygard, and the other authors delve
into the components of the JDK, and show how to write, compile,
and execute your applets and applications. When things start going
wrong, Java has some built-in debugging capabilities, which Bryan
and Michael Morrison cover in detail.
<P>
In other languages, documentation is a separate process. Often
overlooked, this subsidiary requirement rapidly loses accuracy
as the development heats up. Realizing the importance of good
documentation, the SunSoft folks have included a way to generate
online documentation from the comments that you embed in your
Java code. Mike Cohn examines this process in detail and provides
hints on making the process much more effective.
