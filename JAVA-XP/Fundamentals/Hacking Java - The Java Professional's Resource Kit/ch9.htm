Amid all the excitement and debate over Java's crossplatform abilities,
Java's features as an object-oriented programming language tend
to get lost. Java falls somewhere between C++ and Smalltalk on
the object-oriented scale. The general structure of Java's classes
are similar to C++, but it adds a few more capabilities that are
closer to Smalltalk. For example, the interface mechanism allows
you to invoke methods in an object without knowing the object's
class hierarchy. In C++, you must have a reference to the object's
class or one of its superclasses to invoke a method. Smalltalk,
of course, allows you the ultimate freedom of invoking any method
in any object. This gives Smalltalk GUI designers a huge advantage
in creating reusable components.
<P>
In Smalltalk, when you add a button to your application, you can
tell the button to invoke a specific method in a specific object
whenever the button is pressed. If you were allowed to do this
in Java, it would look something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public class MyClass extends Applet
{
     public void handleButtonPress()
     {
          // code to handle a button being pressed
     }

     public void init()
     {
          Button myButton = new Button(&quot;Press Me&quot;, this,
               handleButtonPress);
     }
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Unfortunately, you can't do this in Java because it doesn't support
pointers or references to functions. You can't even do it effectively
in C++, and it supports function pointers. This problem is solved
in C++ by something called a functor, also known as the Command
pattern in design pattern lingo.
<H2><A NAME="TheCommandPattern"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
The Command Pattern</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The Command pattern addresses the problem of invoking arbitrary
methods in an object. The basic mechanism of the Command pattern
is that you create small objects that implement a specific interface-each
object is responsible for invoking a different method.
<P>
Suppose you want to create buttons for your applet and have each
button invoke a different method in your applet. You could create
your own <TT>action</TT> method in
the applet and handle the <TT>action</TT>
events for the buttons, but that would turn out to be too much
work in a larger applet. Instead, you define an interface like
the one shown in Listing 9.1:
<HR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public interface Command
{
     public void doCommand();
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
Now, to be able to use this interface with a button, you need
a subclass of <TT>Button</TT> that
invokes <TT>doCommand</TT> whenever
the button is pressed. Listing 9.2 shows an implementation of
a CommandButton object that does this.

// This class implements a Button that supports the

// The interface where we will invoke doCommand

<P>
Now, suppose you want to pass parameters when the command is invoked.
For example, suppose you want to assign numbers to buttons and
pass the number as part of the command. You do not need to change
the <TT>Command</TT> interface or
the <TT>CommandButton</TT> class for
this. The key to the Command pattern is the creation of small
command objects that invoke the real methods. Listing 9.3 shows
a small command object implementation whose <TT>doCommand</TT>
method turns around and invokes <TT>changeNumber</TT>
in a <TT>NumberApplet</TT> object.

the <TT>NumberApplet</TT> wants to

<P>
You can also cascade commands, creating command objects that translate
from one command into another. For example, the <TT>ChangeNumberCommand</TT>
object invokes a <TT>changeNumber</TT>
method in a NumberApplet that takes a number. It is a shame that
the object is restricted to <TT>NumberApplets</TT>.
You will probably have many situations where you want to do a
numeric command-a command that takes a number. You should go ahead
and define a <TT>NumberCommand</TT>
interface to handle such situations, as shown in Listing 9.5:

Now, because you have already seen an example where you want to
take an object that invokes a regular <TT>Command</TT>
and turn that into a <TT>NumberCommand</TT>,
you can feel pretty confident that an object that converts from
one to the other will get a lot of use. Listing 9.6 shows the
class to do this.

You will soon end up with a library of commands and command conversions,
such as <TT>StringCommand</TT>, <TT>StringCommandToNumberCommand</TT>,
<TT>BooleanCommandToStringCommand</TT>,
etc. You'll also have new components that invoke these commands,
like <TT>CommandTextField</TT>, which
would invoke a <TT>doCommand</TT>
method in a <TT>StringCommand</TT>
object. These objects take only minutes to write, but they can
save you hours of coding. Figure 9.2 illustrates how some of these
objects might be connected.

Buttons and menu items are very similar in their usage. In fact,
you can think of a menu as a hierarchy of buttons. Both of the
components represent an action without any parameters. Components
like a choice or an option button have an additional parameter
associated with them. For example, with a choice, the parameter
is the new item chosen. For an option button, the parameter is
whether the button is now selected or deselected. Because of the
similarity between Buttons and MenuItems, you can use the same
<TT>Command</TT> interface for both
menu items and buttons. This means that you can create buttons
that are shortcuts for menu items, both sharing the same instance
of a <TT>Command</TT> object. Listing
9.7 shows an implementation of a <TT>CommandMenuItem</TT>.

The AWT <TT>Button</TT> class does
not allow you to display an image in the button, only text. This
is really annoying for people who would like to make toolbars
and other useful GUI components. You can implement an image button
pretty easily by creating a subclass of <TT>Canvas</TT>.
<P>
When creating a custom component using the <TT>Canvas</TT>
class, there are basically two things you have to do-draw the
component and handle input events. For an image button, you also
have the added burden of waiting for the image to be downloaded.
<H3><A NAME="SettingtheSizeofaCanvas">

<P>
The <TT>ImageButton</TT> class, included
on the CD with this book, implements an image button as a subclass
of <TT>Canvas</TT>. It does not require
that the image be completely downloaded before the button can
be displayed. Because you don't always know what size a component
needs to be, thanks to the wonder of layout managers, your image
button class needs to be flexible enough to fit into any layout.
You have a choice of keeping the image the same size all the time
and putting some kind of border around the image, or of resizing
the image itself to match the new button size.<BR>

Whenever you create your own subclass of <TT>Canvas</TT>, you must set the canvas size either by calling the <TT>resize</TT> method or by implementing your own <TT>minimumSize</TT> and <TT>preferredSize</TT> methods.

The <TT>ImageButton</TT> class computes
its preferred size from the size of the image. The minimum size
is the size of the button when there is no image (4x4, which leaves
room for the shadowing effects). The <TT>ImageButtonClass</TT>
also implements its own <TT>size</TT>
method. The <TT>size</TT> method is
used when the button size is fixed. In other words, you can specify
a fixed size for the button that will never be changed by the
layout manager. Listing 9.8 shows the sizing methods for the <TT>ImageButton</TT>
class.

If an image hasn't been downloaded yet, the <TT>getWidth</TT> and <TT>getHeight</TT> methods will return -1. This can cause unpleasant exceptions if you use these values to set the width or height of a canvas. The <TT>ImageButton</TT> class does not have 
that problem because it leaves space on either size of the image. If the image hasn't been downloaded, the <TT>preferredSize</TT> method will return a dimension of 2<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#165;</FONT>2. If it hadn't added 3 to both width and height, it would 

be returning a dimension of -1<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#165;</FONT>-1, which would surely cause an error.

Handling Input Events</A></H3>
<P>
The <TT>ImageButton</TT> class is
concerned only with mouse movements. It needs to know when someone
selects the button. You might think that you would only need to
look for a <TT>MOUSE_DOWN</TT> event,
but it is not that simple. On most systems, if you hold the mouse
down and then move the mouse away from the button before releasing
the mouse, the button pops up as if you had never clicked it.
You often use this functionality if you start to click the wrong
button. The <TT>ImageButton</TT> class
needs to handle that case.
<P>
In order to allow you to move the mouse away from the button while
it is down, you can't trigger the button's action on a mouse click.
Instead, you must trigger it when the mouse is released. That
way, you need to have the mouse pointer on the button, click the
mouse, and release it before you actually perform the button's
action.
<P>
If you were to only implement the <TT>mouseDown</TT>
and <TT>mouseUp</TT> events, you'd
still have one problem. You need to make the button pop back up
when the mouse leaves the button area. This means that the <TT>ImageButton</TT>
class must also implement the <TT>mouseExit</TT>
method. If it did not implement this method, whenever you moved
the mouse away from the button, the button would appear to be
stuck in the down position.
<P>
It would be really nice if you could watch for the mouse entering
the button's area and have the button notice whether the mouse
was up or down and adjust accordingly. Unfortunately, the <TT>MOUSE_ENTER</TT>
and <TT>MOUSE_EXIT</TT> events do
not give any indication of whether the mouse is up or down. The
reason this is nice is that most buttons will automatically pop
down if you move the mouse over them while you are holding the
mouse button down. If you try this with the image button, you'll
see that it does not do this.
<P>
Listing 9.9 shows the mouse event handlers for the image button
class. The mouse event handlers manipulate a <TT>Boolean</TT>
variable called <TT>isDown</TT>, which
keeps track of whether the button is currently up or down. This
value is then used by the <TT>paint</TT>
method to determine whether the button should be drawn up or down.

<P>
The <TT>paint</TT> method is the one
method that you should always see in a subclass of <TT>Canvas</TT>.
You may not handle mouse events or anything else, but you need
to paint the canvas. Otherwise, you'll just get a blank space.
For the image button, the painting is interesting.
<P>
Most window systems use the same basic effect for creating 3-D
effects. You imagine that there's a light shining from the upper-left
corner of the screen. Anything on the screen that is raised (coming
off the screen towards you) would catch the light on its upper
left side, and the lower left side would be in shadow. Anything
that is lowered (going inside the screen, away from you) would
catch light on the lower-right corner, and the upper-left would
be in shade. Also, when a button is lowered, the image or text
in the image is usually shifted a small amount to the right and
down.
<P>
Figure 9.3 shows the image button in the raised position. Notice
that the top and left edges are lighter, while the bottom and
right edges are darker.

Rather than requiring that images be completely loaded, the <TT>ImageButton</TT>
class redraws itself when an image finishes loading. To do this,
it implements the <TT>ImageObserver</TT>
interface. If you only need to know that an image has finished
downloading, you only need to examine the <TT>flags</TT>
parameter to see if the <TT>ImageObserver.ALLBITS</TT>
flag has been set.
<P>
When the <TT>ImageButton</TT> class
learns that the image has finished downloading, it resizes itself
and calls <TT>repaint</TT> to redraw
itself with the completed image. Listing 9.11 shows the <TT>imageUpdate</TT>

Using the Observer Interface</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The <TT>Observer</TT> interface and
<TT>Observable</TT> class implement
another design pattern called the <TT>Observer</TT>
pattern. While you may not have used these two classes yet, you
have seen a similar system in the form of the <TT>ImageObserver</TT>
interface used when dealing with images. The idea behind the <TT>Observer</TT>
interface is that you may have an object that wants to know when
another object changes. For instance, you may be displaying a
car's speed and need to know when the speed changes. Rather than
creating a loop that constantly asks the car how fast it's going,
you simply ask the car to tell you when its speed changes. It's
a simple mechanism, but it can have a huge impact on your design.
<H3><A NAME="TheModelViewControllerParadigm">
The Model-View-Controller Paradigm</A></H3>
<P>
The reason the <TT>Observer</TT> interface
is so effective is that it uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
paradigm. The idea behind MVC is that an application really consists
of three things-a model, some views of the model, and some controllers.
<P>
The model is the part of the application that contains the actual
application logic. It does the database access, it computes numbers,
it manipulates data structures. It is really the heart of your
application. When we talk about separating the user interface
from the application, the model is the application.
<P>
If the model represents the application, then the view and controller
represent the user interface. The user interface is conceptually
split into input components and output components. A controller
is an input component. It supplies information to the model. A
view is an output component-it displays information from the model.
MVC is not some brand new, untested theory-it is the way Smalltalk
applications have been written for many years.
<P>
Pay close attention to the interfaces between the model and your
views and controllers. It is very easy to let a model perform
things that should rightly be part of a view or a controller.
For example, suppose you are doing an aircraft tracking system
and you are getting flight positions from the FAA over a modem.
These positions are in the form of a text message that contains
the aircraft identification and current information about it.
You would have some code reading these messages from the modem
and passing them to another routine that parses the information
out of the message. It is very easy to think of the code that
reads the messages as the controller, and put the parsing mechanism
in the model. It is also wrong. The parsing routine is also part
of the controller. The model should have absolutely no dependence
on the external representation of information. This is an extremely
important point, because it greatly affects the reusability of
your code. You should be able to change input sources and change
output formats without touching the model. In other words, the
model deals with pure information that has no external meaning
attached to it.
<P>
Figure 9.6 shows the conceptual relationship between the model,
the view, and the controller. It also shows how the aircraft tracking
system fits into this model.
<P>
<A HREF="f9-6.gif"><B>Figure 9.6 : </B><I>The model-view-controller paradigm is a
good, object-oriented way of designing applications</I>.</A>
<H3><A NAME="ObservablesandtheModelViewControllerParadigm">
Observables and the Model-View-Controller Paradigm</A></H3>
<P>
The <TT>Observer</TT> interface and
the <TT>Observable</TT> class make
it easier for you to create views of data in the model by creating
a notification system to let your view know when data in the model
has changed. The mechanism is very simple. You create some object
in your model that is a subclass of <TT>Observable</TT>.
Anytime this class changes, it calls <TT>setChanged</TT>
to flag itself as having changed, and then calls <TT>notifyObservers</TT>.
The reason for the separation is that you may run through a series
of checks in your model, any one of which might change the data.
When you have finished, you call <TT>notifyObservers</TT>
one time, rather than notifying the observers after every check.
Whether to notify every time or periodically is a design decision.

Figure 9.7 shows the relationship between an altitude monitor
and an aircraft.

One of the advantages of designing things this way is that <TT>AltitudeMonitor</TT>
could be an add-on feature to your tracking system. You could
create whole sets of monitors similar to this that your customer
could pick from. Notice, however, there's still one little flaw
here. When you add a new aircraft, you have to call <TT>addAircraft</TT>
in the <TT>AircraftMonitor</TT> object.
If you wanted to add new types of monitors, you'd have to call
a similar method in the new monitor. This is not good. You want
to be able to add a new monitor without adding even one line of
code. You can do it, too!
<P>
You can create an <TT>AircraftRegistry</TT>
class that is an <TT>Observable</TT>.
Its job in life is to notify its observers whenever a new aircraft
is added. Instead of calling <TT>addAircraft</TT>
for each different monitor you have in your system, you just call
<TT>addAircraft</TT> in the registry,
and it notifies its observers of the new aircraft. Listing 9.20
shows an implementation of an <TT>AircraftRegistry</TT>
class. It is implemented as a <TT>singleton</TT>
class, which means there is only one in the entire system. A <TT>singleton</TT>
class is implemented by keeping a protected static pointer to
the lone instance of the class. You also hide the constructor
so no one can create their own instance. Then, you create a <TT>static</TT>
method that returns the lone instance of the class, creating a
new one if there wasn't one already.

Now, the <TT>AltitudeMonitor</TT>
class no longer needs the <TT>AddAircraft</TT>
method. Instead, its <TT>update</TT>
method has to be smart enough to know whether the update came
from an <TT>Aircraft</TT> or from
the <TT>AircraftRegistry</TT>. Listing
9.21 shows the updated <TT>AltitudeMonitor</TT>
class.

This may seem like a lot of fuss to you, but it makes your software
much more modular. The <TT>AircraftRegistry</TT>
class provides just the extra level of abstraction to really make
this system modular. Now you can add new monitors without changing
a line of code anywhere in the program. You can dynamically load
new monitors on-the-fly, thanks to Java's class loading interface.
<P>
Figure 9.8 shows the relationship between an aircraft, the aircraft
registry, and the altitude monitor.

<A HREF="f9-8.gif"><B>Figure 9.8 : </B><I>The aircraft registry sends out updates

Listing 9.22 shows a simple program that tests the interaction
between an <TT>Aircraft</TT>, the
<TT>AircraftRegistry,</TT> and the
<TT>AltitudeMonitor</TT> classes.
The <TT>monitors</TT> array contains
a list of the aircraft monitors to be loaded, currently just the
<TT>AltitudeMonitor2</TT> class. This
list could be read in from a file just as easily, so you wouldn't
have to recompile even the test program to add new monitors; however,
for this demonstration, a static array is sufficient.

The only disadvantage of this program dynamically loading the
monitors is that the dynamic loading process can only call the
empty constructor for the monitor. You would have to find alternate
means of the monitors getting their configuration. Although these
examples are fairly specific to a particular application, the
concepts apply to a wide range of applications. Use the <TT>Observer-Observable</TT>
interface to separate components as much as possible. You will
find that it is much easier to plug in new components.
