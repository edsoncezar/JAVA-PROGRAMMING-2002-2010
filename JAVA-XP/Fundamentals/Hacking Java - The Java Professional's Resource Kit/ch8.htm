Applets and Files</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Because of security restrictions, an applet may not read or write
files on the local system. This is to protect you from a malicious
applet storing a virus on your computer or deleting all your files.
Even if you could only read files on the local system, someone
could snoop around on your computer and retrieve private information.
<P>
Before you start exploring the various methods of storing files
from an applet, ask yourself first whether you want your applet
manipulating files directly. If you are designing a system where
you have an applet presenting the user interface for an application
running on a server, you should consider doing all the file access
from the application. The more code you put on the applet, the
longer it takes for it to start up. Even if you have designed
your application this way, you may still have reasons to directly
read and write files from the applet. For example, you might want
to save configuration information for the user interface (colors,
fonts). It wouldn't make sense to make this part of the main application,
because separating the user interface from the application also
means separating the application from the user interface. In other
words, the application shouldn't know anything about the user
interface, except how it interacts with the applet.
<H2><A NAME="UsingtheJFSFilesystemforApplets"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Using the JFS Filesystem for Applets</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The JFS filesystem, by Jamie Cameron, is one of the most useful
sets of Java classes to come along. It provides NFS-like file
and print services for applets. You can get this wonderful product
on the Internet at <B>http://www.ncs.com.sg/java/jfs</B>.
<P>
JFS solves a number of pesky problems for applets. It provides
a way to read and write files, create and delete files and directories,
print files, and open URLs and socket connections to hosts other
than the ones the applets came from. JFS isn't some sort of cheap
hack around Java's security model; it is a full-featured server
system. This means, of course, that you have to run the JFS server,
which is written in Java, to use JFS.
<P>
The <TT>JFSclient</TT> class is the
applet's interface to the JFS server. You create an instance of
<TT>JFSclient</TT> by passing the
host name of the JFS server to the constructor. If you are doing
this from an applet, the host must be the host that the applet
was loaded from, which means your Web server has to run JFS.
<P>
Once you create a <TT>JFSclient</TT>,
you must send a user name and password to the JFS server. JFS
has its own set of user names and passwords; these are not the
operating system's user names. This is quite important because
the applet must contain the user name and password in order to
perform the logon. Anyone with evil intentions and a little patience
can find out the user name and password that the applet sends.
If these were logon IDs for your Web server, it would be simple
for someone to log on to your Web server and wreak all kinds of
havoc. If you forget to send the authentication information, the
other methods in the <TT>JFSclient</TT>
will simply hang, which may not be quite the result you were looking
for.
<P>
Listing 8.1 shows a very simple example that retrieves a file
stored in the JFS file system.

The JFSGet program is very straightforward. It creates a <TT>JFSclient</TT>
object that is connected to a JFS server whose IP address is <B>192.0.0.3</B>,
then it authenticates itself using the name <TT>root</TT>
with no password. Next, it uses the <TT>get</TT>
method to retrieve a file as an array of bytes. Finally, it loops
through the array of bytes and prints them to the <TT>System.out</TT>.

This example does not use an authentication password. In practice, you should always use a password in JFS authentication. Otherwise, you may open your system up to possible corruption from other people on the Internet.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Printing Files Using JFS</A></H3>
<P>
Under most of the current browser implementations, you may not
print Java applets within a Web page. You will usually find an
unfortunate blank space on your printout where the applet should
be. There aren't even any methods or classes within Java to perform
printing functions. While JFS can't quite deal with rendering
the output from your applet on a printer, it does allow you to
send text data to a printer. If you have a PostScript printer,
you could sent PostScript codes to the printer and get graphical
output. Printer access in JFS is done through a special device
called &quot;/dev/Printer.&quot; This one device file represents
all the printers on your system. You choose the printer when you
send a message to this device. Unlike UNIX, in which you use the
same functions to write to devices or files, JFS uses special
methods named <TT>devput</TT> and
<TT>devget</TT> to communicate with
the special devices. When you want to send data to a printer,
you can pass the printer name to the device driver using the <TT>devput</TT>
method. The following code fragment sends an array of bytes to
a printer named myprinter:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
JFSclient myClient = new JFSClient(getDocumentBase().getHost());
byte databytes[] =  (some way of getting data bytes)
Message deviceInfo = new Message();
deviceInfo.add(&quot;Printer&quot;, &quot;myprinter&quot;);
myClient.devput(&quot;/dev/Printer&quot;, databytes, deviceInfo);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The printers are defined in a file called /etc/printers within
the JFS filesystem. If you are running UNIX, you don't need to
be concerned about all these /dev and /etc files. JFS maintains
its own filesystem structure, the root of which can be in any
directory on the system. What JFS calls /etc/printers may really
be /home/mark/jfs/root/etc/printers. The /etc/printers file contains
multiple lines that each contain four fields separated by colons:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
printer name:printer type:printer description:print command
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The default /etc/printers that comes with JFS contains the single
line:

default:Postscript:The Default Printer:lpr
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A NAME="AccessingOtherWebServersfromJFS">
Accessing Other Web Servers from JFS</A></H3>
<P>
One of the other problems that JFS solves for applets is the nasty
restriction of not being able to access any other servers other
than the one the applet came from. The /dev/Web device in JFS
is a URL redirection device that enables you to retrieve data
from any URL on the Net. Use the <TT>devget</TT>
method to tell the /dev/Web device where to get the data from:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
JFSclient myClient = new JFSClient(getDocumentBase().getHost());
Message deviceInfo = new Message();
deviceInfo.add(&quot;URL&quot;, &quot;http://www.mcp.com&quot;);
Message response = myClient.devget(&quot;/dev/Web&quot;, deviceInfo);
byte[] responseData = response.getdata();
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="SavingFilesUsingHTTPPost"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Saving Files Using HTTP Post</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
If you don't want the overhead of JFS, you have some alternatives.
You can take advantage of the existing classes that are able to
post data to a Web server. Remember that when you post data to
a Web server, you are essentially sending it a file. The only
thing you have to do is create something to take the posted data
and store it in a file. This turns out to be a trivial task under
UNIX. The following shell script enables you to store data in
a file:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
echo &quot;Content-type: text/plain&quot;
echo
dd ibs=1 count=$CONTENT_LENGTH of=$QUERY_STRING 2&gt;/dev/null
echo $?
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This script probably requires a bit of explanation. First of all,
the filename that you are storing into is encoded in the URL and
not in the posted data. If you were to call this script <TT>putfile</TT>
and put it in the <TT>cgi-bin</TT>
directory of your Web server, the following URL would try to post
to a file called putme:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
http://mywebhost/cgi-bin/putfile?putme
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The shell script kicks into action by first printing response
data that is required by every CGI program, namely the &quot;Context-type&quot;
information. Next, it prints a blank line, signifying the end
of the header information. Now comes the key to this script-the
<TT>dd</TT> command. This command
is similar to the <TT>cat</TT> command,
except that it has the ability to read and write a fixed number
of records. The <TT>ibs=1</TT> option
tells <TT>dd</TT> to use an input
block size of 1 byte, meaning that the <TT>count</TT>
option will tell how many bytes to read. Because the http server
stores the number of bytes you posted in an environment variable
called <TT>CONTENT_LENGTH</TT>, you
use this variable as the <TT>count</TT>
parameter for <TT>dd</TT>. Finally,
the <TT>of</TT> parameter is the name
of the output file you are writing to. Any error messages are
sent to <TT>/dev/null</TT>, but the
numeric exit code is printed as the final line of the response
generated by the script. If the <TT>dd</TT>
command is successful, the <TT>echo $?</TT>
line will echo a 0.
<P>
Listing 8.2 shows a class that uses the <TT>POST</TT>
command to send data to this script.

The new version of HTTP (HTTP 1.1) includes a <TT>PUT</TT> command that allows you to store a file without creating a separate CGI program to save the file. Some HTTP servers already support this new option. If you have a server that supports <TT>PUT</TT> 

and you want to save files from Java, you won't be able to use the <TT>URL</TT> class to send the file (until the <TT>URL</TT> class supports <TT>POST</TT>). You can, however, use the <TT>PostSockURL</TT> class from <A HREF="ch6.htm" >Chapter 6</A>

As its name implies, the File Transfer Protocol is useful for
sending files back and forth between an applet and a server. You
just need to make sure that your server supports FTP. If you are
running UNIX or Windows NT, it should come with the operating
system. The FTP protocol is defined in Internet RFC 959.
<P>
The FTP protocol requires you to use two different connections
between client and server. The control connection is used by the
client to send commands to the server. The server sends responses
over the control connection. Whenever the client or server needs
to send a large block of data, a data connection must be established.
Figure 8.1 illustrates the connections between a client and an
FTP server.
<P>
<A HREF="f8-1.html"><B>Figure 8.1 : </B><I>A client uses two different connections
to communicate with an FTP server</I>.</A>
<H3><A NAME="SendingFTPCommands">
Sending FTP Commands</A></H3>
<P>
The control connection used in FTP is an ASCII, line-oriented
connection, similar to SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). A
client sends a command to the server as a line terminated by carriage.
The response from the server is one or more ASCII lines containing
a 3-digit return code and a text response. For example, when you
send the <TT>USER</TT> command to
tell the FTP server that you want to log in as <B>mark</B>, you
send:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
USER mark
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The FTP server would respond with a line like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
331 Password required for mark
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The response codes from FTP are grouped into five categories,
based on the first digit in the response code:
<UL>
<LI><TT>1xx</TT> means that the command
has been started successfully, and is in the process of running.
You will get another response when the command completes. When
the server starts transmitting a file it sends a <TT>1xx</TT>
response, and then sends a <TT>2xx</TT>
response when the file has been sent.
<LI><TT>2xx</TT> indicates that the
command has been completed successfully.
<LI><TT>3xx</TT> is sent when the
server accepts your command, but needs more information from you
in order to proceed. This often occurs when you send a <TT>USER</TT>
command and the system wants you to send a password.
<LI><TT>4xx</TT> means that the command
cannot be completed due to some temporary problem. If you send
the same command again, it may be accepted.
<LI><TT>5xx</TT> indicates that the
command cannot be completed. If you try the same command again,
it will be rejected again.
</UL>
<P>
FTP responses can span more than one line. Whenever the server
sends a multiline response, each line begins with the response
code followed by a dash (-). The last line of the response does
not contain a dash. All you have to do when reading responses
is look for a dash as the fourth character. If there is a dash,
you need to read another line. Listing 8.4 shows the <TT>doCommand</TT>
and <TT>getResponse</TT> methods from
the <TT>FTPSession</TT> class which
are included on the CD for this book. These methods are responsible
for sending commands and receiving responses. The <TT>getResponse</TT>
method checks for a dash to see if the response is a multiline
response. You could use these same methods for other Internet
protocols that use this same request-response format, like SMTP.

If you already had a class that implemented the SMTP protocol, you might consider moving the methods for sending and receiving commands into a new superclass for the SMTP class. Then the FTP and SMTP classes would be subclasses of this new class. This kind 

of situation occurs often in object-oriented programming. You discover that there are parts of a class that can be used by other classes, so you split out the reusable parts into a separate class. Obviously, it would have been better if you could have 
anticipated that the parts would need to be reused, but you don't always realize these things ahead of time.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Establishing an FTP Session</A></H3>
<P>
The first step in establishing an FTP session is creating the
connection to the FTP server. FTP connections are normal TCP socket
connections. The default FTP port is 21, but you should allow
for other port numbers, since you may be running a special version
of FTP for another reason.
<P>
Once you have established a connection, the FTP server will send
you a response, which is really just a greeting from the server.
It is very important that you be prepared to read this response
once you have connected to the server. If you don't read the response
and just go on and send a <TT>USER</TT>
command to begin your login, you will be confused and think that
the greeting is the response from the <TT>USER</TT>
command, and you will probably remain confused for the rest of
the session. The greeting usually looks something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
220 flamingo FTP server (Version wu-2.4(1) Wed May 10 21:00:32 CDT 1995) ready
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you connect to the server, you have to log on. At the minimum,
you must send a <TT>USER</TT> command.
This command is in the format:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
USER <I>username</I>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
For example, for you to sign on as <B>mark</B>, you would use
the command line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
USER mark
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Since most user names on an FTP server have a password (if they
don't, there's a security risk), the server will most likely respond
with a command like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
331 Password required for mark
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You would then be required to send a password with the <TT>PASS</TT>
command:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
PASS <I>password</I>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If mark's password is <B>Shh!!!!!</B>, the appropriate <TT>PASS</TT>
command is:

<P>
The response to the <TT>PASS</TT>
command is usually something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
230 User mark logged in.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The FTP protocol allows for a third login parameter called the
<TT>account</TT>, which is sent using
the <TT>ACCT</TT> command. If you
get a response with a response code of <TT>332</TT>
(need <TT>account</TT> for login)
after sending the <TT>PASS</TT> command,
you need to send an <TT>ACCT</TT>
command:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ACCT <I>account</I>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>account</TT> parameter is
rarely used on UNIX systems, and is not restricted to the login
sequence. You could receive a <TT>332</TT>
response code for any operation, meaning that you must supply
an <TT>account</TT> parameter when
performing that operation. For instance, your server may password-protect
files, and could require you to send the password to a file with
the <TT>ACCT</TT> command before you
can retrieve the file.

A simple command is one that does not require a data connection.
Some FTP commands require you to set up a second connection, either
to send raw data to the server, or receive raw data from the server.
Table 8.2 shows you the commands that require a data connection.

Establishing a Data Connection</A></H3>
<P>
Whenever an FTP server needs to transfer raw data to or from a
client, it uses a separate data connection for the transfer. Normally,
the client sets up a listen socket (in Java, a ServerSocket) to
accept an incoming connection from the FTP server. The client
then sends the host address and port number of the listen socket
to the server using the <TT>PORT</TT>
command. The format of the <TT>PORT</TT>
command is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
PORT <I>h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2</I>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>h1-h4</TT> parameters are
the individual bytes in the client's host address. If the client's
host address was <B>192.0.0.1</B>, the bytes would be 192,0,0,1.
The <TT>p1</TT> and <TT>p2</TT>
parameters are the upper and lower bytes of the listen socket's
port number. The following code fragment extracts <TT>p1</TT>
and <TT>p2</TT> from a port number:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
int p1 = (portNumber &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff;
int p2 = portNumber &amp; 0xff;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
An example <TT>PORT</TT> command for
a host with an address is <B>192.0.0.3</B> and a port number of
1234 is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
PORT 192,0,0,3,4,210
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You can verify that the port bytes of 4 and 210 are indeed port
1234 by computing (p1*256) + p2, or (4*256) + 210.
<P>
Once you send the <TT>PORT</TT> command,
you can issue a command that requires a data connection like <TT>RETR</TT>,
<TT>STOR</TT>, or <TT>LIST</TT>.
Once you issue a command that requires a data connection, the
server will connect to the listen socket and either send or receive
data, depending on the command. Figure 8.2 shows the typical interaction
sequence between an FTP server and a client performing a <TT>RETR</TT>
command.
<P>
<A HREF="f8-2.html"><B>Figure 8.2 : </B><I>A server connects to a client to establish
a data connection</I>.</A>
<P>
The normal method of data connection will not work for Java applet
because an applet may not accept an incoming socket connection.
Fortunately, the FTP protocol gives you another option for establishing
a data connection-the <TT>PASV</TT>
command.
<P>
The <TT>PASV</TT> command is similar
to the <TT>PORT</TT> command, except
that it causes the server to create the listen socket. The response
from the <TT>PASV</TT> command gives
the host address and port number for the listen socket in the
same <TT>h1</TT>,<TT>h2</TT>,<TT>h3</TT>,<TT>h4</TT>,<TT>p1</TT>,<TT>p2</TT>
format as used in the <TT>PORT</TT>
command. Here is an example <TT>PASV</TT>
command and the response from the server:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
PASV
227 Entering Passive Mode (127,0,0,1,6,114)
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once the server returns the response, the client can establish
the data connection. Figure 8.3 shows the typical interaction
sequence between an FTP server and a client performing a <TT>STOR</TT>
command, using <TT>PASV</TT> to set
up the data connection.
<P>
<A HREF="f8-3.html"><B>Figure 8.3 : </B><I>The PASV command forces the server to create
the listen socket for the data connection</I>.</A>
<P>
Listing 8.5 shows the <TT>doPasvPort</TT>
method from the <TT>FTPSession</TT>
class. It sends a <TT>PASV</TT> command,
parses the response, and then establishes a socket connection
with the server.

Listing 8.6 shows the <TT>put</TT>
method from the <TT>FTPSession</TT>
class. It uses the <TT>doPasvPort</TT>
command to set up a data connection, then sends a <TT>STOR</TT>
command to the FTP server. The <TT>STOR</TT>
command should return a response code in the 100-199 range, indicating
that the STOR may proceed. When you finish sending the file to
the FTP server, you must close down the data connection. This
tells the server that you have finished. You should then receive
another response from the server over the command connection,
which should have a response code in the 200-299 range.

The <TT>FTPSession</TT> class is quite
simple to use. You just create an instance of <TT>FTPSession</TT>
by passing the destination host name, the user name, and the password
to the constructor, and then using the <TT>get</TT>
and <TT>put</TT> methods to retrieve
and send files, respectively. Listing 8.7 shows an example applet
that copies a file by retrieving it and then storing it under
a new name.

Be extremely careful when using the <TT>FTPSession</TT> class with respect to the user name and password. Even though your applet is compiled, it is fairly trivial to look through the code and find the user name and password that are sent. You should 
either use anonymous FTP, or set up a user account that is not allowed to log on to your system and is allowed to use only FTP. Otherwise, you are broadcasting a free user account all over the Internet whenever you put your applet out there.
