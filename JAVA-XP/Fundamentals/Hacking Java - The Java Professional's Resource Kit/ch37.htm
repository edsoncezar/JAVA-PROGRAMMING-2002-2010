<P>
One thing that attracts thousands of people to the Internet is
its interactive nature. The popularity of multi-user chat programs
like IRC and various multi-user games like MUDs (Multi-User Domain/Dungeon/Dimension)
illustrates that fact very clearly.
<P>
In the beginning, multi-user programs were all text-based. There
are many early multi-user programs that predate the Internet.
Many multi-user programs are still text-based, but they are beginning
to get graphical front ends (another form of encapsulation!).
<P>
Other programs have grown out of single-user versions. Game manufacturers,
for instance, have begun to support Internet connections. This
allows game users to play against each other over the Internet.
<P>
Java adds something that these off-the-shelf games don't really
have. You can download a Java game and play it on any Java-enabled
platform immediately. You can even create a game server that manages
the connections between players. Whenever you add new games to
the server, the players download new Java applets that present
the user interface for the new games.
<P>
The multi-user paradigm isn't restricted to games, of course.
You can set up various kinds of collaborative applications, so
people can solve problems and complete tasks from separate parts
of the world.
<H2><A NAME="DesigningMultiUserApplications"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Designing Multi-User Applications</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
A multi-user application is a slight variation on the typical
client/server application. The only difference is that information
passes from one client through the server to other clients. On
a typical client/server application, information flows only from
the client to the server and back. Figure 37.1 illustrates this
difference.
<P>
<A HREF="f37-1.gif"><B>Figure 37.1 : </B><I>Information f. between users a multi-user
application</I>.</A>
<P>
When you design a multi-user application, you should try to ignore
the network if possible. You can't fully discount the network,
of course. You have to remember that there is a high amount of
overhead between the client and the server. You want to minimize
the number of interactions between the client and server.<BR>

When you create your application, you first create the server,
and a client interface if needed. Next, you create encapsulations
for the various network protocols and remote object systems you
want to support. Figure 37.2 shows an example configuration, where
the server can be accessed through TCP sockets and RMI.

Listing 37.1 shows a server for a simple chat system. The server
relays chat messages to the other users, and notifies the users
whenever a new client enters the system or an existing client

Again, it is important to note that there is no mention of a specific
networking protocol. These two classes represent the core application.
If you design all your applications this way, you will have no
trouble adding other ways to access your application.
<H2><A NAME="AddingSocketBasedAccesstoMultiUserApplications"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Adding Socket-Based Access to Multi-User Applications</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Once you have created an application, you can put a socket-based
front end on it, allowing clients to access it over the network.
Sockets are a low-level means of communication, and are simple
to set up. Sockets are good for sending streams of bytes over
the network. For sending messages, however, you have to do a bit
more work.
<P>
It is very easy to create a socket-based server. First, you create
a <TT>ServerSocket</TT> object that
listens for incoming connections. Next, you use the <TT>accept</TT>
method to wait for incoming connections. The <TT>accept</TT>
method returns an instance of a <TT>Socket</TT>
class, which represents the connection to the new client. After
that, you can use <TT>getInputStream</TT>
and <TT>getOutputStream</TT> to get
streams to reading from and writing to the new client.
<H3><A NAME="CreatingaSocketBasedServer">
 Creating a Socket-Based Server</A></H3>
<P>
The socket-based server is a separate class from the original
application class. The socket server is just a setup-man. It accepts
new socket connections and then creates objects that interact
with the real application and pass the results back to the socket-based
client. The socket-based server itself never interacts with the
application server.
<P>
Figure 37.3 illustrates a socket-based client connecting to the
socket server.
<P>
<A HREF="f37-3.gif"><B>Figure 37.3 : </B><I>A socket-based client connects to the socket
server</I>.</A>
<P>
Next, the server creates a socket-based client object, which implements
the application's client interface. The socket server also tells
the new client object where to find the application object. Figure
37.4 illustrates this step.
<P>
<A HREF="f37-4.gif"><B>Figure 37.4 : </B><I>The socket server creates a socket-based
client object to handle the connection</I>.</A>
<P>
Finally, the socket-based client object interacts with the application,
passing information over the socket connection to the user on
the other end. Figure 37.5 shows this interaction.
<P>
<A HREF="f37-5.gif"><B>Figure 37.5 : </B><I>The socket-based client communicates directly
with the application</I>.</A>

<H3><A NAME="SendingMessagesoverSockets">
Sending Messages over Sockets</A></H3>
<P>
The client handler is where the real work is done. Sending messages
over a TCP socket is a tricky matter. There are no message boundaries
in TCP; it's just a stream of bytes. This means that if you write
50 bytes to the stream, the program on the other end might read
it as two groups of 25 bytes, or 50 single bytes.
<P>
There are two ways to approach this problem. One way is to have
the client and server know what kind of data is being sent at
any time and have them read that correct number of bytes. Typically,
you would send a message type followed by the message bytes. The
program reading the information would determine the length and
content of the data based on the message type.
<P>
The other solution is to put a message length in front of any
message you send over the socket. For example, if you want to
send 223 bytes, you write out 223 as a 4-byte integer value, followed
by the 223 bytes of data. The program on the other end reads the
4-byte length and then sees that the length is 223 bytes.
<P>
There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. When
you send messages as arrays of bytes, you have to take the extra
step of putting the data into the array, rather than writing it
directly to the socket. If you determine the length of the data
based on context, you have to ensure that both ends of the connection
are using the exact same format. In other words, if one side sends
a message containing an integer and a string, the other side had
better be expecting an integer and a string. If you send a message
type that the other side doesn't understand, it can never recover.
It has no idea how many bytes there are in the message data.
<P>
The <TT>TCPChatClient</TT> shown in
Listing 37.4 combines both of these methods. It sends a 4-byte
message type, followed by the data length, and then the data.
It uses <TT>DataInputStream</TT> and
<TT>DataOutputStream</TT> filters
on top of the socket connections so it can write different data
types easily. The <TT>TCPChatClient</TT>
class implements the <TT>ChatClient</TT>
interface that the <TT>ChatServer</TT>
class uses to send a message to a particular client. For each
different protocol you support in a chat server, you will have
a different class that implements the <TT>ChatClient</TT>
interface.

<P>
The rest of the <TT>TCPChatClient</TT>
class deals with messages coming in from the client. The <TT>run</TT>
method reads in an integer message type as the first part of the
message. It then calls an appropriate method to handle the rest
of the message. The <TT>handleChatMessage</TT>
method reads an incoming chat message and passes it on to the
server to be distributed to the rest of the clients. Because this
protocol is extremely simple, there are no other message types
defined. 
<P>
Because you may want to add protocol types at some point, the
server should be able to receive messages it does not understand
without completely dying. In this case, because the length of
the message is always sent after the message type, the <TT>skipMessage</TT>
method can read in and then ignore any message that the server
doesn't understand. You should always provide some sort of safety
mechanism like this. Someone may take this server and really expand
it and then write a nice client for it. If that client then accesses
an original version of the server, it should still be able to
safely use the original version without the server dying.
<P>
If you decide to change the contents of a particular message,
you should assign that message a new message type and continue
to support the old type. If you added a date field to the incoming
chat message, you can't expect all the clients to suddenly support
the new field. You should be able to handle incoming chat messages
with or without the date field. One of the best ways to handle
this is by adding a second message type.
<P>
Version numbers are another common device used for handling multiple
formats for a particular message. When the client connects to
the server, it tells the server which version of the messaging
protocol it uses. If it uses version 2, for instance, it will
be sending a date field in every chat message, while version 1
clients don't send the date field (see Listing 37.5).

The user-side client program is pretty simple to write. It needs
to connect to the <TT>TCPChatClient</TT>
and pass chat messages to it. It must also read any messages sent
by the server. Since the user-side client is reading from two
different places, it needs at least two threads. The <TT>RunTCPClient</TT>
class, shown in Listing 37.7, uses a second class called <TT>TCPChatReader</TT>
to read messages coming from the <TT>TCPChatServer</TT>.
The <TT>TCPChatReader</TT> class calls
methods in <TT>RunTCPClient</TT> to
actually display the results of a message from the server. In
this simple example, the <TT>RunTCPClient</TT>
class just prints the messages to <TT>System.out</TT>.
If you were making a chat applet, however, you would display incoming
messages differently. You could still use the <TT>TCPChatReader</TT>
with a chat applet.

<H2><A NAME="OtherIssuesWhenDealingwithSockets"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Other Issues When Dealing with Sockets</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
When you write socket-based servers, you have to take care of
all the problems that RMI and CORBA normally take care of. For
instance, if a client has a very slow network link, you may have
threads that start blocking when trying to write to the client.
This can cause the server to appear hung for some users.
<P>
Just as you created a thread to read from a client, you can create
a thread to write to a client. You can then create a pipe stream
for sending data to the write thread. The write thread would read
data from the pipe and write it to the client's socket connection.
<P>
You also have the problem of deciding when a user's connection
is hung. Usually when a client disappears, the socket connection
closes. Sometimes, however, the network never receives a message
to close down the connection. You may be queuing up data for a
client that will never read it.
<P>
One way to solve this problem is to keep track of how long a write
thread has been trying to write data to a client. The write thread
sets a flag indicating that it is trying to write and stores the
current time before calling the <TT>write</TT>
method. You then create a thread that runs in the background checking
all the write threads. If it finds a thread that is trying to
write and it has been trying to write for a certain time period
(maybe 10-15 minutes), it closes down the connection to the client.
<H2><A NAME="AddingRMIAccesstoMultiUserApplications"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Adding RMI Access to Multi-User Applications</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
You don't have to implement too many complex client/server applications
using sockets before you wish for something better. It is a huge
hassle to send messages over a socket manually. You must either
write some libraries to help you, or better yet, use a system
that takes care of messaging for you. RMI and CORBA fit this bill
perfectly.
<P>
When you create server encapsulations with RMI and CORBA, you
have to set things up a little differently. The TCP server created
client objects that actually handled the connection. In this design,
the TCP server is acting like a factory; it produces the objects
that handle the connections. The factory model for a TCP server
is somewhat automatic, because the <TT>ServerSocket</TT>
class behaves like a factory of <TT>Socket</TT>
objects.
<P>
When you establish a connection using RMI or CORBA, you connect
directly to an object. There is no new object created on the server
side. This makes it a little more difficult to create multiple-client
objects. You can solve this pretty easily by creating an object
that creates connection handling objects. A client would enroll
to this factor object, as illustrated in Figure 37.6.
<P>
<A HREF="f37-6.gif"><B>Figure 37.6 : </B><I>The client enrolls to the factory object</I>.</A>
<P>
The factory object then creates a new connection handling object
and passes the enrolled client a reference to the new connection
handler. The client and the connection handler now communicate
directly; the factory object is no longer involved. Figure 37.7
illustrates this relationship.
<P>
<A HREF="f37-7.gif"><B>Figure 37.7 : </B><I>The factory creates a connection handler
object that communicates with the client</I>.</A>

Listing 37.9 shows an RMI interface definition for a simple factory
object.

The actual client program that you run is very simple, too. Unlike
the TCP program, it doesn't need to spawn a separate thread, since
RMI is running as a separate thread. The program can concentrate

object, which is the actual application that a user would run.

All you need now is a class to start up the chat application and
set up the TCP and RMI front ends for the application. Because
the application implementation is separate from the networking
protocols, you can run both TCP and RMI interfaces to a single
chat application. This means that RMI users and TCP users can
talk together. Listing 37.15 shows the <TT>RunServer</TT>
class that starts up everything.

You should be able to use these classes as a starting point for
any multi-user application you want to write. Always remember,
however, to keep the application separated from the network protocols.
