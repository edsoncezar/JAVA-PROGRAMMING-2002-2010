Images often account for a large amount of an applet's down-load
time. Even though both the GIF and JPEG formats used by Java involve
data compression, the images can still be rather large.
<P>
Since these images are already compressed, you won't realize much
benefit from additional data compression, either. You need to
find ways of either reducing the original image size or getting
the images in a more efficient fashion.
<H2><A NAME="ReducingImageSize"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Reducing Image Size</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
One of the easiest techniques for quicker downloads isn't part
of Java at all. If you are willing to accept a reduction in image
quality, you can often drastically reduce the size of an image.
<P>
The two formats used by Java are GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)
and JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group-the creators of the
format). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and frequently,
one or the other provides a distinct size advantage.
<P>
The GIF format is geared toward 8-bit images or at least images
with fewer colors. The GIF format works better when storing noncomplex
images. 
<P>
When an image is complex, as in a photograph, GIF does not store
images as well as other formats. It works very well for storing
patterns like a checkerboard or your Web page background.
<P>
The JPEG format was created with photography in mind. It allows
24-bit color and can store images with varying image quality.
<P>
JPEG has a number of optimizations that assume that it is storing
photograph-type images. So when it goes to store something as
mundane as a checkerboard, the resulting file can be several times
as large as the equivalent GIF file.
<P>
Since JPEG allows you to store images with varying quality, you
can reduce the size of a JPEG just by storing it as a lower-quality
image. The quality of an image is actually determined by the amount
of image compression.
<P>
The compression is given as a percentage ranging from 0 to 100.
The higher the amount of compression, the lower the quality. You
don't have to use 0 percent compression all the time when storing
high-quality images. 
<P>
Many images can be stored with 20 percent or even 40 percent compression
with no loss of quality. On the other side, 100 percent compression
does not reduce a file to nothing. 
<P>
The variations in file size are not always in direct proportion
to the change in compression factor. Figure 22.1 shows a 24-bit
image stored with 40 percent compression, whereas Figure 22.2
shows an image stored with 80 percent compression.
<P>
<A HREF="f22-1.gif"><B>Figure 22.1 : </B><I>JPEG can compress many images with no loss
of quality</I>.</A>
<P>
<A HREF="f22-2.gif"><B>Figure 22.2 : </B><I>JPEG images tend to get grainier the more
they are compressed</I>.</A>
<P>
Even though the compression of the second figure is twice the
amount of the first figure, the reduction in file size is much
greater. The file size for the first figure is approximately 96K,
whereas the file size for the second figure is about 16K.
<P>
If you are really concerned with image size, try storing the image
in both GIF and JPEG formats and see which is smaller. If JPEG
is the way you want to go, try varying amounts of compression
to see how much quality you are willing to lose in exchange for
a smaller file.
<H2><A NAME="ImageStrips"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Image Strips</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Every time you download a file over the network, a certain amount
of overhead is involved in setting up the network connection,
no matter how small the file. If you have to download a large
number of files, you lose a lot of time in the connection overhead
alone. 
<P>
To compound the problem, if you download a large number of files
simultaneously, you can't predict which file will be loaded first.
This may not be so bad when you are downloading data files but
if you are doing animation, it can be a pain. 
<P>
You want to present something to the user as quickly as possible,
preferably immediately, even if it's just a &quot;Please wait&#133;&quot;
message. Depending on the animation, you might want to grab the
first frame and display it while waiting for the rest. 
<P>
You might also build up the animation gradually, showing the frames
in order as you get them. For instance, if you have the first
two frames, loop through them, adding the third frame to the loop
when it is loaded.
<P>
You can save yourself a lot of time if you just combine your images
onto a single, larger image and download it. Although it's true
it takes longer than downloading a single frame, the overall time
to download the single image is less than the time it would take
to download 12 frames individually. 
<P>
The image containing all your animation frames is called an <TT><I>image
strip</I></TT>.<BR>

Figure 22.3 shows an image strip consisting of multiple views
of a person with a real head and cartoon body.
<P>
<A HREF="f22-3.gif"><B>Figure 22.3 : </B><I>Combining multiple images onto one image
strip can save you time when downloading</I>.</A>
<P>
You can create an image strip with almost any paint program, as
long as it works with a GIF or JPEG format. One thing to look
for, however, is the ability to determine pixel coordinates. You
need to know exactly where on the image strip each image is located.
<P>
Many paint programs show you the current cursor location somewhere
on the screen, which helps tremendously. If the program has a
zoom feature, it really takes the guesswork out of finding the
images.
<P>
The trick to displaying images from an image strip is that you
make use of clipping. Although you could use the <TT>CropImageFilter</TT>
class to view just a portion of the image, the class adds a lot
of unnecessary overhead. The clipping functions built into the
AWT do the same function only much, much faster.
<P>
When you draw an image from an image strip, you are essentially
viewing the image strip through a lens the size of the image you
want to draw. You move the image strip around underneath the lens
to view a different image. 
<P>
It's like using a microscope. The microscope lens is in a fixed
position. If you want to see a different part of the microscope
slide, you have to move the slide around.
<P>
Since the lens is fixed and you must move the image, you have
to move the image in the opposite direction from the direction
you would move the lens. In other words, if you normally move
the lens 50 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down, you must move
the image 50 pixels to the left and 20 pixels up.
<P>
Figure 22.4 shows the relative positioning of the lens and the
image.
<P>
<A HREF="f22-4.gif"><B>Figure 22.4 : </B><I>You must draw an image strip relative to
the lens</I>.</A>
<P>
In Java lingo, the lens you use to view the image strip is called
the <TT><I>clipping area</I></TT>.
A clipping area is the area in which you can draw. 
<P>
You may have noticed that Java doesn't give you an error when
you try to draw images that are way outside the bounds of your
applet but it also doesn't draw outside the bounds. This is because
all your drawing is done within a clipping region.
<P>
The default clipping region for your applet is the entire area
of the applet. You can change the clipping area, however, with
the <TT>Graphics.clipRect</TT> method.
<H3><A NAME="UsingtheTTFONTSIZEFACECourierGraphicsclipRectFONTTTFONTSIZEMethodFONT">
Using the <TT>Graphics.clipRect</TT>
Method</FONT></A></H3>
<P>
The <TT>clipRect</TT> method in the
<TT>Graphics</TT> class allows you
to change the clipping region of your drawing area. The only restriction
is that you can never enlarge the clipping area.
<P>
To draw an image from an image strip, you first set the clipping
area to the location and size of the image you are drawing. For
example, suppose you want to draw an 80<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#165;</FONT>60
image at location 40,30.
<P>
The corresponding <TT>clipRect</TT>
call, assuming the variable <TT>g</TT>
is an instance of <TT>Graphics</TT>,
would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
g.clipRect(40, 30, 80, 60);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you have created the clipping region, you still draw the
image relative to the whole graphics area. In other words, the
clipping region creates something like a graphics stencil that
protects the rest of the graphics area from being painted, but
you act like you are still painting the entire graphics area.
<P>
Remember that when you use image strips, you really draw the entire
image strip every time; you just create a small window on top
of the image strip so you see only one image at a time. Once you
create a clipping region, you still have to figure out the x and
y coordinates where the image strip should be drawn. The formula
for the image strip's x and y coordinates is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
int imageStripX = clippingRegionX - imageX;
int imageStripY = clippingRegionY - imageY;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>imageX</TT> and <TT>imageY</TT>
variables are the x and y coordinates of the image you want to
draw relative to the image strip. In other words, if you want
to draw an image from an image strip that is at location 50,10
on the strip, you would use 50 for the <TT>imageX</TT>
and 10 for the <TT>imageY</TT> variables.
<P>
For the example of a clipping region at 40,30 and an image location
of 50,10, you would draw the image strip at -10, 20 (that's 40-50,
30-10). To see why this is so, think of what would happen if you
drew the image strip at 0,0. The image you really want is over
at 50,10. Now, shift the image 50 pixels to the left and 10 pixels
up (draw it at -50,-10). Now the image you want to draw is at
location 0,0 on the screen. You really want it at 40,30, however,
so you add 40 to the x coordinate and 30 to the y coordinate,
moving the image you want over to location 40,30. Now if you look
at what you did to the actual x,y of the full image strip, you
moved the x coordinate left 50 and right 40, for a total movement
of left 10, making its x coordinate -10. You shifted the y coordinate
up 10 spaces and down 30 spaces, making a total movement of 20
pixels down, giving a y coordinate of 20.<BR>

Since you can't enlarge the clipping area, once you reduce the clipping area to the size of the image, you can't draw anything outside of that boundary. If you need to draw multiple things in your <TT>paint</TT> method, do the image strip drawing last. 
This becomes a real problem if you do offscreen drawing. Normally, when you do off-screen drawing, you create an offscreen graphics context one time, just after you create the offscreen image. Once you change the clipping region on the offscreen graphics 
context, it stays changed. If you want to reset it, you have to create another offscreen graphics context by calling the <TT>getGraphics</TT> method in the offscreen image. You should probably also call the <TT>dispose</TT> method in the old graphics 
context first to free up its resources.

As you now know, the <TT>clipRect</TT>
method has a serious drawback in that it can only shrink, effectively
limiting you to drawing one image-strip image in a <TT>paint</TT>
method. This may be acceptable in many cases, but you need an
alternative.
<P>
Instead of changing the clipping region, you can create a new
graphics drawing area that is a portion of the current drawing
area. Then, instead of calling the <TT>drawImage</TT>
method in your current drawing area, you call the same method
in the subarea.
<P>
The <TT>create</TT> method in the
<TT>Graphics</TT> class creates a
subarea within the main drawing area. If you change the clipping
region in the subarea, it doesn't affect the main area.
<P>
You don't need to clip the subarea, however, because you can just
create it to be the size of the clipping area you want. To create
a subarea at location 40,30 that is 80<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#165;</FONT>60
pixels, you would do this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Graphics subArea = g.create(40, 30, 80, 60);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You could then draw your image in this subarea:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
subArea.drawImage(imageStrip, -75, -25, this);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you are done with the subarea, you should free up its resources
by calling the <TT>dispose</TT> method:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
subArea.dispose();<BR>
</PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you draw images on a subarea, you do not add the x and y locations of the subarea to the coordinates for the image strip. In other words, if you use a subarea to draw an image that is at location 75,25 on an image strip, you always draw the image 
strip at location -75,-25, no matter where you create the subarea. This is different from the method where you just create a clipping region. The coordinates of the upper-left corner of a clipping region are the coordinates relative to the drawing area. 
The coordinates of the upper-left corner of a subarea are 0,0.</BLOCKQUOTE>

You can use the following method in your programs to draw images
from an image strip without doing all the clipping yourself:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public void drawStripImage(Graphics g, Image imageStrip,
     int drawX, int drawY, int stripX, int stripY,
     int imageWidth, imageHeight)
{
     Graphics subArea = g.create(drawX, drawY, imageWidth,
          imageHeight);
     subArea.drawImage(imageStrip, -stripX, -stripY, this);
     subArea.dispose();
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In the preceding method, <TT>g</TT>
is the original Graphics object from your <TT>paint</TT>
method, <TT>imageStrip</TT> is the
image strip you are drawing from, <TT>drawX,drawY</TT>
are the coordinates where you want to draw the image, <TT>stripX,stripY</TT>
is the location of the image on the image strip, and <TT>imageHeight</TT>
and <TT>imageWidth</TT> are the width
and height of the image.

<P>
You can save a great deal of additional time in downloading if
you put whole frames in an image strip. The animation you are
doing often has pieces that don't change from one frame to the
next. 
<P>
When that is the case, you can save space by storing the common
parts only once. When you draw each animation frame, you put the
parts together to make a whole image.
<P>
The images in Figure 22.3 have many common pieces. In fact, they
were designed by using some common pieces. Every image has an
identical head, and there are only three different body positions.
<P>
The only things that change consistently from frame to frame are
the legs. This kind of partitioning takes a little bit of work
up front, although it actually makes it easier to create multiple
frames on your image strip since you don't have to redraw the
entire frame each time.
<P>
Figure 22.5 shows a reduced image strip that contains only pieces
of the images.
<P>
<A HREF="f22-5.gif"><B>Figure 22.5 : </B><I>Storing only pieces of images that are
put together later can save even more time</I>.</A>
<P>
The file holding the image pieces is about one-fourth the size
of the full set of images. When you piece together images, it
is a good idea to use the GIF format and use a transparent pixel.
<P>
The image in Figure 22.5 uses black as the transparent pixel.
This means that whenever pieces from the image strip are drawn,
any area that is black is not drawn. This allows you to overlay
pieces on top of one another.
<P>
Figure 22.6 shows an applet that puts these pieces together to
form an animated sequence of a silly person walking back and forth.
Notice that you don't see any of the black area from the image
strip, even against the white background. This is because of the
transparency.
<P>

Of the two image formats currently understood by Java, only GIF images may be transparent. The JPEG format does not support transparent images.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
There are several tools available on the Internet for creating
transparent GIFs. On the Windows platform, one of the most popular
tools is PaintShop Pro, available as a shareware program from
<TT><B><A HREF="http://www.jasc.com/pspdl.html">http://www.jasc.com/pspdl.html</A></B></TT>.
Remember that shareware programs are not free. If you use it,
you should pay for it.
<P>
The GIFTOOL program, from <TT><B><A HREF="http://www.homepages.com/tools/giftool">http://www.homepages.com/tools/giftool</A></B></TT>,
is available on a wide variety of platforms and is also a shareware
program. GIFTOOL is a little tougher to use since it is a command-line
tool, but its availability on many platforms is appealing.
<P>
The idea behind transparent GIFs is that you mark one of the colors
in the GIF color table as being a transparent pixel. Obviously,
you must be using an indexed color model to create a transparent
image. This is why JPEG cannot support transparent pixels-JPEG
always uses 24-bit color, which never needs a color index.
<P>
When you draw images based on pieces, you must pay special attention
to the relative positions of the different parts. When you draw
a multipart figure at a particular location, how do you decide
exactly where to draw the pieces?
<P>
For the animated figure in Figure 22.6, you might say that the
figure's location is determined by the upper left corner of the
head. In other words, if you want to draw the figure at location
40,20, you draw the head so that the head part of the image is
drawn at 40,20. You must then determine the position of the other
parts relative to the head.
<P>
For example, in Figure 22.6, the body portion is drawn 48 pixels
down and 6 to the right from the upper left corner of the head.
These locations are determined by using a paint program or other
tools. Once you determine the relative positions of the pieces,
you can store them in the following class:
