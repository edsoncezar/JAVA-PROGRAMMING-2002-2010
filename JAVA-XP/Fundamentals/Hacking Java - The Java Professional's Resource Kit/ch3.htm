Applet Security</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Applet security is generally regarded as a necessary pain by most
Java programmers. The ability to download code on-the-fly is a
major advantage, but it is also a wonderful tool for the same
kind of people who like to write viruses that infect your PC.
Fortunately, the designers of Java took that into account and
developed a security model that protects your system from malicious
attacks. You may consider some of the applet security restrictions
draconian, but it is much better to have too much security than
too little-especially when Java is still striving for acceptance.
Theserestrictions do not apply to applications, because they are
meant to access local files and the local network. The security
restrictions are there to protect you from unknowingly loading
a malicious program that can be hidden on a Web page. You have
to manually run an application on your local system, however,
so you are responsible if the application is malicious.
<P>
Security restrictions vary from browser to browser. Netscape,
for instance, has a very tight security model, although HotJava
allows you to switch off some of the security restrictions.
<P>
The Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3 (IE3) supports several
security models from completely relaxed (no restrictions) to completely
secure (won't download and run applets at all). In addition, IE3
allows digitally signed classes to have fewer restrictions.<BR>

Many browsers, including HotJava, IE3, and Netscape, relax the security policy for applets that are loaded from files on the local system-that is, files that are loaded with a type of &quot;file:&quot;. If you load a file with &quot;http:&quot;, even if 
the file is stored on your local drive, you will be under the full scrutiny of the security manager.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="FileAccessRestrictions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
File Access Restrictions</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
File access is one of the most vulnerable places for malicious
attacks. If someone were able to modify files on your system when
you ran an applet, they could implant viruses on your system or
just destroy data directly. For this reason, no applet is allowed
to access the local filesystem in any way-not even in a read-only
mode. After all, you wouldn't want someone implanting invisible
applets on their Web page just so they could snoop your hard drive
and copy files from it. You may be allowed to read and write files
if your applet is loaded from the local filesystem using a URL
of type &quot;file:&quot;.
<P>
The inability to read and write files poses a major challenge
for applet writers. For the moment, the only solution is to read
and write files on applet's home Web server.
<H2><A NAME="NetworkRestrictions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Network Restrictions</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The network restrictions in Java may seem a little overboard,
but they are there for good reason. The general philosophy of
network security is that applets can only make network connections
back to the Web server they were loaded from. An applet may not
listen for incoming socket connections, nor can it listen for
datagrams (connectionless network data) from anywhere but its
home server. It also can only send datagrams back to its home
server.
<P>
These security restrictions are intended to protect organizations
that have Internet firewalls set up. In case you are unfamiliar
with the intricacies of Internet security, many companies have
large internal IP networks (the main networking protocol of the
Internet). These networks are connected to the rest of the world
through machines called &quot;firewalls.&quot; A firewall's job
in life is to protect the internal IP network from prying eyes
in the outside world while allowing people on the inside to access
data out on the Internet. These firewalls usually render the internal
network invisible to the rest of the world. Given the clever ways
people have found to attack systems, it is best to not give out
any information about host names or addresses on the internal
network.
<P>
The problem with Java is that applets run inside the firewall
on your local machine. This means that without any network restrictions,
your entire network is exposed to any malicious applets. You might
be thinking that it would be nice if you could just tell your
browser the names of hosts that you trust. It would not be difficult
for the security system in Java to handle that, but it would keep
your poor network administrator on a steady supply of indigestion
medication, wondering when someone will trust an untrustworthy
host. If you're an administrator at a site using HotJava, go ahead
and get yourself a good spoonful of Maalox-you can completely
turn off the networking restrictions in HotJava! Keep in mind,
also, that Internet Explorer also lets you turn off all security
restrictions. Netscape does not support such an option, however.
<P>
If your applet is loaded from the local filesystem, you can get
around these security restrictions. You may have to set the <TT>appletviewer.security.mode</TT>
system property to <TT>unrestricted</TT>
to completely get around these restrictions. Because one of the
other restrictions on applets is that they cannot change the system
properties, you'll have to come up with unique ways of getting
around this.
<H2><A NAME="OtherSecurityRestrictions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Other Security Restrictions</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
In addition to the file and network restrictions, most environments
also place a few other interesting restrictions. They are discussed
in this section.
<P>
Non-local applets may not access the system properties. A local
applet may read and write the system properties. If an applet
were able to change the system properties, any applet could change
the <TT>appletviewer.security.mode</TT>
property, for instance, and throw open a huge security hole. Other
system properties contain information about the local machine,
which could include the host name and IP address. If the machine
is safe behind a firewall, you might not want this information
getting out.
<P>
Non-local applets may not define their own class loaders. This
is really an unfortunate restriction, because the ability to define
new ways to add classes to the runtime system is one of Java's
neatest features. The problem comes with the fact that when your
class refers to another class, the system first goes to the class
loader for your class to find the class you are referring to.
If you wanted to create an applet that could read and write local
files, you could create your own <TT>InputStream</TT>
and <TT>OutputStream</TT> classes
that did not consult the <TT>SecurityManager</TT>
object for permission. When your applet is loaded via your custom
class loader, the class loader will be asked if it can load the
<TT>InputStream</TT> and <TT>OutputStream</TT>
classes. A well-behaved loader would simply load the system versions
of these classes, but an evil class loader will load the non-secure
versions of these.
<P>
Applets may not call native methods. It would be terrible to have
all these nice security measures built into Java, only to have
an applet come along and bypass them completely by calling the
native methods that are used by the system classes. For example,
a malicious applet could call the native socket functions directly
and snoop around the local network.
<P>
Applets cannot execute commands on the local system using the
<TT>Runtime.exec</TT> method. Otherwise,
a malicious applet could come along and execute commands to delete
all your files.
<P>
Applets may not be able to define classes that belong to certain
packages. Typically, they cannot define classes for the <TT>java</TT>
and <TT>sun</TT> packages. Also, Netscape
does not permit applets to define classes in the <TT>netscape</TT>
package.
<P>
When a non-local applet opens a top-level frame (a window separate
from the browser), the frame contains a warning message indicating
that the applet is not trusted.
<H2><A NAME="GettingAroundSecurityRestrictions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Getting Around Security Restrictions</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
This is a touchy subject because the Java security system is in
place for good reason. Many companies would like to create Java
applets that freely access other systems within the company's
intranet, while denying such access to applets loaded from the
Internet. Companies can do this if they load their intranet applications
from local files. This is not acceptable in many cases, however.
One of the advantages of downloading code is that software distribution
is a snap. You just put the new copy of the program on your Web
server. If you have to copy your intranet applets to each client,
you are back in the old system administration nightmare.
<H3><A NAME="UsingDigitalSignaturesforIncreasedAccess">
Using Digital Signatures for Increased Access</A></H3>
<P>
The Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3 is the first major browser
to implement digital signatures for applets. This digital signature
mechanism allows you to permit applets from certain trusted sites
to have more access to your local system. Internet Explorer's
approach to digital signatures is basically an all-or-nothing
approach. If an applet is digitally signed, it is considered to
be a trusted applet and is allowed much more access, including
the ability to write local files.
<P>
In order to take advantage of digital signatures for Internet
Explorer, you need to pack-age your applets in Microsoft's cabinet
format. Cabinets are discussed more fully in <A HREF="ch14.htm" >Chapter 14</A>, &quot;Creating
Your Own Class Archive Files.&quot;
<P>
When you create your cabinet file, make sure you use the <TT>-s</TT>
option to leave room for the digital signature. The following
command packs all the .class files in the local directory into
a cabinet called <TT>MyCab.cab</TT>
and leaves 6,144 bytes at the beginning of the cabinet for the
digital signature:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cabarc -s 6144 n MyCab.cab *.class
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The tools for digitally signing your code are included with the
Microsoft ActiveX SDK, available from <B><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/activex">http://www.microsoft.com/activex</A></B>.
The ActiveX development kit is free, and you can use the digital
signature programs without any additional packages. If you want
to develop ActiveX programs, however, you also need the Microsoft
Windows SDK.<BR>

To digitally sign your code for Internet Explorer you must have a Software Publishers Certificate, signed by a trusted certificate authority. You can find information on obtaining this certificate from Microsoft's Web server at <TT><B><A 
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/signcode">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/signcode</A></B></TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Once you have created a cabinet file, use the SignCode program
to digitally sign your code. If you simply type <TT>signcode</TT>
on the command line, you will be presented with a handy step-by-step
windowed interface for signing code. You can also use the command-line
version of <TT>signcode</TT>. If your
Software Publishers Certificate is in the file <TT>MyCert.spc</TT>
and you want to use a private key called <TT>MyKey</TT>
to sign <TT>MyCab.cab</TT>, you would
use the following command:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
signcode -name MyCab.cab -spc MyCert.spc -pvk MyKey
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once your cabinet is signed, any class loaded from that cabinet
is trusted by Internet Explorer and is allowed free access to
the local system.
<P>
Java 1.1 includes support for digitally signed Java classes. Under
Sun's security policy, you are able to restrict access based on
the signature. If a class is signed by Sun, you might permit it
full access to your system. If the class is signed by a vendor
that you do not completely trust, however, you might give it only
limited abilities.
<P>
Because digital signatures are a part of Java 1.1, eventually
all Java-enabled browsers will contain code to support digitally
signed applets. These applets will be given much more freedom
to access the local system. For now, however, if you really need
to create applets that have little or no security restrictions,
you have to create your own custom security manager.
<H3><A NAME="CreatingaCustomizedSecurityManager">
Creating a Customized Security Manager</A></H3>
<P>
Creating a security manager is a difficult job, and any little
error in programming can expose your system to attacks. Most security
managers use the <TT>inClassLoader</TT>
method to determine whether the current class was loaded by the
<TT>AppletClassLoader</TT> class.
If it was loaded by the applet class loader, it is subjected to
the applet security restrictions. If you can legally get ahold
of the source to an existing security manager, you should take
a good look at it before attempting to create your own security
manager.
<P>
Listing 3.1 shows a skeleton security manager. It performs no
checks whatsoever, so you should use it only for your intranet
applications-or better yet, just for testing.

<P>
Once you have created your own custom security manager, you can
install it over the existing security manager in the browser you
are using. Netscape stores its classes either in moz2_x.zip (moz2_0.zip,
moz2_01.zip, and so on) or moz3_x.zip, depending on whether it
is Netscape 2.x or Netscape 3.x. HotJava stores its classes in
classes.zip. Internet Explorer also stores its files in classes.zip,
which is usually found in the C:\WINDOWS\JAVA\CLASSES directory.
<P>
You'll need a zip program to replace the old security manager.
See the section &quot;Creating Your Own Archive File with Info-ZIP&quot;
in <A HREF="ch14.htm" >Chapter 14</A>, &quot;Creating Your Own Class Archive Files,&quot;
for more information on zip programs and creating Java class .zip
files.
<P>
To install this security manager in a Netscape mozxxx.zip (moz2_0.zip,
moz2_1.zip, and so on) file, perform the following steps:
<OL>
<LI>Go to the directory in which the mozxxx.zip file is stored.
<BR>
Under Win 95/NT, this is probably Program<BR>
Files\Netscape\Navigator\Program\Java\classes.
<LI>Create a subdirectory called Netscape, and then create a subdirectory
under that called applet.
<LI>Copy the AppletSecurity.class file you compiled into the Netscape/applet
(or Netscape\applet) subdirectory.
<LI>Make a backup copy of the mozxxx.zip file; you'll need it
if you want to go back to the old security manager.
<LI>zip -0 -u mozxxx.zip Netscape/applet/AppletSecurity.class
</OL>
<P>
The procedure for HotJava is almost identical:
<OL>
<LI>Go to the directory in which the classes.zip file is stored.
<BR>
Under Win 95/NT, this is probably \hotJava\lib.
<LI>Create a subdirectory called sun, and then create a subdirectory
under that called applet.
<LI>Copy the AppletSecurity.class file you compiled into the sun/applet
(or sun\applet) subdirectory.
<LI>Make a backup copy of the classes.zip file; you'll need it
if you want to go back to the old security manager.
<LI>zip -0 -u classes.zip sun/applet/AppletSecurity.class
</OL>
<P>
The procedure for installing your own security manager for Internet
Explorer is also very similar:
<OL>
<LI>Go to the directory in which the classes.zip file is stored.
It should be C:\WINDOWS\JAVA\CLASSES, but may be slightly different
if your Windows directory is in a different place. For instance,
it might be C:\WINNT\JAVA\CLASSES.
<LI>Create a subdirectory called com, and then create a subdirectory
under that called ms. Under the com\ms directory, create another
subdirectory called applet.
<LI>Copy the AppletSecurity.class file you compiled into the com\ms\applet
subdirectory.
<LI>Make a backup copy of the classes.zip file; you'll need it
if you want to go back to the old security manager.
<LI>zip -0 -u classes.zip com/ms/applet/AppletSecurity.class
</OL>
<P>
The next time you start your browser, your applets should be completely
unrestricted.<BR>
