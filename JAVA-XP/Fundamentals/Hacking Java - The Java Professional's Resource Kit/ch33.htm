<P>
Many companies get their feet wet on the Web by creating a static
display-only page. This may be nice from a marketing perspective,
but Web surfers find little use for these pages. The real power
of the Web is that you can provide a way for customers to interact
with your business.
<P>
When customers can do business with your company over the Web,
they can conduct business at any time of day, from anywhere in
the world. They don't have to wait for a salesman, they aren't
stuck on hold waiting for an operator-you can give them all the
information they need and the power to place orders right at their
fingertips.
<P>
One of the reasons more companies aren't operating this way is
that so many companies have older systems that aren't very Web-friendly.
IBM has begun to address this problem for many of their customers,
providing Web server software for the AS/400 line, and gateway
software to access CICS systems. <A HREF="ch34.htm" >Chapter 34</A>, &quot;Interfacing
with CICS Systems,&quot; shows you ways to access a CICS system.
<P>
If your company has a legacy system that needs to be accessed
from the Web, you can use the encapsulation techniques from Chapter
32, &quot;Encapsulating Legacy Systems,&quot; to help you.
<H2><A NAME="UsingEncapsulationstoAccessLegacyData"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Using Encapsulations to Access Legacy Data</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
When you want to connect a legacy system to the Web, you will
probably want the Web server to act as a client to the legacy
system. You must first figure out what kind of things you want
to do on the Web, then design an interface to the legacy system
that supports the functions you want.
<P>
Using the encapsulation techniques you learned in <A HREF="ch32.htm" >Chapter 32</A>,
you create an object that both interacts with the legacy system
and presents a nice Java front-end to it.
<H3><A NAME="AimingforSessionLessTransactions">
Aiming for Session-Less Transactions</A></H3>
<P>
Typical Web accesses are session-less. In other words, each time
you access a document on the Web server, or post data to it, you
set up a new connection to the server. From the Web server's point
of view, this means that it never knows when a particular user
is going to send another message.
<P>
In a session-oriented system, there is a distinct session initiation,
an exchange of messages, and a session shutdown. The nice thing
about session-oriented transactions is that you don't have to
do everything at once. For instance, if you are booking a number
of flights on an airline, you can try to book the first flight.
If that succeeds, you book the second flight. If the first flight
is full, you can try an alternate. Once you have selected the
flights you want, you finish the transaction and everything is
saved. You could also abort the transaction, canceling all your
reservations automatically.
<P>
You can't do this kind of thing with session-less transactions.
You have to do everything you want at one time. For instance,
you would try to book your whole flight itinerary. If it failed
for some reason, you'd make adjustments and try the whole thing
again. This is generally less convenient for you but more convenient
for the server.
<P>
If your legacy system already supports a session-less transaction
system, you don't really have to do anything. If not, you can
use encapsulation to fake it. When your Web server receives a
request and invokes a method in your encapsulation, the encapsulation
performs all the steps required to complete the transaction. In
other words, it establishes a session, exchanges information with
the legacy system, then finishes the transaction.
<H3><A NAME="StoringSessionInformationintheWebPage">
Storing Session Information in the Web Page</A></H3>
<P>
Sometimes, you want to keep the session-oriented transaction protocol,
either because it is convenient or because you have no choice.
In these situations, your Web server needs to be able to take
an incoming request and determine which session it belongs to.
<P>
The easiest way to do this is to store a session identifier on
the Web page in a hidden variable. Whenever you process a request,
you look for this hidden variable. If it isn't there, you can
assume that it's a new session. You associate this session identifier
with whatever data you need to keep for your session with the
legacy system. Typically, you would store the session identifier
in a hash table.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>Note</B></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In order to keep a session going like this, you cannot use CGI. A CGI program would terminate after each request, taking down the session with the legacy system. The Java Servlet API is very well-suited for this kind of task, however.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
From the time a client first initiates a session, the sequence
would go like this:
<OL>
<LI>The client accesses the URL for the Web service.
<LI>The Web service creates a session with the legacy system,
then creates a unique session identifier and stores the session
information in a hash table using the session identifier as a
key.
<LI>The Web service returns an HTML page to the client that contains
fields for entering data for the session, along with a hidden
field containing the session identifier.
<LI>The client enters some data for the session and clicks the
submit button.
<LI>The Web service reads in the fields from the client's page,
including the session identifier. It uses this identifier to locate
the session with the legacy system.
<LI>The Web service updates the current transaction with whatever
information was sent by the client, and returns another HTML page
containing the same session identifier.
<LI>When the client signals that it wants to finish the transaction,
the server uses the session identifier again to locate the session
with the legacy system. It then asks the legacy system to finish
the transaction and close down the session.
<LI>The server removes the session information from the hash table,
because the session has been completed.
</OL>
<P>
Listing 33.1 shows a servlet that uses a simple sequence number
for a session ID. It uses a text field to build up a string of
text. Anytime text is entered in the field, it appends the text
to the current session text. It also provides a checkbox to signal
that the transaction is complete.

Figure 33.1 shows the output from the <TT>SessionServlet</TT>
servlet.
<P>
<A HREF="f33-1.gif"><B>Figure 33.1 : </B><I>You can maintain a session ID using a hidden
variable</I>.</A>
<H3><A NAME="UsingHTTPCookiestoPreserveSessionInformation">
Using HTTP Cookies to Preserve Session Information</A></H3>
<P>
One of the ugly parts of hidden variables is that they show up
as part of the URL. If your browser shows the current location,
you can see the session ID embedded within the URL. Aside from
a security risk, which will be discussed shortly, the hidden variable
causes unnecessary clutter in the URL.
<P>
The cookie protocol provides a nice alternative to hidden variables.
Actually, cookies are intended more for permanent information.
In other words, cookies were intended to be saved by the browser
and used every time you run the browser. If you don't give a cookie
an expiration date, however, the browser doesn't save it to disk.
The cookie disappears when you exit the browser.
<P>
The only sticky point is that there is not a clean way to erase
a cookie. In the case of a session, you want to erase the session
cookie when the session is terminated. You can kludge around the
lack of an erase mechanism by setting the session ID to some phony
value like &quot;erased.&quot; Whenever the session ID cookie
has a value of &quot;erased,&quot; treat it as though it were
null.
<P>
Jeeves has a built-in cookie class, making it very easy to parse
cookies and generate them. All you have to do, in order to use
cookies instead of hidden variables, is change the way you read
and write the information.
<P>
For instance, in the previous example, you read the session ID
by saying:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Hashtable params = req.getQueryParameters();
String sessionId = (String) params.get(&quot;sessionId&quot;);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To use a cookie instead, you have to use a few more lines. You
must first get the cookie string from the header:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// get the cookie value(s)
String cookieStr = req.getHeader(&quot;Cookie&quot;);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Then, if there were a cookie string, you must extract the <TT>sessionId</TT>
cookie:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Cookie cookie = null;

String sessionId = null;

// If there was a cookie string, convert it to a cookie object
// and then fetch the sessionId value

if (cookieStr != null) {
cookie = new Cookie(cookieStr);

sessionId = cookie.getValues(&quot;sessionId&quot;);

// Netscape doesn't seem to like to erase a cookie while it's still
// running, so we hack around it by creating a session id of &quot;erased&quot;
if ((sessionId != null) &amp;&amp;
      sessionId.equals(&quot;erased&quot;)) {
      sessionId = null;
}
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Unlike the hidden variable example, you still have to write out
cookie information when the session ID has expired or you have
finished the transaction. As you now know, you can't simply erase
a cookie, so we have a special kludge to handle erasing the cookie:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// If we need to write out a session id, create a cookie and
// write it out.

if (!isFinished &amp;&amp; !isExpired) {
cookie = new Cookie(&quot;sessionId&quot;, sessionId);
cookie.setPath(&quot;/servlet/SessionCookie&quot;);
resp.setHeader(&quot;Set-Cookie&quot;, cookie.toString());
} else {

// If expired or finished, set the sessionId to &quot;erased&quot;

cookie = new Cookie(&quot;sessionId&quot;, &quot;erased&quot;);
cookie.setPath(&quot;/servlet/SessionCookie&quot;);
resp.setHeader(&quot;Set-Cookie&quot;, cookie.toString());
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A NAME="ChoosingaGoodSessionIdentifier">
Choosing a Good Session Identifier</A></H3>
<P>
If you are concerned about security (and you should be), you need
to be very careful when creating a session identifier. The technique
used in the preceding example, where you just use a sequential
numbering system, is completely unacceptable.
<P>
The reason you need to be careful with the session identifier
is that someone could come along and take over someone else's
session if they could guess the session identifier. Even though
there are 4 billion possible identifiers in a 32-bit number, you
can figure out where the current count is by setting up your own
session and seeing what session ID you have been assigned. Then
you could guess in the neighborhood of that session ID number.
<P>
Don't think that cookies prevent this, either. Just because you
can't see the cookie from the browser doesn't mean that someone
couldn't write a program that establishes a session and prints
out the cookie value it was given. You could use the cookie code
in <A HREF="ch6.htm" >Chapter 6</A> &quot;Communicating with a Web Server,&quot; to
do that.
<P>
As you've heard so many times, you have to start with secure communications.
You have to ensure that no one can spy on another user and figure
out their session ID. Once someone gets the session ID, it's all
over. They can take over someone else's session. Next, you need
to generate a reasonable session ID. Actually, a random session
key that you might generate for secure private key communications
would work in this situation. When you generate the session ID,
you need to check your session ID table to make sure that you
haven't chosen an ID that is already in use.
<H3><A NAME="ClearingOutOldSessions">
Clearing Out Old Sessions</A></H3>
<P>
One of the difficulties in trying to maintain a session in a session-less
world is that the server never knows when a client has decided
it doesn't want to talk anymore. Obviously, a client is going
to tell you whether it wants to abort a transaction, or end one.
But what do you do if the client completely forgets about you?
<P>
For instance, the client browser could crash and lose the session
key. You probably don't have a good way to recover the key, especially
since any such mechanism would make you vulnerable to impersonations.
At some point, your service must decide that a client session
is never going to complete.
<P>
The simplest way to age out old sessions is to store the last
access time somewhere in your session information. Then, at periodic
intervals, a background thread goes through the entire table of
sessions and removes every session that has not been accessed
within a certain time period.
<P>
The only thing you have to do in this case is figure out what
a reasonable time period is. It might be 15 minutes, it might
be an hour, it might be a week. The timeout period depends on
the kind of interaction people do with your server. Generally,
give your users more than a reasonable amount of time to perform
their transactions. If a normal transaction is five minutes, maybe
you should give them an hour or more. If it takes an hour, give
them a day.
<H2><A NAME="AccessingLegacyDatafromServlets"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Accessing Legacy Data from Servlets</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Hopefully, you have been creating your legacy system encapsulations
in Java, or at least designed them to be Java-friendly. If this
is the case, you can use Java servlets to quickly put your legacy
system out on the Web.
<P>
Conceptually, you have a servlet running in a Java Web server
that communicates with your legacy system encapsulation, which,
in turn, talks to your legacy system. Figure 33.2 illustrates
this relationship.
<P>
<A HREF="f33-2.gif"><B>Figure 33.2 : </B><I>Web access to legacy system involves a
servlet and an encapsulation</I>.</A>
<P>
One of the things that makes system design so interesting is the
number of ways you can implement a system. The trick, of course,
is choosing the best way, or at least striking a good balance,
between the different factors that affect performance and maintainability.
<P>
The most basic way to access legacy data from a servlet is to
have the servlet and the legacy encapsulation code running in
the same Java environment. Figure 33.3 illustrates this configuration.
<P>
<A HREF="f33-3.gif"><B>Figure 33.3 : </B><I>In the most basic configuration, the servlet
and encapsulation reside in the same place</I>.</A>
<P>
This configuration can support all the different types of encapsulations
from <A HREF="ch32.htm" >Chapter 32</A>. For example, you can invoke methods on an encapsulation
that uses native methods. Listing 33.2 shows an extremely basic
servlet that invokes the <TT>listParts</TT>
native method in the <TT>Ordering</TT>
class from <A HREF="ch32.htm" >Chapter 32</A>.

<P>
You don't have to restrict the servlet from running in the same
Java environment as the legacy system encapsulation, however.
You can use CORBA, RMI, or even TCP/IP to link the servlet to
the encapsulation. Figure 33.4 shows an example configuration

Servlets are a big advantage over CGI when you need to do session-oriented
transactions with a legacy system. Servlets stick around between
requests, so the sessions with the legacy system are preserved
for the next time. You already have a framework for tracking these
sessions; all you need to do is put it together with your legacy
system encapsulation and you're ready to hit the Web.
