<FONT COLOR=#000000>Jeeves is a Java-based Web server development
toolkit that includes a fully functional HTTP Web server. This
chapter describes how to write servlets that extend the function
of the HTTP server using the Web server toolkit.</FONT>
<P>
The chapter begins by introducing the HTTP server's architecture.
You will go through the process of administering the server. This
background knowledge lays the foundation for the rest of the chapter.
<P>
In the second part of the chapter, you learn how to write servlets
that extend Jeeves' functions. This section begins with an introduction
to the servlet API, which is at the heart of Jeeves' functionality
and extensibility. You then learn about Jeeves' rich collection
of tools that enhance servlet development.
<P>
Finally, two examples show you what can be done with servlets
and Jeeves. The first is a database servlet that puts a Web front
end on any database that supports the Java Database Connectivity
(JDBC) interface. The second takes advantage of Java's object
serialization to create a simple example of an autonomous agent
system.
<H2><A NAME="WhatIsJeeves"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
What Is Jeeves?</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Jeeves is often described simply as a Java Web server, but it
is much more. Jeeves is a server development toolkit. At the center
of the Jeeves toolkit is a package of generic server classes.
With these classes, any developer can quickly build connection-oriented
servers.
<P>
Another important component of the toolkit is the <TT><I>servlet</I></TT>.
Servlets are Java objects that comply with the servlet API and
are used to add functions to Web servers. The servlet API is Sun's
proposed standard for extending Web server functions with Java.

<P>
In addition to the servlet API and the generic server classes,
the Jeeves toolkit includes security classes, administrative classes,
utility classes, and a set of servlets that provide basic Web
server functions.
<P>
The Jeeves HTTP server was developed from this toolkit and is
a fully functioning Web server that provides all the features
common to other Web servers.<BR>

The Jeeves HTTP Server </FONT></A></H2>
<P>
This part of the chapter introduces you to the Jeeves HTTP server.
It begins with an architectural overview and then moves on to
basic server installation and administration.
<P>
By the end of this section, you'll have a basic understanding
of the server architecture and administrative design. This lays
the foundation for extending the server with servlets, which you
will learn how to do in the second part of this chapter.
<H3><A NAME="ArchitecturalOverview">
Architectural Overview</A></H3>
<P>
The Jeeves HTTP server is built on the framework provided by the
generic server classes discussed earlier. This framework is the
core of the Jeeves server development toolkit. Here is a brief
description of the workings of a generic Jeeves server, followed
by a description of the specific workings of the HTTP server.
<P>
An object of the <TT>sun.server.Server</TT>
class waits in a loop for connection requests. Connections are
placed on a queue while the server determines if there are handler
objects of the <TT>sun.server.ServerHandler</TT>
class available in the handler thread pool.
<P>
If none are available and the maximum number of handler threads
has not been reached, the server starts a new handler thread.
If, on the other hand, the number of handlers exceeds the minimum
needed, and some have been idle for a period longer than the specified
timeout parameter, the idle handlers expire.
<P>
In the case of the HTTP server, once the server receives an HTTP
request, it is queued for servicing by the pool of HTTP server
handler threads. The HTTP handler then authorizes and applies
name translation rules to the request, and passes the request
on to the appropriate servlet.
<P>
Servlets provide the core function of the Jeeves HTTP server,
as well as providing a means for extending that function. The
HTTP server includes a set of core servlets that provide common
Web server functions.
<P>
For instance, the <TT>FileServlet</TT>
fulfills HTTP <TT>GET</TT> requests,
returning the requested file to the client. The <TT>Invoker</TT>
servlet is used to dynamically invoke servlets that have been
explicity requested by a client using an URL of the form:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>http://ServerHostName/servlet/&lt;servletName&gt;</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>Invoker</TT> supports only
local servlets but will soon be able to dynamically load servlets
from across a network. The <TT>SSInclude</TT>
servlet parses server-side include files (files with an .shtml
extension) and calls any servlet that was referenced.
<P>
The <TT>CgiServlet</TT> provides backward
compatibility for the large body of existing CGI programs. The
<TT>ImageMapServlet</TT> uses server-side
image maps. Finally, there is the <TT>Admin</TT>
Servlet that works together with the Admin applet to help with
administrative tasks (you'll learn more about this in the next
section).
<H3><A NAME="InstallingandRunningtheJeevesHTTPServer">
Installing and Running the Jeeves HTTP Server</A></H3>
<P>
First, you need a host that has the Java runtime installed. Once
you have an appropriate host, installing Jeeves is simply a matter
of unzipping the distribution and running the httpd program found
in the bin directory under the main installation directory. You
can test whether the server is up by pointing a Web browser at
the following URL:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>http://ServerHostName:8888/</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The server's default port is 8888; you will learn how to change
this and other defaults in this chapter.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="AdministeringtheJeevesWebServer">
Administering the Jeeves Web Server</A></H3>
<P>
There are two ways to administer the Jeeves Web server. You can
use the administration Web page, which includes an applet that
enables you to modify many of the server's parameters dynamically.
Or you can change the configuration files, listed in Table 24.1,
by hand.
<P>
You can adjust many parameters. Some of these changes take effect
immediately and others do not take effect until the server is
restarted. In the following section, you will proceed step-by-step
through the administration process, using both the administration
Web page and the configuration files.<BR>

<P>
<H4>Administering Jeeves from a Java-Enabled Browser</H4>
<P>
You can manage the Jeeves Web server remotely using any Java-enabled
Web browser. Once the server is running, you can access the administration
Web page by pointing your browser at the following URL:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>http://ServerHostName:8888/admin/admin.html</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You are prompted for a user name and password. The default administration
account name and password are <TT><B>admin</B></TT>.
Once authorized, you see the page shown in Figure 24.1.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-1.gif"><B>Figure 24.1 : </B><I>HTTP configuration using the Admin applet</I>.</A>
<P>
The window on the left includes a list of administrative tasks,
including HTTP configuration, log configuration, file aliasing,
servlet aliasing, servlet loading, MIME configuration, user configuration,
group configuration, access control list (ACL) configuration,
and resource protection.
<H4>Modifying Basic Web Server Parameters</H4>
<P>
Jeeves has many tunable parameters. Figure 24.1 shows the parameters
you can modify from the administration Web page. There are other
properties, such as the server user (UNIX version only) and server
host name, that can be changed only from the httpd.properties
file.
<P>
Jeeves lets you set the number of handler threads that are started
and how long an idle thread remains before being destroyed. In
the httpd.properities file, you'll find the following thread properties:
<TT>server.min.threads</TT>, <TT>server.max.threads</TT>,
and <TT>server.timeout</TT>.
<P>
Jeeves uses connection <TT>keepalive</TT>
to improve performance by keeping the connections to client browsers
open even after the request has been fulfilled. This reduces the
overhead of bringing the connection up and down for multiple requests
from the same client.
<P>
The <TT>keepalive</TT> count property
determines the number of hits from a single client that are received
before the connection is brought down. The <TT>keepalive</TT>
timeout determines the time in seconds the connection stays up
after a request has been fulfilled.
<H4>Configuring Web Server Logging</H4>
<P>
You can specify where log files are stored and the level of logging
detail for the Access, Error, and Event logs. These changes are
made from the Log Configuration screen (see Figure 24.2) or the
httpd.properties file.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-2.gif"><B>Figure 24.2 : </B><I>Log Configuration using the Admin applet</I>.</A>
<P>
The Access log is in Common Log format, which lets you use existing
log-analyzing scripts on them. All the log files reside in the
$JEEVES-HOME/logs directory.
<H4>Creating File Aliases</H4>
<P>
You can map virtual paths in the requested URL to an arbitrary
real path name on the server's disk. These changes take effect
immediately if done from the File Aliasing screen (see Figure
24.3); otherwise, you can make the changes to the alias.properties
file.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-3.gif"><B>Figure 24.3 : </B><I>File aliasing using the Admin applet</I>.</A>
<H4>Configuring MIME</H4>
<P>
The mime.properties file and the Mime Section of the administration
Web page allows you to map Mime types to file extensions. This
information is sent from the server to the client browser.
<P>
The browser uses this information to figure out what to do with
the file it is about to receive from the server. For example,
in the case of a file with a .mov extension, the browser should
start up a QuickTime viewer. You can also change the mime.properties
file by hand.
<H4>Loading Servlets into the Web Server</H4>
<P>
To execute servlets, you must map the servlet name to a class
that lies somewhere in the server's <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>
environment variable. You can do this from the Servlet Loading
screen of the administration Web page (see Figure 24.4).
<P>
<A HREF="f24-4.gif"><B>Figure 24.4 : </B><I>Servlet loading using the Admin applet</I>.</A>
<P>
Remote servlets can also be loaded by specifying their URL to
the location field of the administration page.
<P>
When you use the Web page, the changes take effect immediately.
When you use the servlets.properties file, you can map the servlet
called <TT>myservlet</TT> to the <TT>MyServlet</TT>
class in the <TT>mypackage</TT> package
with the following entry:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
myservlet.code=mypackage.MyServlet
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When you change the servlet.properties file, the changes do not
take effect until the server is restarted. You can now invoke
<TT>myservlet</TT> with the following
URL:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>http://&lt;server_host&gt;/servlet/myservlet</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The virtual path <TT><B>/servlet</B></TT>
is mapped to the Invoker, which then calls the referenced servlet.
<H4>Creating Servlet Aliases</H4>
<P>
Servlets can also be mapped to arbitrary document names. When
you use the Servlet Aliasing screen (see Figure 24.5), all changes
are dynamic. Otherwise, change the rules.properties file. Again,
changes to the configuration files take effect after the server
has been restarted.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-5.gif"><B>Figure 24.5 : </B><I>Servlet aliasing using the Admin applet</I>.</A>
<P>
To map <TT>myservlet</TT> to <TT>myservlet.html</TT>,
put the following line into the rules.properties file:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
/myservlet.html=myservlet
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A NAME="HTTPServerSecurity">
HTTP Server Security</A></H3>
<P>
Jeeves uses an extensible, access-control list framework for controlling
requests for files and servlets. Only the Basic HTTP authentication
scheme is allowed, but Jeeves accepts the configuration of different
authentication schemes when they become available.
<P>
Access control lists can be associated with any file, directory,
or servlet. If a file or directory is not explicitly protected
by an ACL, it inherits the protection of its parent directory.
<P>
If there is no ACL for the entire directory structure, access
is granted. If a servlet is not explicitly protected by an ACL,
a default is used. If it doesn't exist, access is granted. Servlets
can also use their own access-control list, using the security
classes available in Jeeves.
<P>
Jeeves also makes use of security realms. Realms are used to set
broad security policies. When users, groups, or access-control
lists are added to the Web server, they are assigned to a realm.
<P>
People who have common security needs can be put into a Single
realm, such as the adminRealm. When you want to protect a resource,
you associate it with an access-control list in a realm. Jeeves
comes with two built-in realms, adminRealm and defaultRealm.
<H4>Servlet Security</H4>
<P>
The four basic types of servlets are core servlets, local servlets,
signed network servlets, and unsigned network servlets. These
servlets are treated differently with respect to security.
<P>
The core servlets and local servlets are thought to be trusted
and are granted full access to the server's resources. Signed
network servlets are granted a limited subset of privileges, as
determined by the site administrator. Unsigned servlets are not
trusted and are only executed in a restrictive environment, called
the <TT><I>server sandbox</I></TT>.
<H4>Protecting Web Resources</H4>
<P>
Using the Resource Protection section of the administration Web
page (see Figure 24.6), you can assign schemes and realms to Web
resources. These resources include documents and servlets.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-6.gif"><B>Figure 24.6 : </B><I>Protecting resources with the administration
Web page</I>.</A>
<H4>Adding Users to Security Realms</H4>
<P>
You can add users to different realms. The easiest way to add
users is through the Users screen of the administration Web page
(see Figure 24.7). Simply select the realm, and enter the user's
name and password.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-7.gif"><B>Figure 24.7 : </B><I>Adding a user to a realm with the Admin
applet</I>.</A>
<H4>Creating Groups of Users</H4>
<P>
You can group together users who should share the same privileges
using the Groups section of the administration Web page (see Figure
24.8). Select the realm and group you want to change and enter
the user you want to add. You can also create new groups by entering
the new group name in the field above the user name.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-8.gif"><B>Figure 24.8 : </B><I>Adding a user to a group with the Admin
applet</I>.</A>
<H4>Creating and Modifying ACLs</H4>
<P>
You can create new ACLs in a realm or add entries to an existing
realm from the ACL screen on the administration Web page (see
Figure 24.9). To add an entry to an existing ACL, select it from
the center window and click the Add ACL Entry button.
<P>
<A HREF="f24-9.gif"><B>Figure 24.9 : </B><I>Creating and modifying ACLs with the administration
Web page</I>.</A>
<P>
A new window appears. On the far left is a select box with a plus
sign and a minus sign. Choose the plus sign to grant privileges
or choose the minus sign to restrict them.
<P>
The next select box lets you choose whether you are modifying
the privileges of a group or of an individual user. There is a
text field to enter the group or user name. Finally, select the
privileges you want (such as <TT>GET</TT>,
<TT>POST</TT>, or <TT>PUT</TT>)
for that user or group.
<P>
To add a new ACL, choose the Create ACL button. A box appears
prompting you for the ACL name. To delete an ACL, select it from
the list and choose the Delete ACL button.
<H2><A NAME="ExtendingJeevesFunctionalitywithServlets"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Extending Jeeves' Functionality with Servlets</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Now that you have a basic understanding of the HTTP server architecture
and are familiar with the administrative design, you can move
on to extending the server's function with servlets.
<P>
Creating servlets is like creating applets. Servlets are basically
applets without graphical front ends. Both servlets and applets
can be loaded dynamically from across a network.
<P>
Both applets and servlets are small programs that extend the function
of a browser or server, respectively. Both can run on any platform
that supports Java and the applet or servlet APIs, respectively.
<P>
In this part of the chapter, you are introduced to the Servlet
API, and you'll write some generic servlets. You then learn about
the additional classes provided by the Jeeves server development
toolkit that make extending Web server functions even simpler.
<P>
Next, you build a servlet that accesses any database that supports
the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) interface, letting users
insert data and search for data from a Web page.
<P>
Finally, you use servlets to build a simple example of an autonomous
agent system. You'll write a couple of simple agency servlets
that provide an environment for roaming autonomous agents.
<P>
You'll create an agent that is transported to a remote agency
where it gathers some information from a JDBC database. The agency
asks the agent where it lives and sends it home.
<P>
The agent's home agency stores the agent in a file for later processing.
Finally, you'll restore the agent and extract the information
it has gathered.
<H3><A NAME="EmployingtheServletAPI">
Employing the Servlet API</A></H3>
<P>
The Servlet API is Sun's proposed standard for extending Web server
function with Java. Other servers that have Java APIs include
Netscape, Oracle, and the World Wide Web Consortium's Jigsaw server,
which, like Jeeves, is written entirely in Java.
<P>
Each of the above servers uses a different API. This reduces Java's
inherent platform independence by requiring developers to write
different Java programs for each of these servers.
<P>
A single Java Web server API will greatly simplify development
of Web services. It is not yet clear whether servlets will become
the standard that applets have become. But servlets have a lot
going for them, not the least of which is the support of Sun,
the developer of Java.
<P>
The classes associated with the servlet API are in a single package,
<TT>java.servlet</TT>. This package
includes four Java interfaces: <TT>ServletContext</TT>,
<TT>ServletRequest</TT>, <TT>ServletResponse</TT>,
and <TT>ServletStub</TT>; and three
classes: <TT>Servlet</TT>, <TT>ServletInputStream</TT>,
and <TT>ServletOutputStream</TT>.
<P>
The server developer must use the four interfaces to make the
server comply with the servlet API. You then use the server's
implementations of these interfaces along with the <TT>Servlet</TT>,
<TT>ServletInputStream</TT>, and <TT>ServletOutputStream</TT>
classes to write servlets.
<P>
In this section, you learn the basics behind the classes and interfaces
that make up the servlet package.
<H4>Extending the <TT>Servlet</TT>
Class</H4>
<P>
The <TT>Servlet</TT> class provides
the basic function necessary to create servlets. This class includes
the methods shown in Table 24.2.<BR>

<P>
<P>
The first step in writing Servlets is extending the <TT>Servlet</TT>
class and overriding the <TT>service</TT>
method. The following servlet prints &quot;Hello World&quot; to
the client browser.
<P>
The first step is to get the <TT>OutputStream</TT>
from the <TT>ServletResponse</TT>
object and create a <TT>PrintStream</TT>
with it. Next, you set the response status to <TT>OK</TT>
using the static variable <TT>SC_OK</TT>
from the <TT>ServletResponse</TT>
class.
<P>
Then, you set the content type of the response to text/plain and

After you compile the class, load it into the HTTP server using
either the servlet.properties file or the servlet loading screen
of the administration Web page, as was discussed in the first
part of this chapter. You can access the servlet with the following
URL:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><B>http://&lt;server&gt;/servlet/&lt;servlet_name&gt;</B></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
where <TT>&lt;servlet_name&gt;</TT>
is the name you assigned to your servlet when you loaded it into
the HTTP server.
<H4>Sending Information with the <TT>ServletResponse</TT>
Interface</H4>
<P>
The <TT>ServletResponse</TT> interface
allows you to send information to the client's browser. It includes
methods for getting an output stream directed at the client, setting
the header information, sending errors to the client, and setting
the status of the response. Table 24.3 shows more of <TT>ServletResponse</TT>'s
methods.
<P>
<TT>ServletResponse</TT> also includes
a list of static integer variables used in setting the response
status. The previous example used the <TT>SC_OK</TT>
variable. Other responses include <TT>SC_CREATED</TT>,
<TT>SC_NO_CONTENT</TT>, <TT>SC_MOVED_PERMANENTLY</TT>,
<TT>SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY</TT>, <TT>SC_BAD_REQUEST</TT>,
<TT>SC_UNATHORIZED</TT>, <TT>SC_FORBIDDEN</TT>,
<TT>SC_NOT_FOUND</TT>. For a complete

<H4>Getting Information with the <TT>ServletContext</TT>
Interface</H4>
<P>
The <TT>getServletContext</TT> method
from the <TT>Servlet</TT> class returns
a <TT>ServletContext</TT>. This object
lets you find out information about the environment in which the
servlet is running.
<P>
The <TT>getServerInfo</TT> method
returns the name and version of the server running. The <TT>getServlet</TT>
method returns a servlet with its name, and the <TT>getServlets</TT>
method returns an enumeration of all the available servlets in
this context.
<H3><A NAME="UsingtheJeevesDevelopmentToolkit">
Using the Jeeves Development Toolkit</A></H3>
<P>
In addition to the servlet API, Jeeves includes additional classes
that simplify the development of Web services. For example, there
are several prebuilt servlets that extend the function of the
generic <TT>Servlet</TT> class. These
include a form servlet that processes HTML form input and a filter
interface that lets you embed servlets in HTML pages using server-side
includes.
<P>
Sun also includes several sample servlets to get you started.
Other classes in the toolkit let you generate HTML, set servlet
security, and do other useful tasks.
<H4>Processing Form Input with the <TT>FormServlet</TT>
</H4>
<P>
The <TT>FormServlet</TT> greatly simplifies
the processing of HTML form input. To process data from a form,
extend the <TT>FormServlet</TT> class
and override the <TT>sendResponse</TT>
method.
<P>
The <TT>sendResponse</TT> method doesn't
take a <TT>ServletRequest</TT> object
as an argument. Instead, it gets a hash table containing the values
from the HTML form. The following example shows how to get the
value from the form field called <TT>field_name</TT>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
 Public class SimpleFormServlet extends FormServlet {
     public void sendResponse(ServletResponse res, Hashtable table) {
     String field_value = table.get(&quot;field_name&quot;);
     ...
     }
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Using the Filter Interface to Embed Servlets in HTML Pages
</H4>
<P>
Using the Jeeves Filter interface, you can create servlets that
can be embedded in HTML pages using a server-side include statement.
The following server-side include statement calls <TT>myServlet</TT>
and passes the <TT>name1</TT> and
<TT>name2</TT> parameters to it in
the form of a hash table:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
&lt;SERVLET CODE=&quot;myServlet&quot; name1=&quot;value1&quot; name2=&quot;value2&quot;&gt;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The following servlet inserts the date into the Web page it is
embedded in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
import java.servlet.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class SSIServlet extends Servlet implements Filter {
     public void service(InputStream is, OutputStream os, Hashtable params)
     throws java.io.IOException
     {
     Date now = new Date();
     PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(os);
     ps.println(today);
     ps.flush();
     }
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Notice that the <TT>service</TT> method
accepts different arguments from normal. Instead of <TT>ServletRequest</TT>
and <TT>ServletResponse</TT>, the
arguments to service are an <TT>InputStream</TT>,
<TT>OutputStream</TT>, and <TT>Hashtable</TT>.
The hash table is used to store the parameters passed to the servlet
by the server-side include statement.
<H4>Generating HTML with the Jeeves HTML Classes</H4>
<P>
Sun provides a package of classes that generate HTML. The package
includes the <TT>HtmlContainer</TT>
and <TT>HtmlElement</TT> interfaces,
as well as the <TT>HtmlContainerImpl</TT>,
<TT>HtmlPage</TT>, <TT>HtmlTag</TT>,
<TT>HtmlTagPair</TT>, and <TT>HtmlText</TT>
classes.
<P>
Start by creating a new <TT>HtmlPage</TT>
object. Then, using the <TT>addTag</TT>,
<TT>addTagPair</TT>, and <TT>addText</TT>
methods, insert the necessary HTML. The following example shows
a simple use of these classes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
import java.servlet.*;
import sun.server.html
import java.io.*;

public class HtmlServlet extends Servlet {
     pubic service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res)
     throws Exception {
     res.setContentType(&quot;text/html&quot;);
     res.setStatus(ServletResponse.SC_OK);
     OutputStream os = res.getOutputStream();
     
     HtmlPage page = new HtmlPage(&quot;A Simple HTML page&quot;);
     page.addTagPair(&quot;H1&quot;, &quot;This is a Simple HTML Page&quot;);
     page.addTag(&quot;p&quot;);
     page.addText(&quot;This page was generated by the sun.server.html package&quot;);
     
     page.write(os);
     os.flush();
     }

In this section, you build a Servlet that processes an HTML form
and either searches for or inserts data into a JDBC database.
This servlet could be used by a site to register new users, process
orders, survey users, or enable users to search one of your publicly
accessible databases.
<H3><A NAME="GettingtheInformationfromtheUsers">
Getting the Information from the Users</A></H3>
<P>
The first step is to process the form data with a <TT>FormServlet</TT>.
This is a generic registration form that asks the user's name,
title, company, and address. The following is a <TT>sendResponse</TT>
method that returns the information supplied by the user in an
HTML table:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ConnectingYourServlettoaJDBCDatabase">
Connecting Your Servlet to a JDBC Database</A></H3>
<P>
The next step is to connect to a SQL database. The Java Database
Connectivity package makes this possible. The servlet also uses
a very simple SQL generator.
<P>
The <TT>generator</TT> class takes
an object of the <TT>DBRecord</TT>
class as an argument and returns a string containing SQL commands.
<TT>DBRecord</TT> is a container class
that holds the table's name, its primary key, and the names and
values of the fields to be changed.
<P>
To increase the performance of the database queries, the servlet
connects to the database in its <TT>init()</TT>
method. This makes the servlet connect to the database as soon
as it is loaded.
<P>
By telling Jeeves to load the servlet when the server starts up,
you can reduce the overhead associated with reestablishing the
connection for each request. See the previous section on loading
servlets to learn how to make Jeeves load the servlet at startup.

Building a Simple Autonomous Agent System with Jeeves</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
This example shows how servlets can be used to create an environment
in which small, self-contained Java programs can roam the Internet,
gathering and processing information before returning home for
debriefing. This example has five components: the agent, the remote
agency servlet, the home agency servlet, the agent launcher, and
the agent debriefing program.
<P>
The agent launcher instructs the agent of the information it is
to retrieve from a particular JDBC database and then transports
it to the destination. The remote agency servlet provides an environment
where the agent can execute its <TT>run</TT>
method, which then queries the specified database. 
<P>
After that, the remote agency asks the agent where it lives and
then sends it on its way. The home agency servlet then accepts
the agent and stores it in a file for later debriefing. Finally,
the agent debriefing program restores the agent and requests the
information it was sent to retrieve.
<P>
This is a simple system designed only for illustration. A real
system needs to use strict security measures, which Jeeves does
provide through a servlet-specific, access-control list.
<P>
A real system also needs a way of advertising services that are
accessible to agents. This way, agents can find new services themselves.
<H3><A NAME="UsingObjectSerializationtoTransportAgentsAcrosstheInternet">
Using Object Serialization to Transport Agents Across the
Internet</A></H3>
<P>
Java's object serialization provides transportation for your agent.
Object serialization is the process of turning any Java object
or graph of objects (an object and all the objects it is made
up of) into a stream of information. This stream can be transported
using any <TT>OutputStream</TT> or
<TT>InputStream</TT> and restored
to its original state when it reaches the other side.
<P>
Object serialization can be used to give persistence to an object
by serializing an object into a file for later retrieval. This
is done to the <TT>JDBCAgent</TT>
in the following example.
<P>
Serializing an object is as easy as creating an <TT>ObjectOutputStream</TT>
and calling its <TT>writeObject</TT>
method with the object to be serialized as the argument.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ObjectOutputStream oos = ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

Deserializing an object is just as straightforward. First, create

call its <TT>readObject</TT> method
with the object to be deserialized as the argument.

Start by building the remote agency. The <TT>RemoteAgencyServlet</TT>
class extends the <TT>Servlet</TT>
class. Its sole purpose in Listing 24.3 is to deserialize the
agent, execute the agent's <TT>run</TT>

Again, in a real system, you need to use careful security procedures.
