ACORBA server has objects whose methods are invoked remotely by
its clients. A single server can have any number of objects, and
can activate and deactivate objects at any time. An active object
is visible to the clients, whereas an inactive object cannot be
accessed by clients.

Creating a Basic CORBA Server</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The interface between the ORB and the implementation of a server
is called a <I>skeleton</I>. A skeleton for an IDL interface gets
information from the ORB, invokes the appropriate server method,
and sends the results back to the ORB.
<P>
You normally don't have to write the skeleton itself; you just
supply the implementation of the remote methods. Figure 19.1 illustrates
the flow of a method invocation through a skeleton to your implementation.

You will see how to create a server for this interface in both
JavaIDL and VisiBroker.

<P>
When an IDL struct is turned into a Java class, it does not have
custom <TT>hashCode</TT> and <TT>equals</TT>
methods. This means that two instances of this class having identical
data are not equal.
<P>
If you want to add custom methods to these structs, you have to
create a separate class and define methods to convert from one
class to the other.
<P>
In <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A>, &quot;Creating 3-Tier Distributed Applications
with RMI,&quot; the RMI-based banking application defines an <TT>Account</TT>
class that has its own <TT>hashCode</TT>
and <TT>equals</TT> methods. This
allows it to be stored in a hash table.
<P>
The following code shows the two methods that need to be added
to the <TT>Account</TT> class to convert
to and from <TT>AccountInfo</TT> objects.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// Allow this object to be created from an AccountInfo instance

        public Account(AccountInfo acct)

                this.password = acct.password;

        }

// Convert this object to an AccountInfo instance

<H3><A NAME="VisiBrokerSkeletons">
VisiBroker Skeletons</A></H3>
<P>
VisiBroker implements skeletons in a traditional way. When you
generate your skeletons and stubs for an IDL module, it generates
an abstract skeleton class.
<P>
This class has all the code to communicate with the ORB and to
invoke the remote methods. It leaves the remote methods themselves
as abstract methods.
<P>
When you use the remote methods, you create a subclass of the
skeleton class and use those abstract methods. The name of the
skeleton class generated for an IDL interface, at least for VisiBroker,
is the name of the interface, prefaced by <TT>_sk_</TT>.
<P>
Every object that uses a CORBA interface in VisiBroker must identify
itself by a name. The constructor for the skeleton class sends
this name to the ORB itself.
<P>
When you create a subclass of the skeleton, you must create a
constructor that passes a name up to the superclass, for example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public class BankingImpl extends _sk_Banking
{
     public BankingImpl(String bankingObjectName)
     {
          super(bankingObjectName);
     // other initialization code here
     }
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The implementation of the skeleton methods is straightforward.
In fact, you can use the implementation of the <TT>BankingImpl</TT>
class from <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A>, changing only the <TT>java.rmi.RemoteException</TT>
exceptions to <TT>CORBA.SystemException</TT>.
<P>
The following code fragment is an example of one of the methods
from the <TT>BankingImpl</TT> for
VisiBroker:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// getBalance returns the amount of money in the account (in cents).
// If the account is invalid, it throws an InvalidAccountException

     public int getBalance(AccountInfo accountInfo)
     throws CORBA.SystemException, InvalidAccountException
     {

// Fetch the account from the table
          Integer balance = (Integer) accountTable.get(
               new Account(accountInfo));

// If the account wasn't there, throw an exception
          if (balance == null) {
               throw new InvalidAccountException(accountInfo);
          }

// Return the account's balance
          return balance.intValue();
     }
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you create an object that uses a remote interface, you need
a program that creates instances of these objects so the clients
can use them. To do this, you must first initialize the VisiBroker
ORB with the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
CORBA.ORB orb = CORBA.ORB.init();
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Next, you must create an instance of the Basic Object Adapter,
or BOA. The BOA is a standard CORBA object used to communicate
with the ORB. 
<P>
It was intended for systems where the ORB and the server are separate
programs or even on separate machines. The BOA has methods for
activating and deactivating objects, and for activating and deactivating
the entire server.
<P>
You create an instance of a BOA with the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
CORBA.BOA boa = orb.BOA_init();
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Next, create an instance of your implementation object. In this
case, the implementation object is the <TT>BankingImpl</TT>
object.
<P>
While you are instantiating a <TT>BankingImpl</TT>
object, you want to refer to it as an instance of the <TT>Banking</TT>
object, as far as the BOA is concerned, so you should store the
new object in a variable of type <TT>Banking</TT>.
<P>
Also, when you create the implementation, you must give it the
name that the other clients will use to access it. In this case,
the name is <TT>Bank</TT>. You create
the instance with the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Banking banking = new BankingImpl(&quot;Bank&quot;);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Even though you have created an implementation object, the ORB
still does not know about it. You must identify the object to
the BOA by calling the <TT>obj_is_ready</TT>
method:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
boa.obj_is_ready(banking);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If you have more than one implementation object, you should identify
them all to the BOA at this point. Once all the objects have been
identified, call the BOA's <TT>impl_is_ready</TT>
to tell the ORB that everything is ready to go:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
boa.impl_is_ready();
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When you have called <TT>impl_is_ready</TT>,
your server is ready to go, and clients can begin connecting to
it.
<P>
Listing 19.2 shows a startup object that initializes the ORB,
creates an instance of the <TT>BankingImpl</TT>
class, and activates it using the BOA.

<H3><A NAME="UsingtheVisiBrokerTIEInterface">
Using the VisiBroker TIE Interface</A></H3>
<P>
The traditional approach of using an abstract skeleton class with
an implementation subclass works well for many situations. In
fact, in C++ you may never have any problems with it, since C++
allows multiple inheritance.
<P>
In Java, however, you can run into some hairy problems using this
method. You may want to create a remote object that is a subclass
of a non-CORBA object. Using the normal skeleton class provided
by VisiBroker uses up your one permitted inheritance.
<P>
The VisiBroker TIE interface addresses this problem. The concept
of the TIE is common in several ORBs and is sometimes called <I>delegation</I>.
<P>
TIE doesn't stand for anything. It refers to the idea that it
ties a CORBA object to a non-CORBA object, providing remote access
to the non-CORBA object.
<P>
In the regular skeleton implementation, the skeleton <I>is</I>
the implementation. In the TIE implementation, the skeleton and
the implementation are separate objects.
<P>
VisiBroker's implementation of the TIE in Java is quite simple.
When you create Java files from IDL, VisiBroker creates a Java
interface for each interface you define in IDL. The name of the
Java interface is the name of the IDL interface with the word
Operations appended to it.
<P>
For instance, the IDL interface <TT>Banking</TT>
would generate a Java interface called <TT>BankingOperations</TT>.
VisiBroker also generates a skeleton TIE implementation, whose
name is the name of the IDL interface, prefaced by _tie_, like
<TT>_tie_Banking</TT>.
<P>
Unlike the normal skeleton class, the TIE skeleton class is not
an abstract class. Instead, it uses the methods in the IDL interface.
<P>
All these methods do, however, is invoke identical methods in
an instance of <TT>BankingOperations</TT>.
In other words, the TIE skeleton class works like a pass-thru.
<P>
Figure 19.2 illustrates the relationship between a TIE skeleton
and an object using the <TT>BankingOperations</TT>
interface.
<P>
<A HREF="f19-2.gif"><B>Figure 19.2 : </B><I>The TIE skeleton invokes implementation
methods in another object</I>.</A>
<P>
When you create an implementation object for a TIE interface,
it does not have to be a subclass of the skeleton. In fact, it
shouldn't be.
<P>
Instead, it must use an <TT>Operations</TT>
interface (<TT>BankingOperations</TT>,
for example). The only link that the implementation has to CORBA
is that each method in the <TT>Operations</TT>
interface can throw the <TT>CORBA.SystemException</TT>
exception.
<P>
Unlike the regular skeleton implementation, the constructor for
the TIE implementation object does not have to accept the object's
name. You can use the empty constructor if you like.
<P>
The only difference in start-up between the regular skeleton implementation
and the TIE implementation is that for the TIE implementation,
you first create the TIE implementation object, and then you create
an instance of the TIE skeleton, passing it the implementation
object.
<P>
The following code fragment creates a TIE implementation of the
<TT>Banking</TT> interface, followed
by the TIE skeleton for that interface:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
BankingTieImpl impl = new BankingTieImpl();
Banking banking = new _tie_Banking(impl, &quot;Bank&quot;);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As you can see, the object's name is passed to the constructor
for the TIE skeleton, not to the TIE implementation.
<H3><A NAME="JavaIDLSkeletons">
JavaIDL Skeletons</A></H3>
<P>
JavaIDL doesn't even bother with an abstract skeleton class. Instead,
it always generates a TIE interface for every class, although
the JavaIDL specification never uses the term <I>TIE</I>.
<P>
Like VisiBroker, JavaIDL creates an <TT>Operations</TT>
interface that has Java versions of the methods defined in the
IDL interface. The only difference between the interface created
by JavaIDL and the interface created by VisiBroker is the name
of the CORBA system exception. JavaIDL calls it <TT>sunw.corba.SystemException</TT>.
<P>
The implementation object you create does not use the <TT>Operations</TT>
interface directly. Instead, it uses the <TT>Servant</TT>
interface, which extends the <TT>Operations</TT>
interface. For example, your implementation for the <TT>Banking</TT>
interface might be declared as
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public class BankingImpl implements BankingServant
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Although JavaIDL is intended to be Sun's recommendation for mapping
IDL into Java, it was released with a lightweight ORB called the
Door ORB. This ORB provides just enough functionality to get clients
and servers talking to each other, but not much more.
<P>
Depending on the ORB, the initialization varies, as does the activation
of the objects. For the Door ORB distributed with JavaIDL, you
initialize the ORB with the following line:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
sunw.door.Orb.initialize(servicePort);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>servicePort</TT> parameter
you pass to the ORB is the port number it should use when listening
for incoming clients. It must be an integer value. Your clients
must use this port number when connecting to your server.
<P>
After you initialize the orb, you can instantiate your implementation
object. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
BankingImpl impl = new BankingImpl();
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Next, you create the skeleton, passing it the implementation object:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
BankingRef server = BankingSkeleton.createRef(impl);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Finally, you activate the server by publishing the name of the
object:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
sunw.door.Orb.publish(&quot;Bank&quot;, server);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="CreatingCallbacksinCORBA"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Creating Callbacks in CORBA</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Callbacks are a handy mechanism in distributed computing. You
use them whenever your client wants to be notified of some event
but doesn't want to sit and poll the server to see if the event
has occurred yet.
<P>
In a regular Java program, you'd just create a callback interface
and pass the server an object that uses the callback interface.
When the event occurs, the server invokes a method in the callback
object.
<P>
As it turns out, callbacks are just that easy in CORBA. You define
a callback interface in your IDL file and then create a method
in the server's interface that takes the callback interface as
a parameter. The following IDL file defines a server interface
and a callback interface:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
module callbackDemo
{
     interface callbackInterface {
          void doNotify(in string whatHappened);
     };

     interface serverInterface {
          void setCallback(in callbackInterface callMe);
     };
};
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Under JavaIDL, the <TT>setCallback</TT>
method would be defined as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
void setCallback(callbackDemo.callbackInterfaceRef callMe)
    throws sunw.corba.SystemException;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you have the <TT>callbackDemo.callbackInterfaceRef</TT>
object, you can invoke its <TT>whatHappened</TT>
method at any time. At this point, the client and server are on
a peer-to-peer level. They are each other's client and server.
<H2><A NAME="WrappingCORBAAroundanExistingObject"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Wrapping CORBA Around an Existing Object</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
When you create CORBA implementation objects, you are tying that
object to a CORBA implementation. Even if you use the TIE interface
in your ORB, your methods still can throw the CORBA <TT>SystemException</TT>
exception.
<P>
This is not the ideal situation. Even though JavaIDL and VisiBroker
are similar, you still have to make minor changes when going from
one to the other. If the conversion is a one-time thing, that
may not be a big deal.
<P>
If, on the other hand, you have to maintain multiple versions
of a complex object, you don't want to keep multiple copies of
the actual implementation code.
<P>
You can solve this problem, but it takes a little extra work up
front. First, concentrate on using the object you want, without
using CORBA, RMI, or any other remote interface mechanism. 
<P>
This is the one copy you use across all your implementations.
This object, or set of objects, can define its own types, exceptions,
and interfaces.
<P>
Next, to make this object available remotely, define an IDL interface
that is as close to the object's interface as you can get. There
may be cases where they won't match exactly, but you can take
care of that.
<P>
Once you generate the Java classes from the IDL definition, create
an implementation that simply invokes methods on the real implementation
object. This is essentially the same as a TIE interface, with
one major exception: the implementation class has no knowledge
of CORBA.
<P>
You can even use this technique to provide multiple ways to access
a remote object. Figure 19.3 shows a diagram of the various ways
you might provide access to your implementation object.
<P>
<A HREF="f19-3.gif"><B>Figure 19.3 : </B><I>A single object can be accessed by many
types of remote object systems</I>.</A>
<P>
Although this may sound simple, it has some additional complexities
that you must address. If your implementation object defines its
own exceptions, you must map those exceptions to CORBA exceptions.
You must also map between Java objects and CORBA-defined objects.
<P>
Once again, the banking interface is a good starting point for
illustrating the problems and solutions in separating the application
from CORBA.
<P>
The original banking interface is defined with a hierarchy of
exceptions, a generic <TT>BankingException</TT>,
with <TT>InsufficientFundsException</TT>
and <TT>InvalidAccountException</TT>
as subclasses. This poses a problem in CORBA, since exceptions
aren't inherited.
<P>
You must define a <TT>BankingException</TT>
exception in your IDL file, this way:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
exception BankingException {};
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In addition, since you probably want the banking application itself
to be in the banking package, change the IDL module name to <TT>remotebanking</TT>.
<P>
The implementation for the <TT>Banking</TT>
interface in the remotebanking module must do two kinds of mapping.
First, it must convert instances of the <TT>Account</TT>
object to instances of the <TT>AccountInfo</TT>
object. 
<P>
This may seem like a pain and, frankly, it is, but it's a necessary
pain. If you start to intermingle the classes defined by CORBA
with the real implementation of the application, you end up having
to carry the CORBA portions along with the application, even if
you don't use CORBA.
<H3><A NAME="MappingtoandfromCORBADefinedTypes">
Mapping to and from CORBA-Defined Types</A></H3>
<P>
You can define static methods to handle the conversion from the
application data types to the CORBA-defined data types. For example,
the banking application defines an <TT>Account</TT>
object. 
<P>
The remotebanking module defines this object as <TT>AccountInfo</TT>.
You can convert between the two with the following methods:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// Create a banking.Account from an AccountInfo object

public static banking.Account makeAccount(AccountInfo info)
{
        return new banking.Account(info.id, info.password,
                info.which);
}

// Create an AccountInfo object from a banking.Account object

public static AccountInfo makeAccountInfo(banking.Account account)
{
        return new AccountInfo(account.id, account.password,
                account.which);
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Your remote implementation of the banking interface needs access
to the real implementation, so the constructor for the <TT>RemoteBankingImpl</TT>
object needs a reference to the <TT>banking.BankingImpl</TT>
object:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
protected banking.BankingImpl impl;

public RemoteBankingImpl(banking.BankingImpl impl)
{
        this.impl = impl;
}
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A NAME="CreatingRemoteMethodWrappers">
Creating Remote Method Wrappers</A></H3>
<P>
Now all your remote methods have to do is convert any incoming
<TT>AccountInfo</TT> objects to <TT>banking.Account</TT>
objects, catch any exceptions, and throw the proper remote exceptions.
Here is the implementation of the remote <TT>withdraw</TT>
method:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// call the withdraw function in the real implementation, catching
// any exceptions and throwing the equivalent CORBA exception

public synchronized void withdraw(AccountInfo accountInfo, int amount)
throws sunw.corba.SystemException, InvalidAccountException,
        InsufficientFundsException, BankingException
{

        try {

// Call the real withdraw method, converting the accountInfo object
// to a banking.Account object first

                impl.withdraw( makeAccount(accountInfo), amount);

        } catch (banking.InvalidAccountException excep) {

// The banking.InvalidAccountException contains an Account object.
// Convert it to an AccountInfo object when throwing the CORBA exception

                throw new InvalidAccountException(
                        makeAccountInfo(excep.account));

        } catch (banking.InsufficientFundsException nsf) {
                throw new InsufficientFundsException();
        } catch (banking.BankingException e) {

Although it would be nice if you could get the IDL-to-Java converter
to generate this automatically, it has no way of knowing exactly
how the real implementation looks.
<H3><A NAME="ImplementingWrappedCallbacks">
Implementing Wrapped Callbacks</A></H3>
<P>
The notion of the callback is particularly nasty, since you can't
just encapsulate the CORBA calls going to the server. The server
has to make CORBA calls back to the client.
<P>
The stock quote system introduced in <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A> has a good example
of a callback system. Unfortunately, there's one feature in the
stock quote system that needs to be changed. 
<P>
Whenever you create a callback system, leave room for the callback
to throw an exception. You may never use it, but it makes it much
easier to create a distributed version of the application. 
<P>
Figure 19.4 illustrates the relationship between the real implementation
and the CORBA wrappers in a callback system.

<P>
The <TT>StockQuoteClientException</TT>
is a simple subclass of <TT>Exception</TT>
with no extra parameters. The stock-quote server likes to know
when it can no longer send quotes to a client. If an error occurs,
it removes the client from its tables.
<P>
The trick to wrapping CORBA around a callback system is that you
have to create a wrapper for the callback as well as for the server.
The wrapper uses the methods that the non-CORBA server defines
for its callback and then invokes the corresponding method in
the CORBA client.
<P>
Listing 19.5 shows the implementation of the <TT>RemoteStockCallback</TT>
object, which does the distributed callback.

Now in the normal implementation of the stock quote system, the
client calls the <TT>addWatch</TT>
method in the server, passing it the reference to the client and
the name of the stock to watch. The server adds this client to
its tables and invokes the <TT>quote</TT>
method in the client every time the stock's value changes.
<P>
With a CORBA front-end on the server, things change slightly.
When the request comes into the CORBA wrapper, it creates an instance
of <TT>RemoteStockCallback</TT>, passing
to its constructor the client stub that was passed in the <TT>addWatch</TT>
call.
<P>
The wrapper then calls the <TT>addWatch</TT>
method in the real server implementation, passing it the <TT>RemoteStockCallback</TT>.
Here is the implementation of the <TT>addWatch</TT>
method in the CORBA wrapper:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
// addWatch adds a client to the list of clients watching a stock

public void addWatch(StockQuoteClientRef client, String stock)
throws sunw.corba.SystemException, UnknownStock
{

// See if we have already created a callback object for this client.
        RemoteStockCallback callback = (RemoteStockCallback)
                stockClients.get(client);

// If we didn't already have a callback, create one and add it
// to the table.
        if (callback == null) {
                callback = new RemoteStockCallback(client, this);

                stockClients.put(client, callback);
        }

// Now call the addWatch method in the real implementation
        try {
                impl.addWatch(callback, stock);
        } catch (stocks.UnknownStockException e) {
                throw new UnknownStock(stock);
        }

<P>
Now when the real stock quote server publishes a stock quote,
it ends up calling the <TT>quote</TT>
method in the <TT>RemoteStockCallback</TT>
object. This callback object, in turn, calls the <TT>quote</TT>
method in the distributed client. 
<P>
Figure 19.5 illustrates the sequence of events for publishing
a stock quote.
