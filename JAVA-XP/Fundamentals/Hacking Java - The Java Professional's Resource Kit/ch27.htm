<P>
Data encryption is a touchy subject. Many cryptography algorithms
and their implementations are restricted to use within the United
States by the National Security Agency (NSA).
<P>
It is illegal to export certain kinds of encryption software outside
the U.S. There has recently been a push to lift some of these
export restrictions, however, because of the greater need for
security on the Internet. Many American companies can't sell their
software overseas because of the encryption software embedded
in their code.
<P>
The increase in commerce over the Internet has made encryption
a need for some businesses. When you type your credit card number
on an order form, you want to be sure that no one can see the
information as it passes through the Internet. Since you can't
prevent people from snooping on your data, your only hope of safely
keeping your credit card number away from prying eyes is to encrypt
the data before you send it.
<P>
The purpose of encryption is to turn ordinary data into completely
random-looking bits. The notion of &quot;completely random-looking&quot;
is a real science.
<P>
You may think you have some clever little way of encrypting your
data but unless you really know cryptography, your scheme can
probably be broken easily. Unless you really know what you're
doing, stick to the known encryption algorithms and you'll be
pretty safe.
<P>
Data is encrypted with a key that can be a random string of bits,
or some word or phrase that you pick. The key is like a password.
It needs the same degree of secrecy and the same care in creating
a word or phrase that can't be guessed. The key is used by the
encryption algorithm to scramble your data and to unscramble it
on the other side.
<P>
A data encryption algorithm is called a<TT><I>
cipher</I></TT>. The data you are encrypting is called
<TT><I>plaintext</I></TT>, whereas
the encrypted version of the data is called <TT><I>ciphertext</I></TT>.
The process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext is called
<TT><I>decryption</I></TT>.
<P>
Figure 27.1 illustrates a simple use of encryption to pass a coded
message.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-1.html"><B>Figure 27.1 : </B><I>Encryption can be used to pass coded messages</I>.</A>
<P>
Data encryption ciphers are grouped into two categories: block
ciphers and stream ciphers. The stream cipher is a simple single-character-in,
single-character-out cipher. That is, it does the encryption one
character at a time.
<P>
Each time a stream cipher reads a character, it uses the key and
accumulated data from the other characters it has processed to
figure out how to scramble the next byte of data. Unlike some
of the simple ciphers you may be familiar with, a good stream
cipher does not just map one character to another.
<P>
If you feed two A's in a row to a stream cipher, chances are you
will not get two identical characters in a row in the encrypted
text. Figure 27.2 illustrates a stream cipher in action.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-2.html"><B>Figure 27.2 : </B><I>A stream cipher encodes a single character
at a time</I>.</A>
<P>
A block cipher, on the other hand, encrypts whole blocks of data
at a time. Unlike a stream cipher, the block cipher can scramble
all the bits in a block so that the bits for the first byte of
the block can be scrambled and placed in strange places. 
<P>
Of course, the key and the actual values of the bits determine
what the encoded block looks like. The first bit in a block may
end up in one position using a certain key and in a different
position using a different key. Figure 27.3 illustrates a block
cipher in action.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-3.html"><B>Figure 27.3 : </B><I>A block cipher scrambles whole blocks of
data at one time</I>.</A>
<P>
There is another way to classify encryption algorithms, based
on the kind of key used. Some algorithms use a private key, also
called a <TT><I>symmetric key</I></TT>,
whereas others use a public/private key pair, called an <TT><I>asymmetric
pair</I></TT>.
<P>
Private key encryption is probably the one you are most familiar
with. Two parties agree on a secret key. The sender encrypts the
data with the secret key, and the receiver decrypts the data with
the same key. 
<P>
If anyone else finds out the secret key, he or she can spy on
the data being exchanged. Figure 27.4 illustrates a data exchange
using a private key.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-4.html"><B>Figure 27.4 : </B><I>Both parties agree on a private key and
use that key for encryption and decryption</I>.</A>
<P>
One of the problems with private keys is that you have to find
some way of agreeing on the key ahead of time. How do two people
exchange encrypted communications if they have no way to exchange
keys to begin with? Public key encryption provides a neat solution
to this problem.
<P>
With public key encryption, everyone who wants to get encrypted
data creates a private decryption key and a public encryption
key. This is called an<TT><I> asymmetric
key cipher</I></TT> because the encryption key and the
decryption key are different. The important part of this scheme
is that although you can determine the public key based on the
private key, you cannot figure out the private key from the public
key.
<P>
Anyone wanting to send you encrypted data would look up your public
key, which can be published in a number of ways, and use it to
encrypt a message to you. You would receive this message and decrypt
it with your private key. Figure 27.5 illustrates a data exchange
using a public key.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-5.html"><B>Figure 27.5 : </B><I>The data is encrypted with the public key
and decrypted with the private key</I>.</A>
<H2><A NAME="ChoosingtheRightKindofEncryption"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Choosing the Right Kind of Encryption</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Given that a stream cipher handles one byte or even one bit at
a time, you might think that a stream cipher is better for encrypting
computer login sessions, which are more byte-oriented. As it turns
out, block ciphers aren't really too bad for login sessions, since
the blocks are often only 64 bits (8 bytes) in size. Essentially,
your choice of cipher shouldn't depend on whether it is a block
or stream cipher.
<P>
Some of the factors that will influence your choice of encryption
are:
<UL>
<LI><B>The amount of security needed<BR>
</B>Some encryption algorithms can be broken in a matter of hours;
some would take many years. Others would take several times the
anticipated lifetime of the universe to break given machines many
times more powerful than the ones in use today.<BR>
Of course, the price you pay for more security is the encryption
time, among other things. If the data will be useless in an hour,
you don't need an algorithm to protect it for your lifetime.
<LI><B>The speed of the algorithm<BR>
</B>Some algorithms are prohibitively slow for common use. If
you need a Cray mainframe to encrypt and decrypt the data in a
reasonable time, it probably is not a good choice for an applet.
<LI><B>Licensing fees<BR>
</B>The number of patents for encryption algorithms is amazing
compared to the rest of the computing field. Many algorithms,
though publicly available, are still patented and subject to licensing
fees for commercial use.
<LI><B>Availability for Java<BR>
</B>At the outset, Java and encryption algorithms didn't get along
too well. This was because Java is a byte-code-interpreted language,
and encryption algorithms need a lot of computations. As Just-in-Time
(JIT) compilers have emerged, Java has gotten better at meeting
the high demands of these algorithms.
<LI><B>Native versus 100 percent Java implementations<BR>
</B>Several vendors have taken a shortcut to encryption for Java
by using some of the more compute-intensive parts of the algorithms
as native methods. When you start relying on native methods, you
lose the cross-platform advantages of Java.
<LI><B>Export restrictions<BR>
</B>The U.S. has stringent restrictions on the export of encryption
software. If your applet uses a restricted algorithm, you could
be violating U.S. law if your applet is run by someone outside
the U.S. Of course, if you're already outside the U.S., you don't
have this problem. Sometimes an entire algorithm is not restricted,
only the use of keys above a certain size.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="GuardingAgainstMaliciousAttacks"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Guarding Against Malicious Attacks</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Your choice of private keys versus private/public key pairs depends
on what kind of communications you are doing and what are the
possible ways someone might attack your communications.
<P>
Presumably, the reason you are encrypting your data is to hide
something in the data from prying eyes. This hidden information
might be a credit card number, it might be the password to another
system somewhere, or it might just be personal information.
<P>
When you create secure applications, you need to have some idea
of the ways someone can attack your application. In general, the
two kinds of attack are a simple eavesdropping and an impersonation.
<P>
An eavesdropping attack is a passive attack that can be made by
monitoring network traffic. You should assume that anyone who
might want to listen in on a conversation will have access to
such a monitor. Because so many computers can act as network monitors
with only a small amount of programming, this is a safe assumption.
<P>
An impersonation attack is very insidious: Someone has the ability
of impersonating another person or computer. The person sending
confidential information sends the information to the impostor
rather than to the real recipient. This is typically the hardest
attack to defend against and also the hardest attack to use.
<P>
You can see how encryption solves various attacks by starting
first with a conversation that doesn't involve encryption. Then,
as encryption is added to solve various problems, you can see
how the attackers respond. Once you are able to see how devious
an attacker can be, you can design your applications appropriately.
<P>
Figure 27.6 shows a simple conversation between two people with
an eavesdropper watching the conversation.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-6.html"><B>Figure 27.6 : </B><I>Unencrypted conversations are easy prey
for an eavesdropper</I>.</A>
<P>
To solve the simple eavesdropping problem, the participants in
the conversation agree on a secret key and encrypt their conversation.
Now, the eavesdropper doesn't know what they're saying. 
<P>
In certain cases, the eavesdropper may not need to know what they're
saying to make an attack. Suppose, for instance, that the participants
in the conversation are an automatic teller machine and a bank.
<P>
As shown in Figure 27.7, the eavesdropper records the conversation
between the teller machine and the bank as someone at the automatic
teller makes a withdrawal.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-7.html"><B>Figure 27.7 : </B><I>The eavesdropper records an encrypted conversation</I>.</A>
<P>
Some time later, the eavesdropper taps back into the connection
between the bank and the teller machine, and replays the encrypted
conversation. This causes the bank to make another cash withdrawal
from the customer's account and the teller machine to spit out
the cash, as shown in Figure 27.8.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-8.html"><B>Figure 27.8 : </B><I>The eavesdropper can duplicate a transaction
by playing it back at a later time</I>.</A>
<H3><A NAME="ResistingaPlaybackAttack">
Resisting a Playback Attack</A></H3>
<P>
This sort of attack is often useful when encryption is used to
set up a login connection or similar session, but the rest of
the session is unencrypted. An eavesdropper could play back the
login sequence and make a login connection some time after the
original login, without ever knowing the secret key.
<P>
You can counter the playback attack in the case of a login like
this but you should encrypt the entire login session anyway. If
someone wants to infiltrate your system, they could interfere
with your unencrypted session and send bogus commands, intercepting
the responses so you never know they are there.
<P>
A simple trick for thwarting the playback attack is to ensure
that the messages change slightly from one session to the next-not
just that they change, but that they have to change.
<P>
A simple solution for this problem is:
<OL>
<LI>The receiver generates a random number and sends it to the
sender.
<LI>The sender must use the randomly generated number inside the
message it sends to the receiver.
<LI>The receiver ignores any messages with an invalid number.
</OL>
<P>
Now the eavesdropper cannot play back the messages later because
it is highly unlikely that the receiver would generate the same
random number the next time. In the worst case, the eavesdropper
could get the sender to send a message by replaying a previous
number sent by the receiver, but the receiver would ignore the
message because it has the wrong number.
<P>
The eavesdropper could still wreak havoc by replaying previous
messages during the current session. In other words, the eavesdropper
waits for the session to begin and starts recording the conversation.
At some point, the eavesdropper interferes and plays back an earlier
part of the conversation, possibly causing some kind of security
breach.
<P>
If each message has a sequence number associated with it, however,
even that playback attack does not work. Each time a message is
sent, it is given a sequence number that is greater than the previous
sequence number.
<P>
Any out-of-sequence message is ignored. If the eavesdropper plays
back a message from earlier in the session, it has a sequence
number that is out of order and the message is ignored.
<H3><A NAME="DontStoreKeysinYourApplets">
Don't Store Keys in Your Applets</A></H3>
<P>
Java makes simple, symmetric communication almost impossible for
applets. The problem here is that someone could get your applet,
find the secret key, and decrypt a conversation-or impersonate
either or both of the participants. You probably still want to
use symmetric keys for communication, but the sender needs a way
to generate a random session key and send it to the receiver.
<H3><A NAME="UsingPublicKeyEncryptiontoExchangeSessionKeys">
Using Public Key Encryption to Exchange Session Keys</A></H3>
<P>
One of the reasons you don't see public keys used for encrypting
communication channels is that the asymmetric encryption algorithms
tend to take a lot longer than symmetric key encryption. Still,
public keys are quite useful for passing a random session key
to a potential receiver.
<P>
The sequence for this is simple:
<OL>
<LI>The sender generates a random session key and encrypts it
with the receiver's public key.
<LI>The receiver decrypts the session key using the private key
and the two are ready to talk.
</OL>
<P>
Unfortunately, you can't just store the public key in your applet,
either. If you do, you open yourself up to an impersonation, or
&quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; attack. Java is particularly vulnerable
to this kind of attack because the code itself is downloaded over
the network. 
<P>
An impersonator impersonates the receiver to the sender and the
sender to the receiver, as shown in Figure 27.9.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-9.html"><B>Figure 27.9 : </B><I>An impersonator sits between two communicating
parties and impersonates them both</I>.</A>
<P>
Normally, this kind of attack doesn't work with public key encryption
unless you can somehow make the sender think the public key is
something other than it is. In Java, this turns out to be a simpler
task, although digital signatures throw an extra wrench into the
works.
<P>
If an impersonator wants to set up shop, it first impersonates
the receiver. When the server downloads an applet from the receiver,
it really downloads the applet from the impersonator. As shown
in Figure 27.10, the impersonator has cleverly substituted its
own public key in place of the receiver's public key in the applet.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-10.html"><B>Figure 27.10: </B><I>The impersonator gives a phony applet
to the sender</I>.</A>
<P>
When the sender generates a random session key, it encrypts it
with what is now the impersonator's public key and sends the encrypted
session key to the impersonator. The impersonator, wanting to
spy but not be found out, impersonates the sender by generating
a random session key, encrypting it with the receiver's public
key, and sending it to the receiver. 
<P>
As shown in Figure 27.11, the sender now thinks it is talking
to the receiver, while the receiver thinks it is talking to the
sender. The impersonator, however, is in the middle, watching
all the data go by.
<P>
<A HREF="f27-11.html"><B>Figure 27.11: </B><I>The impersonator is now playing the part
of the sender and the receiver</I>.</A>
<P>
Anytime the sender sends information to the receiver, the impersonator
intercepts it and then passes it on to the real receiver-but not
before saving any interesting parts for later use.
<P>
As discussed in <A HREF="ch26.htm" >Chapter 26</A>, &quot;Securing Applets with Digital
Signatures,&quot; digital signatures can put a damper on this
kind of activity but they cannot prevent all attacks. In particular,
if the impersonator is able to sign the phony applet with some
other valid signature, the sender thinks the applet is okay.
<H3><A NAME="UsingSecureHTTPtoThwartImpersonations">
Using Secure HTTP to Thwart Impersonations</A></H3>
<P>
The problem with thwarting an impersonation attack is that it
needs some piece of secret data on the sender side that the impersonator
cannot change. If the server is running an applet that is downloaded
from another site, every part of the applet is subject to impersonation.
<P>
Secure HTTP pages are not subject to impersonation because the
browser uses a certification authority to verify the Web page,
much the same way that the digital signature mechanism verifies
an applet. The nice thing is that not only is the Web page downloaded
securely, everything on the page is downloaded with the same secure
mechanism, including applets. 
<P>
Thus, you can assure your customers that if they connect to your
Web page using Secure HTTP, you can guarantee the safety of any
information they give to your applets. That is, assuming you are
wise enough to encrypt the data before you send it to your server!

Phaos Technologies (<TT><B><A HREF="http://www.phaos.com/">http://www.phaos.com</A></B></TT>)
has created an implementation of the secure sockets layer (SSL)
protocol. SSL is like the regular network socket implementation
you are familiar with but it adds a nice degree of security. 
<P>
When a client makes an SSL connection with a server, the server
provides the client with a digitally signed certificate verifying
that it is the intended server. Through a series of checks, the
client can determine whether it is the real server or an impostor.
<P>
The specification for SSL is publicly available from Netscape
Communications.The SSL Version 2 document is located at <TT><B><A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/SSL.html">http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/SSL.html</A></B></TT>.
The proposal for the new SSL Version 3 standard is at <TT><B><A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/index.html">http://home.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/index.html</A></B></TT>.
<P>
The SSLava library is available for free for noncommercial use,
but commercial users must buy a license. SSLava is written entirely
in Java, allowing you to use it on any Java-enabled platform.
Unfortunately, according to the non-commercial license for SSLava,
you cannot redistribute the binary copy of their libraries along
with your applet. In other words, if you want someone to run your
SSLava applet, they must download SSLava themselves. You do not
have these restrictions if you purchase a commercial license.

Getting the Cryptix Library</A></H3>
<P>
Systemics, Ltd. (<TT><B><A HREF="http://www.systemics.com/">http://www.systemics.com</A></B></TT>)
has created an excellent library of encryption classes for Java.
Unlike SSLava, some of the Systemics code is used as a native
library, making it hard to write applets that use the code.
<P>
It does, however, provide a variety of encryption algorithms and
is available free for commercial and noncommercial use. Since
Systemics is not in the U.S., their software is not subject to
the U.S. export restrictions. Still, there may be some patent
problems since some of the algorithms used in the library are
patented in the U.S.
<P>
Systemics recommends that you seek professional legal advice about
whether or not you can legally use their software in your country.
<P>
Cryptix is handy when you need to do large amounts of encryption.
Since it is implemented as a native library, it is very fast.
While Cryptix may not be as desirable for applets, it works very
well for stand-alone applications.
<P>
All of the block ciphers in the Cryptix library are subclasses
of the <TT>BlockCipher</TT> class,
which has methods to encrypt and decrypt blocks of data. One of
the things that appears to be lacking from the library is a way
to automatically encrypt or decrypt a multi-block buffer.
<P>
This is, in part, because it is hard to handle partial blocks.
When the data doesn't fill a complete block, you usually pad the
block with zeroes. Unfortunately, you have to figure out where
the padding starts when you decrypt the data, which requires that
you embed the information in the encryption. If you are willing
to accept the padding at the end of an encrypted buffer, it is
simple just to break up a buffer into multiple blocks and encrypt
each block.

Listing 27.1 shows an input stream filter that decrypts data using
the Cryptix library. When you create the stream, you pass it the
cipher you want to use.

All the <TT>BlockCipherInputStream</TT>
does is read whole blocks of encrypted data, decrypt them, and
then dole the unencrypted data out one byte at a time through
the <TT>read</TT> method. This class
is quite handy because you can now use encryption on any data
stream, including a network socket. 
<P>
The companion to this class is the <TT>BlockCipherOutputStream</TT>,
which takes one byte at a time, stores the byte in a block, and
encrypts each block as it fills up. It then writes out the block
onto the output stream it is filtering.
<P>
Listing 27.2 shows the <TT>BlockCipherOutputStream</TT>.

These classes are fairly small. All they really do is arrange
data into a form more suitable for the encryption and decryption
routines, which do the hard work.
<P>
Listing 27.3 shows a program that tests out both the encryption
and decryption streams using a pipe. It uses the IDEA cipher for
encryption, which is a patented cipher and must be licensed for
commercial use. It can be used noncommercially for free.<BR>

The technique used in the IdeaCrypt program of testing input and output stream filters by using a pipe is a handy technique. You can also use it to test out networking protocols if you are writing both sides of the protocol. The pipe takes only two lines 
of code to create, compared to the amount of time it takes to set up socket connections.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Getting the Acme Crypto Package</A></H3>
<P>
Jef Poskanzer has written a number of useful Java classes, including
an encryption package. You can find his excellent Java software
at <TT><B><A HREF="http://www.acme.com/java">http://www.acme.com/java</A></B></TT>.
The beauty of the Acme package is that it is written entirely
in Java. This means that your applets can use encryption and not
need the installation of native libraries on the local host.
<P>
The Acme Crypto package makes a good complement to the SSLava
package. You can use SSLava for a normal encrypted data exchange,
and then use Crypto for various areas where the SSL protocol doesn't
make sense or is too cumbersome. For instance, you might use the
Crypto package to create encrypted data files. The Crypto package
is also advantageous if you don't want to buy a commercial license
for SSLava but don't want to require that your users download
the encryption library themselves.<BR>

The unfortunate aspect of downloadable encryption code is that you may violate the U.S. export restrictions if your site is based in the U.S. and the encryption method you use is restricted. If you are in the U.S. and plan to make your applet available 
internationally, you should seek professional legal advice about the steps you need to take.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The Crypto package includes several block ciphers, such as DES,
DES3, and IDEA. The data encryption standard (DES) algorithm has
been around for a number of years and is used heavily around the
U.S.
<P>
Because of the relatively small key length of DES, information
is sometimes encrypted three times with DES, using two different
keys. This is called <TT><I>DES3</I></TT>.
<P>
The IDEA cipher is a relatively new block encryption scheme that
is still undergoing some analysis of its security. The IDEA cipher
is patented, and you have to get a license if you want to use
it commercially.
<P>
The owners of the patent, Ascom Systec AG, are based in Switzerland
and can be reached over the Net at <TT><B><A HREF="mailto:idea@ascom.ch">idea@ascom.ch</A></B></TT>.
<P>
In addition to block ciphers, the Crypto package has two stream
ciphers. One cipher, the rot13, is a simple substitution cipher
that is completely insecure. Rot13 is an alphabetic shift in which
A is replaced with M, B is replaced with N, and so on.
<P>
It is popular on the UseNet for hiding &quot;spoilers&quot; to
games and movies, or for hiding potentially offensive material.
Most newsreaders can decrypt rot13 so you can view the hidden
information if you choose to. Don't even think of using rot13
as a security tool. It is mainly used for testing.
<P>
The RC4 stream cipher is a secure cipher that is both restricted
for export and patented. The patent is owned by RSA Data Security
Inc., who originally kept the design of RC4 a secret.
<P>
Unfortunately for RSA, someone anonymously posted the algorithm
to the UseNet in 1994, exposing it to the world. RSA still owns
the patent on the algorithm, however, so if you plan to use it
in a commercial product, you should contact RSA for licensing
information.
<P>
The Crypto package also includes <TT>EncryptedInputStream</TT>
and <TT>EncryptedOutputStream</TT>
filters. You can filter any input or output stream with these
filters, using any stream or block cipher in the Crypto package.
You can also create new ciphers by subclassing the <TT>BlockCipher</TT>
and <TT>StreamCipher</TT> classes.
<P>
The Crypto package is used in a remote system-access application
in <A HREF="ch28.htm" >Chapter 28</A>, &quot;Accessing Remote Systems Securely.&quot;
