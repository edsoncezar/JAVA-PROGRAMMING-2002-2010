The key ingredients that make an object well-designed, therefore, are things that client
programmers would care about. The two main qualities I look for in an object are 1)
it does its job well, and 2) it is easy to use. These are, in fact, the same two
qualities I look for in just about any machine I bring into my everyday life.
If I buy a new cyclometer for my bicycle, for example, I want that cyclometer to
work well -- to reliably keep accurate time, distance, and speed records. But I also
want it to be easy to use. I want services that I request often from my cyclometer,
such as switching the display between distance, time of day, speed, and average
speed, to be quick and easy to get at. I don't mind terribly if services that I request
less often, such as setting my tire size or the current time, are more difficult to
get at. But in no case do I want to invest more than a few minutes of my time pressing
buttons and, if necessary, consulting the instruction booklet to access any functionality
offered by my cyclometer.

<P>
Similarly, if I buy an implementation of an API and instantiate one of its classes, I want the resulting
object to work well. I want the object to do what it
promises to do, in an efficient manner, every time I ask it. But I also want the object to be easy to use.
I want the object's interface to be designed such that I can, with no more than a few minutes of looking
through the APIs documentation, figure out how to ask
the object to do whatever I want it to do.

<H2>Semantics</H2>
<UL>
<LI>
Guideline: <EM>Appreciate the significance of semantics.</EM>
<LI>
interface = syntax + semantics
<LI>
semantics = semantic contract + meta-semantics
<LI>
Semantic contract: what the object can do for me (how it will behave) and how I use it
<LI>
Meta-semantics: what I can do with the object
<LI>
An organ keyboard has:
<UL>
<LI>interface syntax: the positions of the keys
<LI>interface semantics: the frequency of the tones generated when you push the keys
<LI>implementation: pipes, electronic guts, etc...
</UL>
<LI>
THIS IS THE SIGNIFICANCE: Common understanding of semantics between designer and
client is crucial to getting things working together in the first place
and fulfillment of the "can change the implementation
without breaking code" promise.
</UL>

Another way that dividing up systems into objects, each of which has defined responsibilities, helps programmers
manage complexity is that
it means our software is organized like our social structures are organized. People have areas of responsibility.
To get things done in society, people provide services to each other. They fulfill their contracts to each
other. Objects in object-oriented programs act similiarly, and this makes complex software easier for human
programmers to grasp.

<P>
Object-oriented programs are divided into various areas of responsibility. The initial process of
design involves "discovering objects." Figuring out what the objects should be, what their names are,
and what responsibilities each object has. Fleshing out the design involves devising methods, with both signatures
and semantic contracts, through which the object will provide the services, fulfill its responsibilities, to clients.
Objects do not eliminate complexity. They just help programers manage complexity.

<P>
<CODE>Comparable</CODE> also means: I can sort an array or collection
with <CODE>Arrays.sort()</CODE> or <CODE>Collections.sort()</CODE> (meta-semantics)

<P>
meta-semantics of Serializable is that if there's a readObject method with a certain signature in a
Serializable object's class, then the semantics of that method are... So, if I have a <CODE>readObject</CODE> that
means something different, then I can't make that class Serializable because it breaks the (meta-) semantics
of Serializable.

<P>
Giving objects responsibilities helps people understand software, becuase that's how we get work
done among people, so programmers are familiar with this way of doing things. It's how we
organize our socities. The big difference is that when someone doesn't do their job right,
or there's a misunderstanding of (or different perspectives on) the requirements, then people
can talk it out or, if that doesn't work, go to court. Software just doesn't work.
