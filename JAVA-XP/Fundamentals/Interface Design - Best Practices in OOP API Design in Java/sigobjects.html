<P>
Objects are for people, not for computers.
The point of objects is not to help computers run software, but to help people
develop software.
Computers are just as happy running assembly language programs as object-oriented programs.
But people are happier writing object-oriented programs.
OK, if not always happier, then hopefully at least more productive.
The main aim of advances in software technology, from machine
language to assembly to
procedural languages to object-oriented languages, has been to help programmers do their jobs. In particular,
objects help programmers manage
complexity and change in their software.

<!--
An object's
interface is like the television's buttons and knobs, its how someone on the outside, the <EM>client</EM>, uses
the object.
-->

<H1>Managing Complexity</H1>
<P>
Moore's law says that computer hardware doubles in capability and halves in price every 18 months.
For programmers, this is good news and bad news. The good news is that programmers get ever more
blazing machines to work with. The bad news is that
as hardware becomes cheaper and more powerful, software becomes larger and more complex.
One of the main ways objects assist programmers is in helping them manage the increasing complexity of
software.

<P>
A well-designed object is understandable.
Large software systems are difficult to understand. If a system
is composed of individual object pieces, however, each object can embody an amount of complexity
that can be fully grasped. Programmers can then understand the behavior of the system as a whole
in terms of the behavior of its object pieces and the interactions between them.

<P>
Every object you design, therefore, should encapsulate an amount of complexity that can be readily
grasped by human programmers.
During an object-oriented design, you divide the requirements of a system into
areas of responsibility. You assign each area of responsibility to a class of object, and give each class a name.
For each named class, you devise a bundle of services (each service offered by a method)
through which the instances of that class fulfill their responsibilities. By giving each object a focused
area of responsibility that encompasses a reasonable level of complexity, you help
programmers who use your objects deal with the overall complexity of their systems.

<P>
Understanding is further helped by the tendency for many classes to be named after relevant
objects or concepts from the problem domain,
such as <CODE>Account</CODE>, <CODE>Matrix</CODE>, or <CODE>StampDispenser</CODE>.
To the extent that classes model familiar real-world objects and concepts from the problem
domain, programmers may find it easier to understand and use instances of those classes.
Moreover, programmers may also find it easier to comprehend object-oriented systems because
the organization of object-oriented systems is somewhat similar to the organization of human
endeavors. If you have some goal, you can hire people to help you achieve that goal. Each
person agrees to play some role, perform some job, and you organize and direct their
individual efforts to help you achieve your overall goal. Similarly, to accomplish some goal in
a system, you enlist the help of objects, each of which is expected
to fulfill the obligations delineated in their contract. By organizing and directing the
services provided by the objects, you can achieve your overall goal for the system.

<P>
In addition to being understandable, an object is also discussable.
Every class of object has a name. To the programmers working on a system, an object's class
name comes to mean the object's area of responsibility and the set of services through which
the object fulfills its responsibility.
As the members of a development team discover, name, and define objects during an object-oriented
design, a vocabulary develops.
This vocabulary, made up of class names and their meanings, facilitates communication among
the programmers working on the system. The more effectively programmers are able to communicate
about their system, the more effective they will be at taming its complexity.

<P>
Lastly, objects are debuggable.  When you organize your system with objects, you tend to encapsulate code that manipulates
particular data inside the object that contains the data. This keeps code
that operates on particular data from being replicated and spread throughout the system. If a bug is detected
that causes certain data to become corrupt, programmers need only look in one place to find the bug: the code that defines
the object's methods. Once that bug is fixed in the object's code, you know it is fixed everywhere, because
the object's code is the only code that can manipulate the data.
This process of encapsulating code with data in objects, combined with a strong separation of interface
and implementation, helps programmers build objects that are thoroughly debugged and, therefore,
reliable and robust.
I have found in my own development experiences that achieving a robust system requires constructing
the system out of robust parts.
Therefore, objects help programmers build systems that, despite their overall complexity, are robust because
their systems are constructed out of robust object parts.

<H1>Managing Change</H1>

<P>
Besides complexity, the other fundamental reality of software development that programmers must
wrestle with is change.
If a software project doesn't fail initially, the resulting codebase tends to have a long life. With each
new release comes new requirements. Existing code is tweaked and enhanced to fix bugs and add functionality.
Objects, in addition to helping programmers manage complexity, help programmers manage change.

<P>
One of the main ideals in the object-oriented approach to programming is a strong separation of
object interface from object implementation.
The primary enemy of change in a software system is coupling, the interdependencies between the
various parts of a system.
The aim of keeping interface and implementation separate is to help programmers minimize coupling in their systems.
At a keynote address I saw Bill Joy give in Washington, D.C., Joy described coupling
by saying, "You slap your hand on this table in Washington and a building falls down in San Francisco."
In other words, you make a small, seemingly innocuous change in one part of your system, and you
inadvertently cause a disaster in a remote and unrelated part of your system.
In an object-oriented system, object interfaces are the point of coupling between the different parts
of a system.
Because object interfaces are the only point of coupling between the parts, many kinds of
changes can be made to object
implementations without breaking the expectations of client code.
When you slap the implementation of a <CODE>Table</CODE> object in Washington,
all the buildings in San Francisco continue to stand tall.

<!--
<P>
Maybe have a diagram. An object's Name implies Services (interface syntax + semantics)
-->

<P>
Another way objects help programmers deal with change is that, because of polymorphism and
dynamic binding, programmers can treat objects as replaceable modules.

<!-- THIS IS GOING INTO THE TUTORIAL
Two fundamental
concepts of object-oriented programming are polymorphism and dynamic binding. Polymorphism means that you
can hold a reference to a subclass object in a variable of superclass type. Dynamic binding means that
at runtime, the method that is appropriate to an object's actual class is invoked, regardless of the
type of the reference.
-->

Polymorphism
and dynamic binding enable you to unplug one implementation of an object interface and plug in a different
implementation of that interface. This makes it easy to change a system by defining a new subclass of
some superclass, instantiating the subclass, and passing the resulting object
to existing code that knows only of the superclass.

<P>
Lastly, objects help programmers manage change because object contracts can be very abstract.
An object's contract, the human language description of what the object promises to do for
you when you invoke its instance methods, is usually couched in terms of behavior.
Instance data is kept private and, as a result, the structure of the instance data does not
form part of the object's contract. Contracts expressed in terms of behavior can be more abstract
than contracts expressed in terms of data, simply because you can be more vague when you describe
behavior than when you describe data.
The more abstract a contract is, the more ways you have to fulfill the obligations outlined in that
contract. The high level of abstraction at which object contracts can be expressed gives more
options to programmers who need to change an implementation, or plug in a new implementation, of an interface.
The higher the level of abstraction in the contract, the more freedom programmers have
in making implementation changes
that are compatible with the expectations of client code.

<!--
<P>
A testable unit: Encapsulates behavior. Can test, so when you make a change, can be sure you haven't
broken the contract.
-->


<P>
The significance of the object, therefore, is that they are for people, not for computers.
 The reason
objects exist is to help human programmers do their jobs. This is important to keep in mind when designing
APIs, because if objects are for people, then object interfaces are for people too. (After all, API means
Application <EM>Programmer</em> Interface) When you design
an API, you are designing for the benefit of human programmers.
