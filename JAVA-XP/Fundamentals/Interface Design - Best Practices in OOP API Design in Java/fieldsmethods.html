<P>
The Guidelines:
<UL>
<LI>Guideline: <STRONG>Make the types of your method parameters and
return values as precise as possible.</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>The higher up the inheritance hierarchy a type is, the more abstract its contract is.
Contracts become more concrete as you go down the hierarchy. Code coupled to types higher
up the inheritance hierarchy is more flexible, because the contract is more abstract. The
contract can be fulfilled in more ways. So you should make the type as high up as
possible, but no higher. If you make it higher than is really required, then clients
will have to downcast in their code.</EM>

<P>
<LI>Guideline: <STRONG>Avoid data overloading.</STRONG>
<LI>Guideline: <STRONG>Prefer constants over hard-coded literals.</STRONG>
<LI>Guideline: <STRONG>Minimize method coupling.</STRONG>
<LI>Guideline: <STRONG>Maximize method cohesion.</STRONG>
</UL>

<STRONG>Avoid data overloading.</STRONG>
</A>

<P>
Don't assign a special meaning to <A href="fields.html">special values</A> of a field in an effort to represent multiple attributes with the single field.
     Instead, use a separate field to represent each separate attribute of a class or object.


<HR width="100%">
<A name="constants">
<STRONG>Prefer constants over hard-coded literals.</STRONG>
</A>

<P>
Prefer constants (static final fields) over hard-coded literals (1.5, "Hi there!"), especially if you need to use the same
     constant value in multiple places.
(mention special compile-time resolution of constants.)
(Also, somewhere should mention can use access methods even for constants,
so they can be overridden and changed without recompiling everything that
uses them.)

<HR width="100%">
<A name="mincoupling">
<STRONG>Minimize method coupling.</STRONG>
</A>

<P>
(Always strive to minimize the coupling</A> of methods: Take as input only data needed by the method; express as output only
     data produced by the method.)

<HR width="100%">
<A name="maxcohesion">
<STRONG>Maximize method cohesion.</STRONG>
</A>

<P>
Make methods do just one thing.
(Always strive to maximize the cohesion of methods: Focus each method on one conceptual task, and give it a name that clearly
indicates the nature of that task.
Avoid passing data used for control (for deciding how to perform the method's job) down into methods.)
Balance maximizing method cohesion (which can increase the number of methods in a class) with keeping the number of methods
in a class to a manageable level.
-->

<P>
Be suspicious of interpreters. One way to express intent is in a well-formed string of a language. I built
a lot of these at one point in my career. You define a language, and the semantics, the meaning of various
strings in that language. You then build an interpreter for that language, that sucks in well-formed
strings (i.e., programs) and then does something. For example, a Java compiler gives error messages and
generates class files. In a Java program, you can actually have objects passing strings to each other
that indicate semantics of what the client is asking the object to do.

<P>
The thing is that this is object-oriented API design is designing with types, in which you attach
semantics to types, whose contracts are expressed in terms of behavior. Designing a context free
langauge, or a regular language, an XML schema or XML DTD, or a network protocol, etc, is data
model design, in which you define what the data can look like and what the meaning of it is.

<P>
One thing you can do with interpreter is make your system "customizable" by defining a scripting
language. But another way to do that, which you may wish to consider, is to define a type and
use dynamic extension. Allow clients to define and indicate the names of new classes that implement
some interface or extend some class you define in your API. Your system can dynamically load and
use this customized type.
