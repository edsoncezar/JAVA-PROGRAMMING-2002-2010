<P>
The Web is a powerful interface to everything the Internet has
to offer. A few years ago, when people thought of the Internet,
they equated it with the monotony of low-level protocols like
FTP and Telnet. Today, when most people think of the Internet,
they think of the dynamic environment that enables them to search
through and access complex &quot;webs&quot; of text, graphics,
sound, and video. In short, they equate the Web with the Internet-and
that's because the Web has swallowed the Net.
<H2><A NAME="NavigatingtheWorldWideWeb"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Navigating
the World Wide Web</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Navigating the Web can be as easy as activating a hypertext link.
The power of hypertext is in its simplicity and transparency.
Users can navigate through a global network of resources at the
touch of a button. Hypertext documents are linked together through
keywords or specified <I>hot areas</I> within the document. These
hot areas could be graphical icons or even parts of indexed maps.
<P>
When a new word or idea is introduced, hypertext makes it possible
to jump to another document containing complete information on
the new topic. Readers see links as highlighted keywords or images
displayed graphically. They can access additional documents or
resources by selecting the highlighted keywords or images.
<P>
To look through hypertext documents, you need a browser. A <I>browser</I>
is a software application that enables you to access the World
Wide Web. When a hypertext document is loaded in your browser,
you can activate a link by moving your mouse pointer to the area
of the link and clicking the left mouse button.
<P>
Generally, text containing a hypertext link is underlined and
displayed in a different color than other text on the page. By
default, most browsers display links that you have not visited
in blue and links that you have visited in purple or light red.
<P>
As you point-and-click your way through the Web, you probably
do not think about the URLs you are using to access Web resources.
However, if you plan to display Java applets on the Web, you should
stop and think about the URLs you use. When you move your mouse
pointer over a link, most browsers display the URL path to the
file or object that will be retrieved when you activate the link.
This is useful for identifying the type of file referenced by
the link.
<P>
Most Web documents written in the <I>Hypertext Markup Language</I>
(HTML) have the <TT>htm</TT> or <TT>.html</TT>
extension. For example, the URL path <TT>http://www.tvp.com/idn/idnframe.html</TT>
tells the browser to use the <I>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</I>
(HTTP) to obtain a file called <TT>idnframe.html</TT>
in the <TT>idn</TT> directory on the
<TT>www.tvp.com</TT> Web server.
<P>
Although following text-based links on Web pages is easy, following
links embedded in graphic objects sometimes isn't. Some clickable
images are displayed on the page with a distinctive blue border-this
type is easy to identify. Other clickable images, however, have
no borders around them at all, primarily because that Web publisher
chose to use the extensions to HTML that enable the suppression
of the border around images. So, how do you know when an image
is clickable and when it is not if it has no distinct border?
<P>
One way to tell if the image is clickable is to move your mouse
pointer over the image. If your browser shows that a URL (pronounced
&quot;you-are-el&quot;) path is associated with the image, you
can click on it. Most images used on the Web are in either GIF
or JPEG format. GIF images usually have a <TT>.gif</TT>
extension. JPEG images usually have a <TT>.jpg</TT>
or <TT>.jpeg</TT> extension. For example,
the URL 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>http://www.tvpress.com/idn/idnttl.gif
</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
tells the browser to use the hypertext transfer protocol to obtain
a GIF image called <TT>idnttl.gif</TT>
in the <TT>idn</TT> directory on the
<TT>www.tvpress.com</TT> Web server.
<P>
URLs are much more powerful and complex than these simple examples
suggest. The next section takes a closer look at the structure
of URLs and how they are used on the Web.
<H2><A NAME="UsingURLs"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Using URLs</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
<I>Uniform resource locators</I> (URLs) provide a uniform way
of identifying resources that are available using Internet protocols.
To better understand URLs, you should learn how they are defined
and the formats for them.
<H3><A NAME="HowURLsAreDefined">How URLs Are Defined</A></H3>
<P>
URLs consist of characters defined by the ASCII character set.
The URL specification allows for the use of uppercase and lowercase
letters, but uppercase letters are generally not used. Not using
uppercase letters avoids confusion when moving documents from
a system that is case sensitive to one that isn't and vice versa.
<P>
Although URLs consist of characters defined by the ASCII character
set, you cannot use all ASCII characters in your URLs. You can
use the letters a-z, the numerals 0-9, and a few special characters.
The special characters include asterisks, commas, dollar signs,
exclamation points, hyphens, parentheses, periods, plus signs,
single quotation marks, and underscores. You are limited to these
special characters because other characters used in URLs have
specific meanings. For example, the tilde character is used to
map URLs to HTML directories in a user's home directory.

A detailed look at URL formats, syntax, and reserved characters is beyond the scope of this book. For an authoritative plain-English look at URLs, I recommend <I>Web Publishing Unleashed</I> from Sams.net. <A HREF="ch3.htm" tppabs="http://www.mcp.com/835574400/1-57521/1-57521-088-6/ch3.htm" >Chapter 3</A>, 
&quot;Publishers' Tour of the Web,&quot; covers everything Web publishers should know about URLs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="URLFormats">URL Formats</A></H3>
<P>
The basic mechanism that makes URLs so versatile is their standard
naming scheme. URL schemes name the protocol the client will use
to access and transfer a particular file. Web clients use the
name of the protocol to determine the format for the information
that follows the protocol name. The protocol name is generally
followed by a colon and two forward slashes (<TT>//</TT>).
The colon is a separator. The double forward slash marks indicate
that the protocol uses the format defined by the Common Internet
Scheme Syntax.
<P>
The <I>Common Internet Scheme Syntax</I> is a common syntax for
URL schemes that involve the direct use of Internet Protocol-based
protocols. <I>IP-based protocols</I> specify a particular host
on the Internet by a unique numeric identifier called an <I>IP
address</I> or by a unique name that can be resolved to the IP
address. The information following the double slash marks follows
a format that is dependent on the protocol type referenced in
the URL. Here are two general formats:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>protocol://hostname:port/path_to_resource
<BR>
<BR>
protocol://username:password@hostname:port/path_to_resource</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Hostname information used in URLs identifies the address to a
host and is broken down into two or more parts separated by periods.
The periods are used to separate domain information from the hostname.
Common domain names for Web servers begin with <TT>www</TT>
(for example, <TT>www.tvp.com</TT>
identifies the Web server called <TT>tvp</TT>
in the <TT>commercial</TT> domain).
<P>
<I>Ports</I> are rather like telephone jacks on the Web server.
The server has certain ports allocated for certain things, such
as port 80 for your incoming requests for hypertext documents.
The server listens on a particular port. When it hears something,
it-in essence-picks up the phone and connects the particular port.
<P>
Port information used in URLs identifies the port number to be
used for the connection. If you do not specify a port number,
a default value is used by your browser as necessary. Therefore,
you do not have to specify port numbers in your URLs unless the
connection will be made to a port other than the default.
<P>
By specifying the username and password information in a URL,
you allow users to log into a system automatically. The two protocols
that use both username and password information are FTP and Telnet.
In an FTP session, the username and password information is often
used to allow users to log into FTP servers anonymously. When
a connection is made to an FTP server and the username and password
information is not specified, the following default values are
assumed: <TT>anonymous</TT> or <TT>guest
</TT>for the username and the user's e-mail address as
the password.
<P>
In Telnet, there are no default values. If you do not supply the
username and password, the user will be prompted for this information,
which is good because you don't want everyone to be able to remotely
log into your server. You could allow users to log in automatically
by specifying a user and password in your URL. However, you generally
do not want to specify a personal password in a URL. Therefore,
if you want users to be able to log in automatically using Telnet,
you should create a guest account with a generic password. In
this way, you can strictly control the access guests have on your
system.
<P>
The final part of a URL is the path to the resource. This path
generally follows the directory structure from the root or slash
directory to the resource specified in the URL.
<H2><A NAME="WebSurfingwithJavaEnhancedBrowsers"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#Ff0000>Web
Surfing with Java-Enhanced Browsers</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Browsers are available for use on almost any computer operating
system, including Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, Windows 3.1, Windows
95/NT, and UNIX. You can think of a browser as your window to
the Web; if you change your browser, you get a whole new view
of what's out there. Use Lynx, and your window to the Web has
only text. Text-only browsers are the original browsers for the
Web. Although it might be hard to believe, several text-only browsers
are still being developed.
<P>
Use ncSA Mosaic, and your window to the Web has text and graphics.
Browsers that allow you to view Web documents containing text
and graphics are the second generation of browsers, which are
largely responsible for the phenomenal success of the Web.
<P>
Use HotJava, and your window has text, graphics, and live animation.
Browsers that allow you to view Web documents containing text,
graphics, inline multimedia, and live applications are the third
generation of browsers that are driving the Web's transition to
an extremely visual medium that rivals television for information
content and entertainment value.
<H3><A NAME="HotJava">HotJava</A></H3>
<P>
The HotJava browser, developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., is written
entirely in Java. As the first browser to support Java applets,
HotJava is extremely popular. Although the Alpha version of HotJava
supports only Java Alpha, more recent versions of the browser
support the 1.0 API. Versions of the browser are available for
Macintosh, Windows 95/NT, and Sun Solaris.
<P>
Although HotJava is popular, it is not feature rich like some
of the other Java-enhanced browsers; it has a rather plain interface
and limited extras. Still, HotJava is currently in the testing
stages and may yet evolve into a full-featured browser.

<H3><A NAME="NetscapeNavigator">Netscape Navigator</A></H3>
<P>
The Netscape Navigator is the most widely used Web browser; versions
of it are available for Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX X Window
systems. Driven by Netscape's rise as a commercial corporation
worth hundreds of millions of dollars, all of Netscape's products
are shifting to a commercial model. However, you can download
free versions of Netscape Navigator at the Netscape Web site.
Netscape's Web site is shown in Figure 3.2. The URL to this site

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Not only does Navigator support Java, but it is undoubtedly the
most feature-rich browser available today. It supports HTML 3.0,
plug-ins, JavaScript, and unique Netscape extensions to HTML,
such as frames. With HTML 3.0, you get support for tables, figures,
and all the advanced features of HTML. Plug-ins allow you to add
modules for inline video, sound, and multimedia. JavaScript, a
scripting language modeled after Java, enables you to do client-side
scripting.
<P>
Before you download the Navigator, keep in mind that only versions
2.0 and later support Java. Furthermore, although Netscape Navigator
is available for a wide variety of platforms, Java support is
limited to those platforms to which the JDK has been ported.
<H3><A NAME="OraclePowerBrowser">Oracle PowerBrowser</A></H3>
<P>
PowerBrowser is everything you would expect in a browser created
by the database giant Oracle. The PowerBrowser software package
includes a local database called Blaze, which enables you store
and manage large amounts of data efficiently. The browser also
supports HTML 3.0 and extensions to the HTML standard including
backgrounds, tables, embedded objects, and Java. Developers <BR>
versions of Oracle PowerBrowser for Windows 95 are available free
of charge for evaluation.

<H3><A NAME="InternetExplorer">Internet Explorer</A></H3>
<P>
One of the most powerful browsers currently available is the Internet
Explorer from Microsoft. This full-featured browser took the Web
by storm in 1995 and quickly moved to the number-two position
in popularity. Versions of Internet Explorer are available for
Macintosh, Windows 95, and Windows NT.
<P>
Internet Explorer supports HTML 3; all Netscape extensions; and
powerful multimedia extensions including background sounds, scrolling
marquees, and inline video movies. Versions 3.0 and later also
feature support for Java, ActiveX controls, and VBScript. With
the release of the Internet Explorer VR extension that enables
full VRML capability, Internet Explorer is definitely the browser
to watch. Microsoft is also developing an enhanced version of
VRML called ActiveVRML, with which you can create animated VRML
worlds that take advantage of Java.
<P>

Although the <I>Java Applet Reviewing Service</I> (JARS) is a
relative newcomer to the Web, it is my favorite for finding recent
innovations in Java applet programming. Figure 3.9 shows the JARS
Web site. As the name implies, JARS provides ratings for Java
applets that are available on the Web. The top applets rated in
any given time period are given awards in the following categories:

Java Tools</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Lots of third-party development tools are available for Java.
This section focuses on the best of these tools. The speed with
which industry giants, like Borland and Symantec, introduced Java
development tools speaks volumes about Java's popularity and potential.
<H3><A NAME="BorlandCforJavaDevelopers">Borland C++ for Java Developers</A>
</H3>
<P>
Borland C++ for Java developers is a cutting-edge development
environment for C/C++ and Java. To ease the transition for current
C/C++ and Java programmers, Borland integrated its award-winning
C++ development environment with Sun's Java Developer's Kit. The
result is a graphical development environment that allows you
to develop, test, and debug your applications without ever having
to use command-line tools.

Symantec Caf&eacute; is an integrated development environment
for Java developers who use Windows 95/NT or the Power Mac. Like
Borland C++, Symantec Caf&eacute; uses the tools in Sun's Java
Developer's Kit as the basis for its graphical development environment.
In fact, Caf&eacute; includes the entire release version of the
JDK, which provides the Java class library source code and samples.
<P>
The integrated environment within which the program operates is
called the Caf&eacute; Desktop. The desktop is a customizable
interface to all the tools in Symantec Caf&eacute;. Because Caf&eacute;
Desktop supports virtual desktop environments, you can access
multiple viewing areas at the press of a button. You can learn
more about Symantec Caf&eacute; by visiting the Web site shown

the Web of the future, where Web surfers will be immersed in real-time
interaction.
<H3><A NAME="WallStreetWeb">WallStreetWeb</A></H3>
<P>
The WallStreetWeb applet is shown in Figure 3.18. Not only can
the WallStreetWeb applet help you keep tabs on the stock market
in real time-it also allows you to track a stock's history and
trends at a glance while keeping pace with current data. This
applet hints at what is to come as applets with real-time streaming
become a part of everyday life on the Web.

<P>
The Celebrity Painter applet, shown in Figure 3.19, is a paint
program with a twist. Instead of painting in a specific color,
your brush paints with a palette based on a celebrity's picture.
This allows you to paint in the hair of one celebrity, the eyes
of another celebrity, the nose of another celebrity, and so on
for some really comical masterpieces.

A feature attraction at SportsZone is the Fantasy sports games
programmed in Java. Because it was baseball season when I visited
SportsZone, the Fantasy Baseball applet was available to create
my dream team. This applet is shown in Figure 3.24. If you want
to play fantasy baseball, visit SportsZone. I hope it will continue

As you start on the journey to become a successful Java developer,
you should visit the sites featured in this chapter. The Web has
a wealth of Java-related resources to visit, study, and learn
from. Navigating the Web is easy if you understand the principles
of hypertext linking and URLs. Although hypertext references can
be text or graphics based, they are all defined by URLs that specify
the path to the resources to be accessed and retrieved. Because
the Web provides a common interface to the Internet, you can use
any Internet protocol to access and retrieve Web resources.
