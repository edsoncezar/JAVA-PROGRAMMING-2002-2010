height of the imaginary rectangle. The last two parameters are the distance in the x-
and y-axis to copy the area. Suppose that you want to copy the area in figure 9.13 to
another area as shown in the figure. You can perform this by using the following:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
      g.copyArea(10, 10, 50, 50, 90, 90);

} // end paint
</PRE>

<P>To clear a specific area, you use the
clearRect() method. This clears a rectangular area
of the specified dimensions and fills it with the background color. The dimensions
specified for clearRect() are the same as that specified for the
drawRect() and fillRect() methods; that is, 
</P>

Figure 9.13 <I>Copying an area.</I>
</P>

<P>
the first two parameters are the x- and y-coordinates of the top-left-hand corner of
the rectangle, and the third and fourth parameters are the width and height of the
rectangle area to be cleared.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-334"><P>Page 334</P></A>



<P>If, for example, you want to create the effect of moving the area in figure 9.13, instead
of copying it, you would have to clear the original area. You could do this by using
the following:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
      g.copyArea(10, 10, 50, 50, 90, 90);
      g.clearRect(10, 10, 50, 50);

} // end paint
</PRE>

<P>If you need to clear the entire applet, first get the dimensions of the applet. You can
get the dimensions by invoking the size() for the instance of the applet by using
this.size(). The size() method is inherited by your applet from the
Component class, and it returns an instance of the class
Dimension. The Component class is one of the superclasses in
the inheritance hierarchy chain for the Applet class.
</P>

<P>The Dimension object is returned by a number of other methods in the java.awt
package, and it is a convenient way of specifying dimensions such as a rectangular area as
an object. The top-level specification of Dimension is included here to assist in
understanding its behavior:
</P>

<PRE>
public class Dimension extends Object
{
      // Public constructors
      public Dimension();
      public Dimension(Dimension d);
      public Dimension(int width, int height);

      // Public instance variables
      public int height;
      public int width;

      // Public instance methods
      public String toString(); // Overrides Object.toString();

} // end Dimension
</PRE>


<P>Therefore, to get the width and height of a class, you could use the following:
</P>

<PRE>
this.size().width                    // Gets the width
</PRE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-335"><P>Page 335</P></A>


<PRE>
this.size().height                    // Gets the height
</PRE>

<P>In the preceding statements this.size() returns a Dimension object, so you can access
the public instance variables width and height of this object. The Dimension object is
a temporary object and is created each time
this.size() is called, which is a little
inefficient. The following paint() method shows the applet area being cleared and filled with
the background color, using only a single instance of the Dimension class:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
      Dimension d = this.size();

      g.clearRect(0, 0, d.width, d.height);

} // end paint
</PRE>

Setting Background and Foreground Colors
</A></H4>

<P>When you clear a rectangle by using the
clearRect() method, the cleared area is filled
with the background color. By default, this color is a dark gray. If you want to use a
different background color, you must use the
setBackground() method. There is also a
corresponding setForeground() method that sets the foreground color. Both of these methods are
inherited by your applet from the Component class. They both take a single argument that is
of instance Color. To change the background of the applet to a yellow color, for
example, you would use the following:
</P>

<PRE>
setBackground(Color.yellow);
</PRE>

<P>When you use setForeground(), you change the color of all text or graphic elements
that have been drawn in a single stroke. To change the color of all graphic elements that
have been drawn to pink without redrawing the applet, for example, you would use
the following:
</P>
<PRE>
setForeground(Color.pink);
</PRE>

<P>You have already seen the use of the setColor() method defined in the Graphics class
(see lines 46_50 of listing 9.1) to set the color for all future drawing operations. You can
also use the getColor method defined in the Graphics class (see lines 42_43 of listing 9.1)
to obtain the current color setting. To change the foreground color of the applet to
the current color setting, for example, you could use the following:
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-336"><P>Page 336</P></A>


<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{

      // Other statements for setting
      // colors of the applet

      // Now change everything to the last
      // color setting.
      setForeground(g.getColor());

} // end paint
</PRE>

Getting Font Information
</A></H4>

<P>When you are writing text in an applet, you can set the font by using the call to
the setFont() method that is inherited from the Component class. The
setFont() method takes an instance of the Font object. In the program listings in Chapter 8, &quot;Creating
Java Applets,&quot; you saw examples of creating the Font object. You can query the Font
object by calling its methods. A top-level description of these Font methods is shown next:
</P>

<PRE>
public class Font
{
 public static final int PLAIN     = 0;
 public static final int BOLD          = 1;
 public static final int ITALIC     = 2;

 //
 // The logical name of this font.
 protected String name;

 //
 // The style of the font. This is the sum of the
 // constants PLAIN, BOLD, or ITALIC.
 protected int style;

 //
 // The point size of this font.
 protected int size;

 //

</PRE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-337"><P>Page 337</P></A>



<PRE>
 // Creates a new font with the specified name, style
 // and point size.
 // name = the font name
 // style = the constant style used
 // size = the point size of the font
 public Font(String name, int style, int size);

 //
 // Gets the platform specific family name of the font.
 // Use getName to get the logical name of the font.
 public String getFamily();


 //
 // Gets the logical name of the font.
 public String getName();

 //
 // Gets the style of the font.
 public int getStyle();

 //
 // Gets the point size of the font.
 public int getSize();

 //
 // Returns true if the font is plain.
 public boolean isPlain();

 //
 // Returns true if the font is bold.
 public boolean isBold();

 //
 // Returns true if the font is italic.
 public boolean isItalic();
