<H2>

Animating Applets <BR>with Java Graphics, <BR>Images, Colors,
and <BR>Sound

</H2>

<P><B>I</B>n the previous chapter, you learned about the basic structure of an 
applet and how to write simple applets. However, because you had 
not yet learned about how to draw graphic elements, there was
not much you could do with these applets.
</P>

<P>In this chapter, you will learn the basics of using Java's built-in
graphic primitives to produce lines, shapes, images, and sounds. You will
use Java's graphic primitives to produce more interesting applets. You
will also learn about multithreading and how this concept can be used in
Java applets and applications. You will learn to produce applets that
include sound, image animation, and interaction with the user.

Overview of the Graphics Class
</A></H3>

<P>Most of the drawing methods in Java are defined as methods in the Graphics class.
The Graphics class is part of the package java.awt, and you can access it by importing
this class:
</P>

<PRE>
import     java.awt.Graphics;
</PRE>

<P>You can use these methods to draw lines, shapes, text strings, and images on the
display area of your applet. You do not have to create an instance of the Graphics object
within the applet code to have access to the drawing methods. Recall the definition of the
paint() method that you wrote in the simple Java applets of the previous chapter:
</P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
      // Your code

} // end paint
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>The instance of the Graphics object is passed to you by the Web browser when it
calls the paint() method. This Graphics object instance is created by the Web browser.
Because it is passed to the applet through the
paint() method, you do not have to create a
separate instance of the Graphics class.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch09_ 3">
Understanding the Graphics Coordinates
</A></H4>

<P>Many of the methods in the Graphics class make use of a coordinate system to
define the location of points, graphic elements, and so on. This coordinate system is the
familiar X_Y plane used in geometry, except that the X-axis starts at the top-left-hand corner
of the display area and with increasing values of X, proceeds to the top-right corner of
the display area. The Y-axis also starts at the top-left-hand corner of the display area
and with increasing values of Y, proceeds to the bottom-left corner of the display area
(see fig. 9.1).

Examining the Graphics Class
</A></H4>

<P>The Graphics class is very extensive and provides a device-independent interface to
the graphics capabilities in Java. It contains many methods to draw lines, images,
copy areas, and so on. If you are going to be adding graphical appeal to your applets,
chances are that you will end up using one of the methods in the Graphics class. You will
have access to the Graphics methods in applets through the instance of the Graphics
class that is passed as a parameter to the applet's
paint() method.
</P>

<P>Because the Graphics class is important for drawing applets, listing 9.1 is the skeleton
of the Graphics class for your reference. The code in listing 9.1 looks like Java code, and
it contains the description of all the methods and parameters needed to call a
Graphic method. It is not really syntactically correct Java code because the body of the code
for the methods has been omitted for reasons of space and because it is not important
for learning to use the Graphics class. You should quickly review this description of
the Graphics class (even though it is, unfortunately, several pages long!) to get an idea
of the methods that are available for your use. You can come back and review these
method definitions later in detail when writing the Graphics code. Note that you have
already learned to use some of the Graphics methods such
as setColor(), setFont(), and drawString() in Chapter 8, &quot;Creating Java Applets.&quot;
