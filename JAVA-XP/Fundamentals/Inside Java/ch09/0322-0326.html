The following is the paint() method to draw the figures in 9.4. The top-left-hand corners
of the rounded rectangles are assumed to start at the following locations:

<P>Note that a solid circle is drawn by the last statement. A circle is drawn when the
width, height, arcWidth, and arcHeight are the same.

Drawing 3D Rectangles
</A></H4>

<P>You can use the Graphics class to simulate three-dimensional rectangles. These
rectangles produce a shadow effect that make them appear three-dimensional.
</P>

<P>What if, for example, you want to draw two rectangles: one that is filled with a color
and looks like a raised 3D button and the other that is in an outline form but appears
pressed. To create these 3D rectangles, you will use the
fill3DRect() method (see lines 176_181 of listing 9.1) and the
draw3DRect() method (see lines 169_173 of listing 9.1).
</P>

<P>The arguments to these methods are the &lt;x,y&gt; coordinate of the top-left-hand corner,
the width of the rectangle and the height of the rectangle, and a Boolean argument. If
the Boolean argument is true, the rectangle is raised; otherwise, the rectangle is indented.
</P>

<P>The following is the paint() method that produces a solid-raised rectangle and an
outline-indented rectangle.

Drawing Ovals
</A></H4>

<P>You can use the Graphics class to draw ellipses and circles. You can also produce
the same effect by using rounded rectangles, except that the use of the oval method is
easier to use to produce ellipses and circles.
</P>

<P>Consider, for example, that you want to draw two ovals, one that is a circle filled with
a color, and the other that is an ellipse in an outline form (see fig. 9.6). To create these
oval shapes, you will use the fillOval() method (see lines 190_193 of listing 9.1) and the
drawOval() method (see lines 184_187 of listing 9.1).

</P>

<P>The arguments to these methods are the &lt;x,y&gt; coordinate of the top-left-hand corner,
the width of the oval, and the height of the oval. The following is the
paint() method to produce the shapes in figure 9.6:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
      g.fillOval(10, 10, 20, 20);
      g.drawOval(50, 10, 20, 40);

} // end paint

Drawing Arcs
</A></H4>

<P>Arcs are segments of the circumference of an oval. To define an arc, you must first see
it as part of an oval (see fig. 9.7). The arc is only a portion of the oval.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-324"><P>Page 324</P></A>



<P>The arc drawing methods are drawArc() (see lines 196_206 in listing 9.1) and
fillArc() (see lines 209_216 in listing 9.1). The first four parameters for drawing an arc are the same
as that of an imaginary oval of which the arc is part. The fifth parameter is the start angle
of the arc. The start angle is measured with respect to the center of the circle. Zero
degrees is at the 3 o'clock line; 90 degrees is at the 12 o'clock line; 180 degrees is at the 9
o'clock line; and 270 degrees is at the 6 o'clock line (see fig. 9.8). The sixth, and last parameter,
is the arc angle, and it is the number of degrees that you must &quot;sweep&quot; from the start
angle to create the arc. A positive value of the arc angle will result in a
counter-clockwise motion, and a negative value will result in a clockwise motion.
</P>

<P>To draw the arc, for example, which is the top half of the circle (see fig. 9.9), you
would

use the following paint() method:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
         g.drawArc(10, 10, 50, 50, 0, 180);

} // end paint
</PRE>

<P>You can draw the arc from either end points of the arc. Therefore, the arc in figure 9.9
can also be drawn by starting from the opposite point as shown in the following
paint() method:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
         g.drawArc(10, 10, 50, 50, 180, -180);

} // end paint
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the start angle is 180 degrees, but the arc angle has a negative sweep to

<P>cause a motion in the clockwise direction.
</P>

<P>You can also draw a filled arc by invoking the
fillArc() method. To draw the filled elliptical arc, for example, shown in figure 9.10, you would use the following
paint() method:
</P>

<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
         g.fillArc(20, 20, 40, 30, 200, 30);

} // end paint

Drawing Polygons
</A></H4>

Figure 9.10 <I>Filled arc to be  drawn.</I>
</P>

<P>Polygons are arbitrary shapes with many sides drawn by straight lines. Familiar
figures, such as squares, rectangles, triangles, pentagons, and so on, are all examples of
closed polygons. Polygons are closed because they bound a region of two-dimensional space.
</P>

<P>Polygons are drawn by the methods drawPolygon() (see lines 219_230 in listing 9.1)
and fillPolygon() (see lines 316_330 in listing 9.1). These methods accept two types of
arguments&#151;arrays of x- and y-coordinates or an instance of the Polygon class.
</P>

<P>If you are using arrays, you must provide three arguments. The first argument is an
array of x-coordinates; the second argument is an array of y-coordinates; the last argument
is the number of elements in each of the two array arguments. The number of elements
in each of the x- and y-coordinate array must be the same.
</P>

<P>The polygon draw methods do not automatically close the shape. If you want a
closed shape, the last point in the array must be the same as the start point in the array. If
you draw a filled polygon, the method will join the start and end points.
</P>

<P>The following is an example of a paint() method that draws the triangle of figure 9.11:
</P>
<PRE>
public void paint(Graphics g)
{
      int[] xa = {10, 40, 25, 10};
      int[] ya = {60, 60, 10, 60};

      g.drawPolygon(xa, ya, xa.length);
