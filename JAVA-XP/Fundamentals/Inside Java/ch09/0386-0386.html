<P>produce lines, shapes, images, and sounds. You were presented with several examples
of code that used the graphics method. When writing applets to display graphics, there
are two main methods for creating the graphics: one method is to use the methods
provided by the Graphics class, and the other is to use prebuilt images that you load from a
file. You can, of course, use a combination of these techniques.
</P>

<P>In this chapter, you learned about the basics of thread creation and activation.
Thread creation is needed to produce applets with animation. The logic of painting or
changing the applet display area is done by a thread specifically designed for this purpose.
</P>

<P>You also learned how to load images and sound clips in your applet, and how to
activate these images with a minimum of screen flicker by overriding the
update() method and by using the double buffering technique.
