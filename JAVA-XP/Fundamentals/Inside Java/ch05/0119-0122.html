CHAPTER 5

<H2>

Using Java Objects <BR>
and Arrays

</H2>

<P><B>S</B>o far you have learned about basic Java data types and control
flow statements. Besides basic data types, Java contains many 
predefined classes. As you learned in Chapter 2, &quot;Getting
Started with Java,&quot; when you create an instance of a class, that instance is
called an <I>object</I>. In this chapter, you will learn how to use those objects.
Note that you have not yet learned to define a full blown class type,
although you have learned to define a simple class to encapsulate the
main() method. It is not necessary to know the full details of how a class
is defined to use classes.
</P>

<P>Sometimes one needs to access aggregates of a variable of the same
type through some kind of indexing mechanism. Java provides the
array mechanism to support indexing of aggregates of a data type. The use
of arrays has become fundamental to modern programming languages.
Any data structure that consists of cells of data is a good candidate
for representation by arrays. The mathematical concept of matrix can
be easily represented as an array.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-120"><P>Page 120</P></A>



<P>This chapter also discusses how arrays are defined in Java. You learn how to
define multidimensional arrays, how to initialize them properly, and how arrays are
different from ordinary variables. In many languages the concept of strings of characters
is represented as an array of characters. In Java the string data type is implemented by
the class String. Internally, this String class uses an array of characters for representing
the sequence of characters. By encapsulating the array of characters in a class,
however, powerful string manipulation methods become available for operating on the string
data. This chapter discusses how strings can be used in Java programs.

Using Java Objects
</A></H3>

<P>The types of Java data types that you examined in Chapter 3, &quot;Experimenting with
Java Data Types and Variables,&quot; have been simple &quot;unadorned&quot; data types such as
integers, floating point data, Booleans, and characters. These basic data types are available
in most languages. One of the things that distinguishes Java as a programming language
is its object-oriented nature that enables the use of a higher level representation of
data called an <I>object</I>. An object is a collection of data items along with the methods
(programs or functions) that operate upon the data.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 3">
Creating Objects
</A></H4>

<P>For an object, the format of the data and the definitions of the methods that
operate upon the data are described by a class. A class, in Java, is a template for how the
object is to be constructed. Creating an object from the data template represented by the
class is called creating an <I>instance</I> of the class. The object instance is assigned a name that
is similar to the names used for variables of the basic Java data types. This name is
called the <I>object name</I>.
</P>

<P>The object name can be of any length. Some limitations exist on the characters you
can use to create the object name. The object name, like a variable name in Java, must
begin with a letter, followed by any combination of letters and digits. A letter is a
<I>set</I> consisting of letters a_z, A_Z and the underscore (_) and dollar ($) characters.
</P>

<P>Recall that if you needed to create a variable of a basic Java data type, you could use
the type name followed by the variable names as shown in the following example:
</P>

<PRE>
int     aVarName;
float     area;
char     inpCh;
</PRE>

<P>If you need to create an object instance, the syntax is similar to creating a variable
name. You, however, must also use a
<I>constructor</I> for that object. What is a constructor? A
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-121"><P>Page 121</P></A>



<P><I>constructor</I> is a special method that contains the program code to build the
object. Building the object may involve initializing the data elements in the object. All
classes must have this constructor method. If one has not been defined, the Java
language supplies this default constructor. The name of the constructor method is the same as
the name of the class. Consider a class called Aircraft:
</P>

<PRE>
class Aircraft
{
// Data elements describing the class

// Constructor method
Aircraft() {&#133;}
}
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the following line in the preceding class definition is the constructor method:
</P>
<PRE>
Aircraft() {&#133;}
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the name of the constructor method is the same as the class name&#151;this
is what is used to identify the constructor method.
</P>

<P>The { &#133; } contains the statements that implement the constructor method. The
parentheses after Aircraft and before the { &#133; } contain the arguments to the method.
<I>Arguments</I> are data that is passed on to the method.
</P>

<P>To create an object of this class&#151;called instantiating the class&#151;you can use
the following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>
Aircraft     boeing_747 = new Aircraft();
</PRE>

<P>The object name is boeing_747. The = new
Aircraft()  initializes the object with the object created by the constructor. Notice that the call to the
Aircraft() constructor is preceded with new. Whenever you call a constructor to create an object you must precede it
with the new keyword.
</P>

<P>The object boeing_747 could also have been created in two steps, as shown next:
</P>
<PRE>
Aircraft     boeing_747;
boeing_747 = new Aircraft();
</PRE>

<P>The statement Aircraft boeing_747; just declares the variable; it does not define the
variable. No object is associated with this variable; it is a reference to nothing. More
specifically, the variable is set to the value of null. The reserved word null is used to indicate that
no object is associated with the boeing_747. The second statement
boeing_747 = new Aircraft(); defines the value of the object.

Creating and Using Objects of the Date Class
</A></H4>

<P>Figure 5.1 shows the definition of the class Date defined in the
package java.util, which uses javadoc and an HTML browser. From the discussion in Chapter 4, &quot;Java
Flow

Figure 5.1
<I>Date constructor definition.</I>
</P>

<P>Control,&quot; recall that packages are collections of classes that have similar functions.
</P>

<P>Listing 5.1 contains a program that uses the Date class, and figure 5.2 shows the
output of this program by using the java interpreter. This program is in the file DateUse.java
on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.
</P>

<P>Line 18 in listing 5.1 defines a simple use of the creation of the Date object,
todate. The constructor &quot;Date()&quot; that is used to build the Date object does not have any
arguments. This type of Date constructor returns the current date and time information. Line
19 contains a printout of the date value. From figure 5.2, you can see that the date is
printed out as the following:
</P>

<PRE>
Fri Jul 19 11:49:05 Mountain Daylight Time 1996
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the System.out.println() method, on line 19, is able to print out the date object.
It can do this because all Java objects have a method called
toString() that converts the object's value to a string representation. The Date class has an explicit method
called toString() that converts the date object's value to a string representation. An
<I>explicit method</I> is a method that is defined in the class itself, and it is different from an
<I>implicit</I>
