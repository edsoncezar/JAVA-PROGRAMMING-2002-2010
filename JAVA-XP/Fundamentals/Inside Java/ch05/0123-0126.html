<P><I>method</I> that is inherited from a parent class. You will learn about how methods can
be inherited in later chapters.
</P>

<P>The System.out.println() method was used often in the previous chapters. You are in a
better position to understand this method now that the use of objects has been
formally introduced. Java has a class called System, defined in the package java.lang, that
has only static variables and methods. Two of the very important static variables are in
and out. The variables in and out define objects of the class InputStream and
PrintStream, respectively. Because out is an instance of the class PrintStream, all the methods that
are available for PrintStream can be invoked by using this notation:
</P>
<PRE>
Object.method();
</PRE>

<P>In this example, <I>Object</I> is the object
System.out and <I>method</I> is println().
</P>

<P>Lines 21_23 contain the definition of the objects
date1, date2, and date3. Notice that in these definitions, the objects are initialized to a null value. On line 25, the value of the
date1 object is printed out. From figure 5.2, you can see that the value printed out is the
string &quot;null&quot;:
</P>

<PRE>
Printing undefined date value null
</PRE>

<P>All the predefined Java classes are written with the consideration that if an attempt
is made to access an undefined value, a value of null is set for the object.
</P>

<P>Lines 27_29 initialize the date objects with values built by calling the constructors
for date. Each of these lines represents a different constructor for the class Date. Note
that the constructors have the same name Date, but different arguments, and this makes
them different. In general, methods that have the same name but different arguments
are
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-124"><P>Page 124</P></A>


<P>
distinct from each other. This capability to have several methods with the same name
is called <I>method overloading</I>.
</P>


<P>The Date constructor on line 27 is past arguments of
<I>year</I>, <I>month,</I> and <I>date</I>. The year
is the number of years since the year 1900; month is the month number&#151;January is
month number 0 and December is month number 11; date is the day of the month with
values from 1 to 31. The object date's value is printed out by line 31:
</P>
<PRE>
First date is Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 Mountain Standard Time 2000
</PRE>

<P>The Date constructor on line 28 is past arguments of
<I>year</I>, <I>month</I>, <I>date</I>,
<I>hours</I>, and <I>minutes</I>. The <I>year</I>,
<I>month,</I> and <I>date</I> have the same values described for the previous
date constructor, but <I>hours</I> and
<I>minutes</I> have the expected value of the hour of the day,
and minutes in the hour. The value of <I>hours</I> can be from 0 to 23, and
<I>minutes</I> is from 0 to 59. The object date2's value is printed out by line 32:
</P>
<PRE>
Second date is Mon Oct 16 12:55:00 Mountain Daylight Time 2000
</PRE>

<P>The Date constructor on line 29 is past arguments of
<I>year</I>, <I>month</I>, <I>date</I>,
<I>hours</I>, <I>minutes,</I> and <I>seconds</I>. The
<I>year</I>, <I>month</I>, <I>date</I>,
<I>hours</I>, and <I>minutes</I> have the same values
described for the previous date constructor, but
<I>seconds</I> has the expected value of the seconds
in the next minute. The value of <I>seconds</I> can be from 0 to 59. The object date3's value
is printed out by line 33:
</P>
<PRE>
Third date is Sun Dec 31 23:59:59 Mountain Standard Time 2000
</PRE>

<P>Lines 35 and 37 show how you can get the number of milliseconds since midnight for
a particular date object value. Line 35 defines the long variable m that will contain
the number of milliseconds. Line 37 contains a call to the method
getTime(). The method getTime() is defined for the class Date and returns the number of milli-<BR>
seconds since midnight. You can use the javadoc utility to get information on
the method. Figure 5.3 shows the description of the
getTime() method by using Internet Explorer after creating the HTML files with javadoc. How do you know what type
of variable should be defined for holding the millisecond value? Examining figure 5.3,
you can see the following definition of getTime():
</P>
<PRE>
public long getTime()
</PRE>

<P>The type of value returned is indicated by the data type that precedes the name of
the method. In this example, the data type is long, and hence you must define the variable
to receive the method value as being a long type. Line 38 prints out the value of the
number of milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time):
</P>
<PRE>
Milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970 = 837798545230
</PRE>

<P>Lines 41_49 compute the date, which is 333 days from today's date. To do this, the
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-125"><P>Page 125</P></A>



<P>number of milliseconds in a day is computed and stored in
msPerDay. Line 46 sets the futureDate to todate by using an assignment statement, so the value of
futureDate is the same as todate. Next, line 47 uses the method
setTime() for class Date to change the date to a
future

setTime() method by using Internet Explorer and the HTML documents created by javadoc.
</P>

<P>Lines 49 and 50 print out the future date and today's date:
</P>

<PRE>
Future date after 333 days is Tue Jun 17 11:49:05 Mountain Daylight Time 1997
Today's date is Tue Jun 17 11:49:05 Mountain Daylight Time 1997
</PRE>

<P>Lines 52_66 check the value of the future date to see if it is different from today's date
as one would expect. The method used to perform this check is the
equals() method. Again,

</P>

<P>you can use the documentation generated by javadoc to see the definition of
this method (see fig. 5.5).
</P>

<P>The output in figure 5.2 reveals that something strange has taken place&#151;the value of
the today's date was somehow changed to that of the future date:
</P>
<PRE>
Today's date is Tue Jun 17 11:49:05 Mountain Daylight Time 1997
This is indeed strange! Let's verify it.
Examining todays date again:
            It's Tue Jun 17 11:49:05 Mountain Daylight Time 1997
            Why is the future date the same as todays date?
</PRE>

<P>As you examine the code from lines 44_50, apparently no change has been made 
to the future date. This mysterious change is due to a very important aspect of
how object variable values are set in Java. Figure 5.6 shows the
futureDate and todate variable values prior to making the assignment on line 46. Notice that although
todate has a reference to the object that was created when the constructor was called on line
18, futureDate does not have any such reference. When an object is declared, as in line 44,
and
