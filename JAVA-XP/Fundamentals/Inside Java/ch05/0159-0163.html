Arrays of Objects
</A></H4>

<P>An array is an object within Java. Each element of the array can be a Java basic type or
a classname. In the latter case, arrays can be used to store Java objects. The array
then becomes a Java object that contains other Java objects.
</P>

<P>All array objects have a variable length associated with them that can be used
to determine the size (also called <I>length</I>) of the array. To get the length of the array,
you can use the following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>
arrayname.length;
</PRE>

<P>Consider the following sample program:
</P>
<PRE>
int[] xi = new int[50];
char[] xc = {`E', `L', ` `, `M', `O', `R', `Y', `A'};
float[] xf = {_3.0F, 2.0F, 9.7F, 9.02F, 344.23F};
short[] xs;

int xsLength;

xsLength = xc.length + xf.length;
xs = new short[xsLength];

System.out.println(&quot;xi length = &quot;+xi.length);
System.out.println(&quot;xc length = &quot;+xc.length);
System.out.println(&quot;xf length = &quot;+xf.length);
System.out.println(&quot;xs length = &quot;+xs.length);
The output of the preceding code fragment would be:
xi length = 50
xc length = 8
xf length = 5
xs length = 13
</PRE>

<P>Consider another example, where you need to create an array of nine objects.
Assume that the object is defined by the class Aircraft that has been defined elsewhere, and
that this class has a single constructor with no arguments
Aircraft().
</P>
<PRE>
Aircraft[] flights = new Aircraft[9];
</PRE>

<P>The preceding statement defines the array flights of nine elements. The array object
is instantiated, and each element in the array is the type of the class Aircraft. At this
point each element of the array is ready to hold an Aircraft object, but these objects must
be instantiated in a separate step by calling the constructor for the class Aircraft.
The
</P>

<P>following illustrates how this can be done:
</P>

<PRE>
for (int x = 0; x &lt; 9; x++)
{
flights[x] = new Aircraft();

} // end for
</PRE>

<P>This loop will instantiate each of the elements of the array and assign it to a cell in
the array flights.
</P>

<P>In preceding examples of array definitions where the element type of the array is a
Java basic type, there was no need to call a constructor for each element. This is because
Java basic types are instantiated by declaring them; that is, space for Java data types
need not be defined in a separate step. Java objects behave differently from Java basic
data types. For Java objects a constructor must be called to instantiate the object.
</P>

<P>A question that you may ask is what is stored in each of the cells in the array when
the following array is defined, but before each of the array objects is instantiated separately?
</P>
<PRE>
    Aircraft[] flights = new Aircraft[9];

</P>

<P>Figure 5.16 shows a graphical description of the array before each element object in
the array is instantiated. Notice that each cell contains an object reference that has the
value of null. Consider figure 5.17, which shows the appearance of the array after each
element has been instantiated. In this case, each array element contains a reference to
the instantiated object.

Java uses pointers (addresses) internally to store references to objects, and for
elements of an array of objects. These pointers, however, are used internally in Java, and are
not available for programmer use.

Defining Multidimensional Arrays
</A></H4>

<P>So far, all the examples of arrays use single-dimensional arrays. Many problems
may require multidimensional arrays, such as matrix representation or representation of
a simple spreadsheet. Another example would be if you wanted to store the best
timings for a given number of athletes of swimmers for several competitive events. The idea of
a two-dimensional array is shown in figure 5.18. There are two indexes, one that
indexes the columns, and the other that indexes the rows. For the cell that has a row index of
x, and a column index of y, the cell is referenced by
</P>
<PRE>
    mat[x][y]

Figure 5.19
<I>Array of array objects.</I>
</P>

<P>If this matrix has 10 rows and 12 columns, it is defined by using either of the
following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>
int mat[][] = new int[10][12];
</PRE>

<P>or
</P>
<PRE>
int[][] mat = new int[10][12];
</PRE>

<P>The actual array that is created is an array of arrays as shown in figure 5.19. Each of
the elements of the array mat[0] to mat[9] contains another array object that has 12 elements
of
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-163"><P>Page 163</P></A>



<P>type int.
</P>

<P>You can extend this idea to an array of any dimensions. An array of four dimensions,
for example, could be defined as either of the following:
</P>
<PRE>
int matx[][][][] = new int[10][20][30][40];
</PRE>

<P>or
</P>
<PRE>
int[][][][] matx = new int[10][20][30][40];
</PRE>

<P>You can even define variable size arrays of arrays as long as the first dimension of
the array has been specified beforehand. Consider the following example:
</P>
<PRE>
int xa[][] = new int[6][];
</PRE>

<BR>

<P><a href="images\ch05fg20.jpg"><img src="images\tn_ch05fg20.jpg"></a><BR>
Figure 5.20
<I>Variable sized array.</I>
</P>

<PRE>
xa[0] = new int[10];
xa[1] = new int[12];
xa[2] = new int[5];
xa[3] = new int[4];
xa[4] = new int[6];
xa[5] = new int[5];
</PRE>

<P>The declaration of int xa[][] = new int[6][] creates a 6 element array. Each element of the
array is a reference to another array that has yet to be instantiated. These secondary arrays
are instantiated in the separate assignment statements. Figure 5.20 shows a
graphical representation of the variable sized array. You must be careful how you index this
array. If you exceed the valid index range, an exception will be raised.
