<UL>
<LI>          public String toString()
<LI>          public boolean equals(Object obj)
<LI>          public int hashCode()
</UL>

<P>The classtype is the name of the type wrapper classes such as Boolean, Character,
Double, Float, Integer, Long; the basictype is the name of the corresponding basic type such
as Boolean, character, double, float, int, long.
</P>

<P>The first method type &quot;public
classtype(basictype)&quot; is used as a constructor to build an
object of the classtype. The following are examples of how this can be used:
</P>
<PRE>
Integer ic = new Integer(99);
Boolean btrue = new Boolean(true);
Character cc = new Character(`K');
Float     fc = new Float(3.14159F);
Double dc = new Double(1.414);
</PRE>

<P>After the objects of the type wrapper class have been created, you can use the
methods for that class on that object.
</P>

<P>The second method type &quot;public basictype classtype
Value()&quot; is used to extract the native Java basic data type value from the type wrapper class. Before performing any arithmetic
or Boolean operations, you must extract the value of these basic types. The examples
below extract the basic type values from each of the type wrapper classes defined in
the previous example:
</P>
<PRE>
int iv = ic.intValue(); // Set to 99
boolean bv = btrue.booleanValue(); // Set to true
char cv = cc.charValue(); // Set to `K'
float fv = fc.floatValue(); // Set to 3.14159F
double dv = dc.doubleValue();     // Set to 1.414
</PRE>

<P>The third method type &quot;public String
toString()&quot; is used to convert the value stored in
the type wrapper class to an equivalent string representation. This method is primarily
used for creating string representations of the Java data types for display or storing them
into a text file. The examples below can be used to display the data types on the console.
</P>
<PRE>
System.out.println(ic.toString());
System.out.println(btrue.toString());
System.out.println(cc.toString());
</PRE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-139"><P>Page 139</P></A>


<PRE>
System.out.println(fc.toString());
System.out.println(dc.toString());
</PRE>

<P>The fourth method type &quot;public boolean equals(Object
obj)&quot; is used to test if the value in one type wrapper object is the same as the one in another type wrapper object. This
method is a convenient way to check the equality of values contained in the wrapper
objects. Note that you cannot use the equals operator (==) to compare two class objects.
The following example shows the use of this method.
</P>

<PRE>
Integer ic1 = new Integer(33);
Integer ic2 = new Integer(33);
Integer ic3 = new Integer(44);

if (ic1.equals(ic2))
{
System.out.println(&quot;ic1 equals ic2&quot;);
}
else
{
System.out.println(&quot;ic1 not equal to ic2&quot;);

} // end if

boolean test = ic2.equals(ic3);
System.out.println(test);
</PRE>

<P>The output that will be displayed by running the preceding code fragment will be:
</P>

<PRE>
ic1 equals ic2
false
</PRE>

<P>The fifth common method type &quot;public int
hashCode()&quot; is used to return an internal
integer value that contains a value that is a mathematical summation of the value that is
encapsulated in the type wrapper class. The hash code is used for operations with
the Hashtable class in package java.util.
</P>

<P><B>
The Boolean Type Wrapper Class
</B></P>

<P>The Boolean type wrapper, because it encapsulates either a true or false value, does
not implement any other methods besides the common methods discussed in the
previous
</P>

<P>section. The Boolean class has two public static variables defined as follows within
that class:
</P>
<PRE>
public static final boolean TRUE = new boolean(true);
public static final boolean FALSE = new boolean(false);
</PRE>

<P>These statements define TRUE and FALSE as Boolean objects, containing the
Boolean value TRUE and FALSE, respectively. The use of the reserved words public, static,
and final as qualifiers for these types has an interesting meaning.
</P>

<P>The use of the reserved word public before a method declaration or class variable
definition, makes the method or variable accessible to programs outside that class. In
this case, the objects TRUE and FALSE are available for use outside the Boolean class.
</P>

<P>The use of the reserved word static for a class variable makes the variable available to
all instances of that class. In other words, all object instances will share the same copy
of the static object. Because the variable is not especially associated with any
particular object instance, you can access the variable without defining an instance of this
class. You could, for example, access these Boolean objects by using the following notation:
</P>
<PRE>
boolean.TRUE
boolean.FALSE
</PRE>

<P>Notice that Boolean is the name of the class and not the name of an object instance
of that class.
</P>

<P>The use of the reserved word final for a class variable makes the variable constant.
In other words, the value of the constant variable cannot be modified. Therefore,
any attempts to modify the values of the Boolean objects TRUE and FALSE will be
caught by the compiler and the runtime Java environment.
</P>

<P><B>
The Character Type Wrapper Class
</B></P>

<P>Besides the common methods for type wrapper classes, the Character class
provides additional methods that are all static. Because these methods are all static, they can
be invoked without creating an object instance of the Character class, using the
following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>
Character.method(args);
</PRE>

<P>The following are the additional Character methods:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>         public static boolean isLowerCase(char ch)
<LI>          public static boolean isUpperCase(char ch)
<LI>          public static int digit(char ch, int radix)
</OL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-141"><P>Page 141</P></A>


<OL START="4">
<LI>          public static boolean isDigit(char ch)
<LI>          public static char forDigit(char ch)
<LI>          public static char toLowerCase(char ch)
<LI>          public static char toUpperCase(char ch)
<LI>          public static char isSpace(char ch)
</OL>

<P>The descriptions of these methods are in table 5.1. Some examples of the use of
these methods are the following:
</P>

<PRE>
Character chc1 = new Character(`F');
Character chc2 = new Character(`f');

if (Character.isLowerCase(chc1))
{
System.out.println(&quot;chc1 is lower case&quot;);
}
else if (Character.isUpperCase(chc1))
{
System.out.println(&quot;chc1 is upper case&quot;);

} // end if

if (Character.isLowerCase(chc2))
{
System.out.println(&quot;chc2 is lower case&quot;);
}
else if (Character.isUpperCase(chc2))
{
System.out.println(&quot;chc2 is upper case&quot;);

} // end if

Character cdgt1 = new Character(`2');

if (Character.isDigit(cdgt1))
{
System.out.println(&quot;cdgt1 is a digit&quot;);
}
</PRE>
