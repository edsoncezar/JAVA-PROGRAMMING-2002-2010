Defining HTML Documents to Run
Applets
</A></H4>

<P>The subject of defining HTML documents can fill an entire book. The goal in this
section is to present only sufficient elements of HTML to show how applet specifications can
be embedded in an HTML document.
</P>

<P>

<B>On the
CD</B><BR>
Listing 8.2 (file HelloAppletWorld.html on the CD-ROM accompanying this book)
shows an example of an HTML document for running the HelloWorld program defined in
the previous section. The line numbers in this listing are for reference purposes only, and
are not part of the HTML document.
</P>

<P>HTML documents consist of <I>tags</I> enclosed in angular brackets:
</P>

<PRE>
&lt;tag&gt;
</PRE>

<P>A tag is used to specify the type of data that is encoded in the document. Most
tags have an end-of-tag specifier that marks the end-of-tag definition. These
end-of-tag specifiers have the following format:
</P>

<PRE>
&lt;/tag&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Spaces and lines outside a set of tag specifiers are usually not significant.
</P>

<P>Lines 1 and 15 of listing 8.2 define the tags &lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt;, respectively.
These tags specify that everything between these tag specifiers is part of an HTML document.
</P>

<P>Lines 2 and 4 of listing 8.2 define tags &lt;HEAD&gt; and &lt;/HEAD&gt;, respectively. These
tags specify the head of the HTML document. Within this head specification is the
&lt;TITLE&gt; and &lt;/TITLE&gt; tags on line 3. Inside the &lt;TITLE&gt; specification is the string
&quot;A simple HelloWorld Applet&quot;. This title will be displayed as the title of the HTML document in
the Web browser.
</P>

<P>Lines 6 and 14 of listing 8.2 define tags &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt;, respectively. These
tags specify the body of the HTML document that will be rendered as a graphics document
in the Web browser.
</P>

<P>On line 7 is the tag specifier &lt;P&gt; that defines a new paragraph. The end &lt;/P&gt;
tag specifying the end of the paragraph has been left out because it is optional.
</P>

<P>The tag &lt;BR&gt; on line 8 causes a line break, and displays the contents that follow on
a new line. Lines 10_13 define the applet. Note that these contain the
&lt;APPLET <I>attributes</I>&gt; and the end of applet specification tag &lt;/APPLET&gt;.
</P>

<P>The <I>attributes</I> in the applet tag can contain a number of attribute specifications.
In this example, only three attributes, CODE, WIDTH, and HEIGHT are defined.
A number of other attributes can also be specified. These are discussed in later
examples in this chapter. 
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-289"><P>Page 289</P></A>


<P>The CODE=&quot;<I>URL&quot;</I> attribute specifies the URL location of the applet code. This
URL location specifies the file that contains the applet class. Note that this file contains
the byte code for the applet and must be specified by using the
.class extension. In this case, the class file is in the same directory as the HTML file. If the class file is in a
different directory than the HTML file, you can use the
CODEBASE=&quot;<I>directory</I>&quot; attribute to specify the different directory.
</P>

<P>The WIDTH and HEIGHT specify in pixels the width and height of the
bounding rectangle that contains the applet. It is used to specify how big a box to draw for
the applet. You should specify appropriate sizes for the applet, taking into account how
big a graphics object is painted by the applet. The
resize() method can be called from within the applet code to resize these dimensions.
</P>

<P>The text between the &lt;APPLET
<I>attributes</I>&gt; and &lt;/APPLET&gt; tags is optional. If
specified, this text is displayed by non-Java-enabled browsers. In the example in listing 8.2,
the following statement will appear in non-Java-enabled browsers, where the applet
would normally be displayed:
</P>

<P>
You will not know what you are missing unless you upgrade your browser to a
Java-enabled browser! You should display a similar message (probably a less obnoxious
one!) to indicate the fact that the applet cannot be run in the user's browser.

Running Applets

<P>You can use the Applet Viewer application included with the JDK or any
Java-enabled browser to run the applet.

<B>On the
CD</B><BR>
You can run the applet with Applet Viewer by using the following steps:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>          After you have copied the contents of the HelloAppletWorld directory from the
CD-ROM (at the back of this book) to your local disk, you should build the .class file
by running the Java compiler.
<LI>          From the directory in which you copied the code, type
<B>javac HelloAppletWorld.java</B>.
<LI>          After the program compiles with no errors, type
<B>appletviewer HelloAppletWorld.html</B>. The Applet Viewer should launch, and you will see
the applet display as shown in figure 8.7.
</OL>

<P>You can also start the applet in a Web browser such as Internet Explorer. You
can

Using Fonts and Colors in Applets
</A></H4>

<P>The Graphics class provides a number of classes that you can use to set the font
and colors of any text or graphic elements that you draw in the applet. You can, for
example, use the setFont() and setColor() method to draw strings with different fonts and colors.
