CHAPTER 8

<H2>

Creating Java <BR>
Applets

</H2>

<P><B>I</B>n the previous chapters you learned a sufficient number of 
elements of the Java language to write stand-alone applications. 
You can also use Java to write applications that run from within
a Web browser such as Nescape's Navigator or Microsoft's
Internet Explorer. These special applications are called Java applets.
</P>

<P>In this chapter you will learn about the basic structure of Java
applets and how to write Java applets. As part of learning to write Java
applets, you will also learn how to create a simple HTML file to run the applet
and how to pass parameters to Java applets.

Understanding Applets
</A></H3>

<P>Java applets are run from inside a Web browser as opposed to running as a
stand-alone programs. Alternatively, you can run the applet for debugging and testing
purposes from within the Applet Viewer program. Both the Web browser and the Applet
Viewer are GUI (Graphical User Interface) programs. To display or paint data within the
display of these programs, the applet must use Java classes specifically designed for
displaying information in a GUI environment. The Java GUI classes are contained in the
package java.awt. The AWT classes are an Alternative Windowing Toolkit library of classes
that provide the graphic elements (also called
<I>widgets</I>) for writing GUI-enabled
applications. To write sophisticated applets, you have to familiarize yourself with the classes in
the AWT library.
</P>

<P>The applet is a subclass of the class Panel in package
java.awt; that is, the class java.awt.Panel. To facilitate the creation of applets, a collection of methods and constructors have
been created in the class Applet in the package
java.applet. Figure 8.1 shows the hierarchy
diagram for the Applet class.

Features of Applets
</A></H4>

<P>Applets were originally created for hand-held devices such as PDAs (Personal
Digital Assistants). They were designed to run in an embedded environment; for example,
an environment embedded within the hardware or software of the PDAs. This property
of running applets in embedded environments has made it possible to adapt applets to
run within the environment of a Web browser, and therefore the environment of the Internet.
</P>

<P>The applet code is generally small (around a few kilobytes), and it can be
downloaded relatively quickly through the Internet to run inside a Web browser (see fig. 8.2).
The Web browser is Java-enabled and contains the Java runtime environment to execute
the applet code. The location of the applet code is embedded in an HTML
(HyperText Markup Language) file or document. HTML documents contain instructions that
the Web browsers interpret to render the HTML document graphically inside the display
of the Web browser.

<I>Running applets.</I>
</P>


<P>The applets can enhance the rendering of HTML documents in the Web browser by
the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Providing animation
<LI>          Accepting interactive input from the user
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-276"><P>Page 276</P></A>



<UL>
<LI>          Displaying sound (audio clips) with animated images
<LI>          Providing graphical elements such as scrolling bars, text area, buttons,
and so on
</UL>

<P>The applets can take advantage of built-in features of the Web browser. Applets,
for example, can use the Web browser's decoder programs for image files, such as GIF
and JPEG files. By using the Web browser's methods to decode the images, the applet
code is insulated against changes in the graphic image format.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch08_ 4">
Security Concerns for Applets
</A></H4>

<P>Because applets are executed from within another program, such as a Web browser,
they are not full-featured applications. Applets rely on the Web browser to perform a
number of functions, such as the decoding of images. In addition, because of security
concerns about downloading executable programs, such as applets from an untrusted
host, applets have limited file and network access.
</P>

<P>As seen in figure 8.2, applet code is downloaded from a host on the Internet, and
the precompiled byte code is executed within the Web browser running at the
user's workstation. The byte code interpreter is hardware-platform and
operating-system specific, but the byte code itself is platform independent. This means that the byte
code does not have to change to accommodate the different hardware and operating
specific platforms on the Internet.
</P>

<P>To further increase the security of the Java byte code, a verification process is
performed on the downloaded byte code before it can be run. As part of the verification,
all methods and variables referenced in the program are checked to see that they do
not violate any Java language conventions. Methods and variables, for example, in Java
are referenced by names. The verification process ensures that this is indeed so, and
that the program is not accessing memory areas that may contain other applications
or operating system code.
</P>

<P>Applets have limited access to the local file system of the workstation that they run
on. Currently, applets are not permitted to save files locally, or to read files on the local
disk. If applets were permitted to do this without any restrictions, a virus applet could
alter your files, or even read sensitive information from files on your local disk and
distribute them to unknown parties on the Internet. Applets cannot dynamically interact
with libraries written for other languages. They cannot, for example, load C/C++ libraries
in memory and dynamically link to them. Java has the capability to link class
methods statically with other language libraries by declaring the method to be native. Because
the code in other language libraries cannot be verified properly, native methods cannot
be used in writing applets.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-277"><P>Page 277</P></A>



<P>The Web browser may also place limitations on how an applet is run. The Web
browser is regarded by the user as a trusted application, as it has access to the local file
system. Applets that run in the browser are downloaded from untrusted hosts on the
network, and are untrusted applications. In fact, the Web user may not make an explicit choice
to run the applet; all that the user may have done is access a Web page, and the
HTML document for the Web page that contains a reference to an applet will cause the
applet to be automatically downloaded to the user's computer.
</P>

<P>Applets are also restricted to making network connections to the host from which
they are downloaded. They cannot establish new connections to other computers on
the network. If an applet were able to do so, it could send information to other computers
on the network and perform tasks such as impersonating a user by sending an e-mail
on behalf of the user.
</P>

Building Applets
</A></H3>

<P>Figure 8.1 shows the inheritance hierarchy of the class Applet. The Applet class
is inherited from the class Panel, which in turn is inherited from the class Container,
which in turn is inherited from the class Component, and which in turn (finally!) is
inherited from the class Object. Because of this long inheritance chain, the Applet class
acquires features that are a composite of its superclasses. To create a new applet, you
must extend the Applet class:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
      public class MyNewApplet extends java.applet.Applet
      {
         ...

      } // end MyNewApplet
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>As explained in Chapter 7, &quot;Object-Oriented Programming with Java,&quot; the use of
the reserved word public makes the class accessible from other packages. The
class MyNewApplet is the new applet that you are defining, and as part of the definition, you
are extending the class Applet defined in package
java.applet.
</P>

Understanding the Applet Class
</A></H4>

<P>To best understand how an applet is written, it is worthwhile to examine which
methods/variables are inherited by your new applet from the predefined class
Applet. The following example shows the methods that are available to your new applet class
from the superclass Applet:
