Object-Oriented <BR>
Programming with Java

</H2>

In the previous chapter you learned how to define and structure <BR>
classes. In this chapter you will learn to use an important tech-<BR>
nique of programming that is generally lumped into a category
called object-oriented programming.
</P>

<P>Java supports object-oriented programming by using an
inheritance mechanism that enables a class to extend another class. In this
chapter you will learn about superclasses and inheritance, and how
these mechanisms enable you to reuse logic in existing classes.

Inheritance in Java
</A></H3>

<P>This section will explain the basic properties of inheritance in relationship to the
Java language.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 3">
Understanding Inheritance Terminology
</A></H4>

<P>When a class E extends a class S, a relationship of the type shown in figure 7.1 is set
up between them. The class S is called the<I>
superclass</I>, and the class E is called the<I>
subclass</I> or <I>extended class</I>. Other terms that also have been used to describe this
relationship refer to S as the <I>parent class</I> and refer to E as the
<I>derived class,</I> or <I>child class</I>. Class E
is also said to <I>inherit</I> from class S.
</P>

<P>In the inheritance relationship shown in figure 7.1, class E, as well as being able
to access its own instance variables and methods, also can use the methods and
instance variables that class S has made available for just such a purpose.
</P>

Figure 7.1
Inheritance relationship.
</P>

<P>
In Java syntax, the relationship of figure 7.1 is described as the following:
</P>


<PRE>
class E extends S
{
      // Definition for class E

} // end E
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the use of the reserved word extends the definition of the superclass S.
</P>

<P>Consider the following skeleton structure for the two classes:
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-221"><P>Page 221</P></A>


<PRE>
class S
{
      // Declarations for instance variable sa, sb, sc.

      void s_method1()
      {
         ...
      } // end s_method1

      void s_method2()
      {
         ...

      } // end s_method2

      void s_method3()
      {
         ...

      } // end s_method3


} // end S


class E extends S
{
      // Declarations for instance variable ea, eb, ec.

      void e_method1()
      {
         ...
      } // end e_method1

      void e_method2()
      {
         ...

      } // end e_method2
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-222"><P>Page 222</P></A>


<PRE>

      void e_method3()
      {
         ...

      } // end e_method3


} // end E
</PRE>

<P>All the methods in E can use their class E's instance variables ea, eb, ec, and
methods e_method1(), e_method2, e_method3(). In addition, these classes can also use the
instance variables in class S, sa, sb, and sc. Additionally, the code in E can also use the
methods in S; that is, s_method1(), s_method2(), and
s_method3().
</P>

<P>The relationship between classes S and E is also shown in figure 7.2. The inherited
class E (subclass) is shown as encapsulating the class S, to indicate that the methods
and instance variables in S are available in class E.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch07_ 4">
Building a Derivation Chain
</A></H4>

<P>You can also define other classes that can inherit from class E, even though class
E inherits from another class S, as seen in the previous section. This type of
inheritance relationship is shown in figure 7.3. The diagram of figure 7.3 is also called a
<I>class hierarchy diagram</I>. Class hierarchies describe the relationship between Java
classes. Java's predefined classes use class hierarchy diagrams.
</P>

</P>


<P>Consider another class F inherited from the class E, as shown in the following example:
</P>

<PRE>
class F extends E
{
      // Declarations for instance variable fa, fb, fc.

      void f_method1()
      {
         &#133;
      } // end f_method1

      void f_method2()
      {
         &#133;
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-224"><P>Page 224</P></A>


<PRE>
      } // end f_method2

      void f_method3()
      {
         &#133;

      } // end f_method3


} // end F
</PRE>

<P>All the methods in class F can, of course, use their instance variables fa, fb, fc,
and methods f_method1(), f_method2, f_method3(). In addition, these classes can also use
the instance variables in class E, ea, eb, and ec; and also instance variables in E's
superclass sa, sb, and sc. Additionally, the code in F can also use the methods in class E and
the superclass S; that is, e_method1(),
e_method2(), e_method3(); and s_method1(),
s_method1(), and s_method3().
</P>

<P>The relationship between classes S, E, and F is also shown in figure 7.4. The
inherited class F is shown as encapsulating the class E, which is shown encapsulating S.
This indicates that the methods and instance variables in E and S are available in class F.

Understanding Inheritance Rules in Java
</A></H4>

<P>Listing 7.1 shows a program (file InheritRules.java on the CD-ROM that
accompanies this book) in which class E inherits from class S. Both classes, S and E, define
instance variables and instance methods. Figure 7.5 shows at a quick glance the method
and instance variables in the two classes.
