Getting Started with<BR>
Java

</H2>

<P>This chapter will discuss what a Java program is and how to
write a simple program. The goal of this chapter is to show a
quick overview of the basic elements of the language
without overwhelming you with the details and the power of the language.
After you understand the basic concepts of how a simple Java program
is written, you will have an easier time grasping some of the more
complex concepts covered in later chapters.
</P>

<P>This chapter does not assume that you are a professional programmer.
If you have had some prior background experience in programming such
as Basic, Pascal, Ada, or even C/C++, many of the programming
concepts in this chapter will be a review. This chapter, however, will introduce
to you some of the basic elements of the language.
</P>

<P>At the end of this chapter, you should be able to write some simple
but useful programs. To achieve this goal, this chapter will concentrate
on some of the Java program basics such as variables and constants,
control flow, and the basics of input and output. Some of the other
concepts such as object-oriented programming and design class structures
are important for writing larger programs. But these have been
deliberately left out in this chapter on getting started with Java.

<P>Although this approach will give you an understanding of how to write simple
Java programs, there are some disadvantages to this way of teaching. One disadvantage
is that you may be misled as to what you can accomplish with Java because you will not
be presented with the full power of Java. You should also be aware that some of
the examples have been contrived, because the full power of the Java language is
not presented here. Another disadvantage of this overview approach to programming
in Java is that later chapters will repeat some of these concepts, albeit in greater detail.
</P>

<P>There are several ways to compile your Java program, both free and
commercial. Throughout this book the examples will use the command line compiler supplied with
the Java Developers Kit (JDK). The examples will also be using the Java Virtual Machine
that comes with the JDK to run the Java programs. There are also commercial programs
for compiling Java such as Symantec's Visual Caf&eacute; and Microsoft's Visual J++.
</P>

Getting Started with Writing a <BR>
Simple Program
</A></H3>

<P>First, make sure that you have installed the JDK or your Java compiler as described
in the product documentation. In the section that follows, you will write the program
that will print out the following words:
</P>
<PRE>
Hello, world! I am a simple Java program!
</PRE>

<P>To be able to print this text with a Java program, you must learn the following elements:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          The basic structure of a Java program
<LI>          How system output is performed in the language
<LI>          How to create/edit this program
<LI>          How to compile the Java program
<LI>          How to run the Java program
</UL>

<P>In essence, these same steps will be used for even more complex and larger programs.
So after you understand how to perform these steps for a simple Java program, you
will have mastered larger Java programs as well.

Java Program
</A></H4>

<P>The following is an example of a simple Java program.
</P>

<PRE>
class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world! I am a simple Java program!&quot;);

    }
}
</PRE>

<P>To use this sample program, you must save the Java program in a text file. The name
of the file must end with a &quot;java&quot; extension. With the current release of the Java
language, you must save the program with the same name as the class name Hello-     Java.
The class name is the name that follows &quot;class&quot; in the preceding program and describes
the program fragment that is placed in the brackets {} as illustrated next:
</P>
<PRE>
class classname
{
      &#133;

}
</PRE>

<P>The name of the file, in the previous example, must be HelloWorld.java to match the
class name of HelloWorld. Class names in Java are case-sensitive. To compile and run
this program, you must change the class name to helloworld. In Java, because class
names are case-sensitive, the following class names are all distinct:
</P>
<PRE>
class HelloWorld
{
      &#133;
}

class helloworld
{
      &#133;
}
class helloWorld
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-14"><P>Page 14</P></A>



<PRE>
{
      &#133;
}
</PRE>

<P>Notice that because Java file names end with a four-letter &quot;java&quot; extension, you
cannot use an MS-DOS editor for creating these file names. MS-DOS file names are limited
to three characters.
</P>

<P>File names are also case-sensitive under UNIX. Under Windows NT and Windows
95, however, file names are not case-sensitive, even though the case is preserved
when creating file names. This means that if you try to create a file name, such
as helloWorld.java in a directory that already has a file named HelloWorld.java, you will
not be able to create a separate file name. In practical terms, this means that in the
Windows NT and Windows 95 environments, you must use class names that will not lead
to conflicts in unique file names if the Java programs are kept in the same directory.
</P>

<P>To create the Java text file, create a file called HelloWorld.java by using a text editor.
You can use any text editor that can work with long file names to create and save this file.
</P>

<P>The next step is to compile the test program. You can compile the program by using
the javac command line compiler. Bring up a command prompt window and change to
the directory in which you saved the HelloWorld.java file. Type &quot;javac
HelloWorld.java&quot; and you should see output similar to figure 2.1.

</P>


<P>To execute the compiled program, pass the class name as a parameter to the Java
Virtual Machine, java. Figure 2.2 shows the output of running the HelloWorld program from
the command line.
