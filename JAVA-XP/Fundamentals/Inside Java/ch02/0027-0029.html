<P>not part of the syntax.
</P>

<P>For Java basic types, the compiler automatically allocates space for variables of
that type. As mentioned earlier, class names can also be used to replace
type. If class names are used, the variables become the names of the object of that class type. The
Java compiler does not automatically create space for these class objects. Therefore,
unlike the case of Java basic types, class objects have to be instantiated using additional code.
</P>

<P>Notice that several variables can be defined by listing them on the same line. In
listing 2.1, a comment is placed next to each variable definition, further describing what
the variable represents. The variables that are used should be suggestive of the values
that they contain and their use.
</P>

<P>Variables that are defined by method are called
local variables, and exist only for the duration of the method invocation. When the method invocation returns to the
caller who called the method, the local variables &quot;disappear.&quot; They disappear in the sense
that you cannot access these variables from the caller program. These variables are
called local because they have a meaning only inside the method when that method is
being executed. When these variables are defined without the qualification of the
reserved word static, the space allocated for these variables is released when the method exits.
</P>

<P>If the qualifier static is used, the variable is allocated space at compile time; that
is, before the program is run and before the method is called. The space for a static
local variable is not released when the method exits. So a subsequent invocation of
the method can still reference the value that the variable was set to in a previous
invocation of the method. However, because the static variable is local to the method, only
the program code in the method can access this variable.
</P>

<P>Lines 19_22 of listing 2.1 are examples of assignment statements. Assignment
statements and declarations must terminate in a semicolon. You can place several
assignment statements on the same line. For example, lines 19_22 can also be written as the
following:
</P>
<PRE>lowest = _40; highest = 100; delta = 10;
</PRE>

<P>Generally speaking, such a placement of assignment statements is not
recommended because it makes such programs look dense and cluttered and a little harder to read.
</P>

<P>Also note that in listing 2.1, the variables are defined first and then the
assignment statements are used to set their values. Definitions can occur anywhere an
assignment statement occurs, although it is common to see definitions of variables grouped
together in the beginning, while statements, such as assignment statements that reference
them, occur later in the program. It is also possible to initialize a variable when defining
the variable. For example, you can define the variable
delta and initialize it by using the following statement:
</P>
<PRE>int delta = 10;
</PRE>

<P>You can then eliminate the statement on line 22 that sets the value of delta to 10.
</P>

<P>The main program logic is in lines 32_38, which describe a while loop that performs
the conversion of Centigrade values to their equivalent Fahrenheit values. The formula
that is used to provide this conversion is the following:
</P>

<P>F = <SUP>9</SUP>/<SUB>5</SUB>C +32
</P>

<P>C is the temperature in the Centigrade scale, and
F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.
</P>

Dissection of Program Code TempConvCF
</B></P>

<P>The following is a line-by-line dissection of the program in listing 2.1:
</P>

<P>Lines 1_7: This is the main comment preceding the program code. Notice that it uses
the /** */ form of the comment so that it can be reported in the document analysis tool.
</P>

<P>Lines 8_9, 42: This is the definition of the class. The name of the class is
TempConvCF. Therefore, the file name that contains this class should be named TempConvCF.java.
The body of the class is placed between the braces { } on lines 9 and 42.
</P>

<P>Lines 10_11,40: These lines contain the definition of the only method in this class.
This program is being developed as a Java application and not an applet. As such it
must contain the definition of function main(). As explained during the discussion of
the HelloWorld program earlier in the chapter, the function main must be qualified
with reserved words public, static, and void.
</P>

<P>Lines 12_17: These contain the variable definitions. The variable lowest and
highest define the low and high values of the centigrade values that will be converted.
The variable delta is the increment in temperature that is used for generating the
centigrade values between lowest and highest. A type of int is used to describe these
variables because an int is a 32-bit signed number and has a value ranging from
</P>

<P>_2147483648 to 2147483647. This is big enough for the values we have in mind and is
in fact an overkill for this example. Later on you will learn about other Java data basic
types that are smaller in size and that would be adequate for this example. These
variables fahrT and cenT are floating point variables that represent Fahrenheit and
Centigrade values.
Lines 19_22: These lines are the assignment statements, and are used to set the value
of the variables lowest, highest, and delta.
</P>

<P>Lines 24 and 25: These are used to print out the title of the Centigrade and
Fahrenheit columns. Notice the use of the \t character in the string that is displayed. This
generates a tab character. When you use the \ character, you are escaping the character value
that follows. This means that the character value that follows must be treated specially. In
the case of \t, the letter `t' that follows the backslash (\) indicates that the character
should be treated as a tab. Similarly, \n means the line feed character, \f means the form
feed character, and so on.

<P>Lines 27_31: The statement on line 31 is used to initialize the centT variable to the
lowest variable. Although the lowest is of type int, and centT is of type float, an
automatic conversion is done of the int value to a float value when this assignment is performed.
A float value is much larger than an int value so it can easily accommodate any type of
int value that may be assigned to a float variable.
</P>

<P>Lines 32, 33, 36, 38: The while loop repeatedly executes the body of statements within
its opening ({) and closing braces (}) until the condition specified in the while
statement evaluates to false. In this example it means that the statements between lines 32_38
will be repeatedly executed as long as the centT variable is less or equal to highest.
When the centT variable has a value that is greater than the highest variable, control will
be transferred to the statement after line 38. It is important that if you want the program
to exist, the while test condition centT &lt;= highest must evaluate to false. This is done
by ensuring that centT is incremented by a positive value delta on line 36 within the body
of the while loop.
</P>

<P>Line 34: This assignment statement performs the computation that converts
Centigrade value to the Fahrenheit value. Notice the use of the (float) immediately preceding
the expression on the right-hand side of the assignment statement. This syntax denotes
that the compiler must perform a type conversion. The result of an arithmetic
expression involving floating point value is always a double. A double is a floating point value
that has a larger precision than a float type. The compiler will generate an error message
if you assign a double floating point value to a variable defined as a float type
because this could result in a loss of precision if the double floating point value is very large.
So the use of the (float) before the arithmetic expression tells the compiler that it is safe
to perform the conversion to a float value. If the double value is indeed very large, a loss
of precision will occur, and you will get a truncated value assigned to the float variable.
</P>

<P>Line 35: This line prints out the Centigrade and the equivalent Fahrenheit values.
The System.out.println() function expects a string argument. The expression
centT+&quot;\t\t&quot;+fahrT is converted to a string. The &quot;+&quot; operator in this context represents string
concatenation and not arithmetic addition. Therefore, the value of centT and fahrT are converted
to string values by the compiler, and these are then concatenated with two tabs (&quot;\t\t&quot;)
in the middle to form a string value that is then passed to the
println() method. Note that the &quot;+&quot; operator is overloaded, in the sense that depending on the context, it can
mean arithmetic addition or string concatenation. Java, in general, does not permit
operator overloading. This example is one of the few instances where there is built-in
operator overloading defined.
