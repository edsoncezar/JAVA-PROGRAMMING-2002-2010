Introducing Variables and Simple <BR>
Arithmetic
</A></H3>

<P>Now that you know how to write a simple Java program, consider a program that
does something a little more interesting. In this section you will learn how simple
Java variables are defined and how they can be used in Java statements to build logic.
You will learn about the different ways to comment a program, how to assign values
to variables, and how to create simple types of loop statements. Later chapters will
cover these issues in greater detail.

Writing a Temperature Conversion<BR>
Program
</A></H4>

<P>As a first attempt, you will learn how to write a program that will print out a table
of Celsius temperatures and their equivalent Fahrenheit temperatures. The program
starts
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-23"><P>Page 23</P></A>

with a Celsius temperature of _40 degrees, the temperature at which the <BR>
Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales are equal, and continues to print out
the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent at intervals of 10 degrees until a temperature of
100 degrees Celsius is reached. Note that symbols +, *, and / when used in an
arithmetic expression have the usual meanings of addition, multiplication, and division that
are used in most programming languages.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Please note that the line numbers in listing 2.1 and other listings in this book are
shown for discussion purposes and are not part of the language syntax. If you plan on typing
in these programs, you should omit the line numbers. To run this program, you can
copy the file TempConvCF.java from the CD-ROM into a new directory and build the
project. The steps for performing this are outlined in detail for the JDK earlier in this
chapter.

Figure 2.8<BR>

</P>

<P>When the program is run, it produces the output shown in figure 2.8.
</P>

<P><B>
Overview of Program Code TempConvCF
</B></P>

<P>Among the first points you should notice in the program listing 2.1 is the liberal use
of
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-25"><P>Page 25</P></A>


<P>
comments. In Java, comments are used to document the program. Blank lines are used
to space the lines and to make the program more readable or improve its aesthetic
appeal. Indentations are used to indicate the nesting of statements.
</P>
<P>You will notice in listing 2.1 that three styles of comments exist. The program begins
with the comments of the following type:
</P>
<PRE>
/**
 * TempConvCF: Program to convert from Centigrade to
 * Fahrenheit.
 *
 * Author: Karanjit S. G. S. Siyan
 */
</PRE>

<P>Later on you also see a comment of the following type:
</P>

<PRE>/* Print title */
</PRE>

<P>From a language syntax point of view, these two comment types are nearly identical
in the sense that they both comment out the enclosing text. The first comment type is
used with an extra asterisk after the initial /*, whereas the second comment type does not
have the extra asterisk. Both comment types end with a closing */. Tools are
available, however, with many Java development kits that enable the extraction of comments
that begins with a /** and ends with a */. An example of this is the javadoc tool that
is available in JDK 1.1.
</P>

<P>If you have major sections of program logic that you would like to document and
be reported by the Java document analysis tool (javacdoc), you should enclose them with
a /** and */. Any other comment type such as the /* */ will not be reported by
the document analysis tool.
</P>

<P>Javadoc is a very powerful documentation tool that can be used to
automatically generate documentation for packages, classes, interfaces, exceptions, methods,
and variables. Documentation will only be generated for public and protected aspects
of objects in accordance with the basic object-oriented principle of encapsulation.
To prepare your objects for autogenerated documentation, surround your comments
with the /** */ comment delimiters. Many parameters may be used to create more
meaningful documentation, for more information about these refer to the online documentation.
</P>

<P>After you are ready to generate documentation for your object simply type
javadoc objectname. If, for example, you wanted to autogenerate documentation for the
java.net package you would type javadoc java.net.*.
</P>

<P>If you do not want to use autogenerated documentation you may want to avoid the
use of the /** */ and /* */ comment delimiters. A problem with the these delimiters is
that one may, during the process of editing the program text, accidentally delete the ending
*/, or place it in the wrong location. In this case, entire sections of programs may
get accidentally commented out. In many cases, this will cause syntax errors to be
generated,
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-26"><P>Page 26</P></A>


<P>
but this is not guaranteed and, in the worst case, the program may compile just fine,
but have missing functionality or incorrect logic.
</P>
<P>A safer form of comment would be to use the // characters to start the comment.
The end-of-line character on that line, or end of file, automatically terminates the comment
so that it is impossible to inadvertently leave the comment unterminated. In listing 2.1
you can see examples of this type of comment on lines 12_17 that describe the use
of program variables.
</P>

<P>Also, notice the use of comments on the closing brace (}) used to indicate the end
of syntax element of the program. The while statement on lines 32_38, for example, has
the form:
</P>

<PRE>while (centT &lt;= highest)
{
      &#133;

} // end while
</PRE>

<P>The // end while at the end of the closing brace (}) for the while loop is optional, and
is used by the author as a matter of style to visually and clearly indicate the end of
the statement. In a large program that is literally littered with hundreds of closing braces,
it can become difficult to figure out which closing brace ends which type of
statement, especially when the statements are heavily nested and span several pages of text.
You'll notice similar comments that end the main function definition and the class definition:
</P>
<PRE>     } // end main

 } // end TempConvCF
</PRE>

<P>Notice the use of blank lines in the program to group statements into logical units
for easier reading and comprehension of the program. Again, this is an issue of style,
and highly recommended by the author.
</P>

<P>Lines 12_17 of listing 2.1 define the variables that must be used. A variable must be
defined before it can be used. The general syntax of defining a variable is the following:
</P>
<PRE>type var1{, varN ;
</PRE>

<P>The type is one of the Java basic types or a class name defined in the program. In
listing 2.1, you can see examples of the basic types such as int and float. The int type represents
a range of integers, and float represents floating point values. Besides these basic
types, Java defines other basic types such as byte, short, long, double, and char.
</P>

<P>The var1, varN are one or more variables that can follow the type name. The
declaration of variables ends with a semicolon. The notation
{,varN } means zero or more occurrences of whatever is inside the braces. The braces are used as
meta-characters and are
