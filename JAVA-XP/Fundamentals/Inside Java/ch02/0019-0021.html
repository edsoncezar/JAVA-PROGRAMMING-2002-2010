<P>element of the array is of type Strings. The first element of args, for example, could be the string
&quot;To&quot; and the second element could be &quot;be.&quot; Figure 2.6 shows an example of an array
of strings that could be passed to the main method.
</P>

<P>There is nothing special about the name args used in the main method. You can replace
it with another valid variable name, such as the one shown in the following example:
</P>


<PRE>public static void main(String str v[])
{
     Rest of program code for main
}
</PRE>

<P>If your code in the body of the main program needs to reference the argument passed
to main, you must ensure that you use the new name str_v instead of the name args.
You will find, however, that as a convention, most Java code uses the name args as
the argument for the main program.
</P>

<P>Who supplies the array of strings that are passed to the method main? The Java
runtime environment passes the string data specified on the command line when the
HelloWorld Java program is invoked as an array of strings. Consider, for example, the
following invocation of the Java program:
</P>
<PRE>&gt; jview HelloWorld To be or not to be!
</PRE>

<P>In this case, the method main will pass the following array of strings:
</P>
<PRE>&quot;To&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;be!&quot;
</PRE>

<P>In the body of the main method (that is, code included in the braces {}), no
further reference is made to args in the simple example of the HelloWorld program, which
was discussed earlier. You must still, however, specify the args parameter as an array
of strings, even though your program may not actually use the string.
</P>

<P>The main method is preceded with a number of modifiers such as public, static, and
void. As mentioned previously, these modifiers are reserved words in the Java language
and cannot be used as variable names.
</P>

<P>The modifier public before a method name makes the method &quot;callable&quot; to Java
code outside the class. In the HelloWord example, there is no other Java code outside
the class HelloWorld, but the caller, in this case, is the Java runtime environment. The
Java runtime environment contains the Java Virtual Machine that processes the Java
byte code and the Java runtime library code needed for running a Java program. The use
of the reserved word public before a method name makes the method publicly available
or callable to any &quot;user&quot; or &quot;client&quot; of the class. The &quot;user&quot; or &quot;client,&quot; in this case, is not
a human person; it actually refers to any other program code that is defined outside
the class.
</P>

<P>The class defines the object; however, it does not create the actual object. A
created object occupies space in computer memory. The class only defines a template for
the
</P>

<P>
object. To create the actual object, you must use the class name to create the object.
The following is an example of creating an object from the class HelloWord:
</P>

<PRE>HelloWorld     hwobj;
</PRE>

<P>The preceding statement creates the object hwobj from the class (or template)
definition HelloWorld. This process of creating an object from a class definition is called
creating an instance of the object or
instantiating a class. After you have created a real
object, you can invoke the public methods (methods such as main that have a public
modifier) by using a notation such as the following:
</P>
<PRE>hwobj.main(&quot;To&quot;, &quot;be&quot; &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;be!&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>The preceding example shows how a method in a class is invoked. The general syntax
of invoking a method is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>objectname.methodname(arguments);
</PRE>

<P>The objectname refers to the name of the object, such as hwobj;
methodname refers to the name of the method, such as main; and
arguments refers to the list of arguments passed to the method.
</P>

<P>In general, one must create an instance of the object before invoking its method.
The method is then associated with data inside the object. Creating an object from a
description of the object is called instantiating the object. The class definition of an object is
the description of the object.
</P>

<P>Sometimes you would like to call a method, such as main, without first creating
an instance of the class HelloWorld. You can do this by using the modifier static in
defining the method. In the example of the main method defined in class HelloWorld, the
modifier static is used to indicate that the main method can be invoked without defining
an instance of the class such as hwobj. Assuming the example of the arguments passed
in figure 2.6, the Java runtime environment is able to invoke main by using the equivalent
of the following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>HelloWorld.main(&quot;To&quot;, &quot;be&quot; &quot;or&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;be!&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>Notice that HelloWorld is the name of the class and not the name of an
instantiated object. It is possible to call main() in this manner because a method defined with
a reserved word static is associated with all instances of the object of a class, and can
be invoked by using the following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>classname.methodname(arguments);
</PRE>

<P>The classname refers to the name of the class;
methodname refers to the name of the method, and
arguments refers to the list of arguments passed to the method.

<P>The final modifier that is used with the definition for main is void. In Java all methods
are expected to return a value. Many situations arise, however, when a method performs
a piece of logic but does not need to return anything. In these cases, you must use
the modifier void before the method name, thereby indicating that no value is expected to
be returned by the method.
</P>

Printing Output and Program Summary
</B></P>

<P>So far you have learned all aspects of the HelloWorld class except the single
code statement in the main method:
</P>
<PRE>System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world! I am a simple Java program!&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>The preceding statement invokes the println method defined in the built-in System
class. The println method prints the string to the standard output device, which is usually
the computer monitor. After printing the string, the println method outputs the
new-line character, which causes the cursor to be positioned on the next line on the
computer screen.
</P>

<P>Notice that to use the method println, there was no instance of the System class
defined in the class HelloWorld. This is because all methods in the System class are static
and can be invoked by specifying the class name alone.
</P>

<P>Figure 2.7 shows a summary of the program elements of a simple Java program, such
as the HelloWord class described in this section. This summary is by no means a
complete outline of a Java program.
