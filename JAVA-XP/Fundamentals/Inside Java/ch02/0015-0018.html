Understanding the Structure of a Java Program
</A></H4>

<P>The HelloWorld Java program illustrates the basic structure of a Java program.
</P>
<PRE>class HelloWorld
{
     public static void main(String args[])
     {
          System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world! I am a simple Java program!&quot;)

     }
     }
</PRE>

<P>The following sections describe the structure and meaning of this simple Java
program. Interestingly enough, to explain this simple Java class, you need to understand
several programming language concepts and the concept of objects in Java.
</P>

<P><B>
The Class Structure
</B></P>

<P>Notice that the program code for the HelloWorld program is embedded in the
following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>class classname
{
     Rest of program code
}
</PRE>

<P>In Java, a class is used to define a piece of program code. It begins with the reserved
word class followed by the name of the class
(classname) and then by the brace characters {}.
The program code is placed in the brace characters {} that follow the class statement. In Java,
the brace characters {} and the program code inside them are called a program
block.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-16"><P>Page 16</P></A>



<P>A reserved word, such as class, has a special meaning in the Java language and
cannot be used for programmer-defined data variables and functions. Other reserved words
in the HelloWorld Java example are public, static, and void.
</P>

<P>All Java programs containing program code must have at least one class. Within
this class is the actual data and program code that operates on the data. The class
mechanism is used in Java to describe the notion of an
object.
</P>

<P><B>
Simple Java Objects
</B></P>

<P>An object is a collection of data and programs that operate upon that data. Figure
2.3 shows a conceptual representation of an object. In this figure, the data is shown in
the central core of the object. Surrounding the data, in this figure, are programs that
operate upon the data. Programs defined within an object that operate upon the data in
the object are called methods. In other object-oriented languages such as
Small Talk, a language developed at Xerox Palo Alto Research, the methods are also called
messages, and therefore some of the Java documentation refers to the programs that operate
on data within an object as messages.

Figure 2.3<BR>
Conceptual representation of an object.
</P>

<P>Causing the program in the object to be run is called
invoking a method, calling a method, or sending a message
to the object. Conceptually, the idea is that when a method
is invoked for the object, or when a message is sent to the object, the program code alters
the state of the object that is represented by data in the object (see fig. 2.4).
</P>

<P>It is not always necessary for a method to modify the data in an object; the method
could simply return the current values of the data in the object, or perform some other logic.
A method in a Java class corresponds to the functions, procedures, or subroutines in
other programming languages such as C, Pascal,
Basic, Fortran, and so on. A major difference
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-17"><P>Page 17</P></A>



<P>is that a method in the Java language is always defined within a class or within
the syntax of a class, whereas a function, procedure, or subroutine does not have
this association with the object. A Java method has access to all data defined in the
class. Other methods outside the class do not automatically have access to the data in
the class, unless explicitly granted such access (see fig. 2.5). You will learn more
about methods and classes in later chapters in this book. At this point, only the basic
meaning of a Java class is sufficient for understanding simple Java programs being introduced.

<P>a trivialized form of a Java object. HelloWorld class contains no data, and the
class contains only one method called &quot;main.&quot;
</P>

<P><B>
The Definition of the main Program Method
</B></P>

<P>When a Java application is run, control is transferred to the method called
&quot;main.&quot; Normally, you can assign any name to the methods in a class, but the name &quot;main&quot;
is special, because it is the name reserved for the method to which initial program control
is transferred when a Java program is run. The method main is defined as follows:
</P>

<PRE>public static void main(String args[])
{
     Rest of program code for main
}
</PRE>

<P>To communicate data with a method, you pass
arguments to the method. Arguments are also called
parameters. Arguments, or parameters, are placeholders that describe
the actual data that is passed to the method. Arguments follow the method name and
are enclosed in parentheses.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Arguments or parameters are used as placeholders for passing data to methods.
</BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<P>Immediately following the method name and arguments is a block of code enclosed
in braces {}. In the example of the main method there is only a single argument
definition inside the parentheses:
</P>
<PRE>String args[]
</PRE>

<P>The String refers to a built-in class defined in the Java language that is used to
contain string data. The Java language defines several useful built-in classes for types of
data and functions that are used frequently in many Java programs. In this case, the
String built-in class is particularly useful for describing string data. String data is a sequence
of characters and is typically used to describe text data, such as messages. String data
is represented as a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. You can see an example
of string data in the class HelloWorld:
</P>
<PRE>&quot;Hello, world! I am a simple Java program!&quot;
</PRE>

<P>The use of args immediately following Strings defines the name of the placeholder for
the type of data to be passed to the method. The brackets [] following the args define
the argument args to be a reference to an array. Therefore, the argument args that are to
be passed are an array of Strings. You will learn more about arrays later on, but for
now consider an array as an ordered list of elements&#151;in the case of args, each
