</PRE>

<P>The server first tries to invoke the servlet with the name provided in the name field.
If this fails or if no name is provided, the server attempts to load the servlet based on
the code and codebase fields. Any remaining attribute fields within the &lt;servlet&gt; tag
are passed as initialization parameters to the servlet. If the server loads the servlet and
a name was specified, the server keeps the servlet loaded so that the next time the
servlet is accessed it is not reloaded. If no name is specified, the server reloads the servlet
each time it is accessed.
</P>

<P>After the servlet is ready to execute, the server calls the
service() method of the servlet. The name/value pairs specified in the HTML file with the &lt;param&gt; tag are accessible
to the servlet by using the standard
getParameter() and getParameters() methods on the ServletRequest object passed to the servlet in the
service() method. Everything the servlet writes to
ServletResponse.getOutputStream() is also written to the client as part of the
client's requested document.
</P>

<P><B>Error Response Servlet</B>
</P>

<P>When you call HttpServletResponse's sendError()
method with only a status code to return an error to the requester, the ErrorServlet is actually invoked to create and send the
error reply. The built-in ErrorServlet returns either a simple error reply message generated
by translating the status number into a standard error text string, or it returns the
contents of a file from the preconfigured error page directory (the error.directory servlet
init() parameter). The files in the error directory are named by adding the .HTML extension
to the status code; for example, the message for &quot;not found&quot; (code 404) is contained in
the file 404.html.
</P>

<P>By implementing the creation and transmission of error response pages as a servlet,
Java Web Server provides great flexibility in handling error responses. You can easily
replace the built-in servlet with your own customized error response servlet.
</P>

<P><B>InvokerServlet</B>
</P>

<P>The InvokerServlet processes HTTP requests to explicitly invoke a servlet instead
of implicitly invoking a servlet as a result of path translation. In the default server
configuration, the InvokerServlet is triggered by a /servlet in the requested URL. The rest of
the URL characters occurring after /servlet are presumed to identify the name of the
servlet to be executed.
</P>

<P><B>ImagemapServlet</B>
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-856"><P>Page 856</P></A>



<P>The ImagemapServlet handles the server-side processing of image maps that
are specified by using an extension of standard NCSA map files. A server-side image map
is specified in an HTML file by placing
&lt;IMG&gt; inside the &lt;A HREF=&#133;&gt; tag instead of
text description of the link. The following HTML, for example, is used to place an image
map in a document:
</P>

<PRE>
&lt;A 
HREF=&quot;http://&lt;server-host-name&gt;/imagemap/&lt;map-file-name&gt;&quot;&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;&lt;image-file&gt;&quot; ISMAP&gt;
&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Image map files can reside anywhere HTML documents are permitted to reside.
The ImagemapServlet supports image map files that are in standard NCSA format, with
some extensions to provide better support for text-only browsers.
</P>

<P><B>CGIServlet</B>
</P>

<P>To enable backward compatibility with existing CGI programs, Java Web Server has
a built-in servlet, CGIServlet, that functions as a bridge between the Servlet API and
CGI. The translation of servlet requests to CGI is feasible because all the necessary
information is available through the Servlet API.
</P>

<P><B>AdminServlet</B>
</P>

<P>Online server administration is performed by AdminServlet. By using this servlet,
the administrator can perform all the server's configuration functions without ever having
to manually edit configuration files. Also, the use of an administration servlet ensures
that changes to multiple configuration files are correctly completed.
</P>

<P>The following is a partial list of the functions performed with the AdminServlet:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Restart or shut down the server.
<LI>          Change operating parameters, such as the server port.
<LI>          Vary parameters that affect server performance, such as timeouts and file
cache size.
<LI>          Control event logging.
<LI>          Specify file and servlet name aliases.
<LI>          Control virtual host properties.
<LI>          Configure proxy operation.
<LI>          Set up user and group access control information.
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-857"><P>Page 857</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>          Administer access control lists and specify the resource to which they apply.
<LI>          Identify the servlets loaded at server startup.
</UL>

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter has introduced servlets and explained their functionality as well as
the Servlet API. The basics of the Java Web Server were also explained. The Servlet API
and the Java Web Server covered in this chapter are only beginning steps toward defining
a radically new architecture in server software. Taken to its logical conclusion, servlets
can evolve into the server-side equivalent of application components, and the Servlet
API can become the future of server software component architecture&#151;a Java Beans for
the server. This new architecture goes beyond simply replacing CGI programs&#151;it
completely changes server implementations. The Java Web Server shows how an
HTTP server can be remolded to use servlets to significantly increase flexibility
and customization. As the servlet technology matures, more standard servlets will
be defined, such as standard servlet bridges to databases; and new server-side
technologies, such as JDBC, will be first introduced as servlets.
