Servlets and the Java<BR>
Web Server<BR>

</H2>


<P><b>T</b>his chapter covers servlets, the newest aspect of Java network
ing. Servlets are the server-side equivalents of applets&#151;Java
 programs designed to execute in an environment provided by
a Web server. Originally intended as a Java-style replacement for
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, servlets are supported as an
extension package to JDK 1.1 and use a Java-based HTTP server that
implements the newly defined Servlet API. Like applets, servlets can be
automatically downloaded to the server, and untrusted servlets run in a
secured environment. Unlike applets, servlets have no graphical user
interface and do not use the AWT classes; all user interaction is by way of
the browser. In this chapter, you are also introduced to the basic features
of the Java Web Server and learn how to construct your own servlets
with the Servlet API.

Because the Java Web Server is being released after JDK 1.1, this chapter covers
the Servlet API at the time of the JDK 1.1 release&#151;concentrating on the essentials
of Servlet programs and the features expected in the final product. Because the
examples are based on the Servlet API alpha 2 release, some examples may need minor
corrections to work with the final product release. The latest information on the Servlet API and
the Java Web Server can be found at

Introducing Servlets
</A></H3>

<P>The obvious question since the introduction of Java and the HotJava browser, with
its client-side applets, has been, &quot;What can Java do for the server-side?&quot; Java
applets facilitate the addition of specialized functions, such as intelligent forms, to a Web
page; with servlets, developers may add custom Java processing functions to the server
with the new Servlet API definitions, which extend Web server functionality. Servlets are
just the beginning of a standard way to develop object-oriented, portable, strongly
typed Web applications that can be used in any server supporting this API.
</P>

<P>The following section explains servlets in relation to applets, and explains the purpose
of the Servlet API. It also presents an overview of the uses of servlets.

Comparing Servlets and Applets
</A></H4>

<P>Before going into detail about servlets and the new Servlet API, it's important
to understand the differences between servlets and applets. Servlets and applets
are compared in table 18.1.

Servlet API Goals
</A></H4>

<P>The Servlet API is the standard Java interface between Web servers and
HTTP-processing programs. Servlets execute in a special environment provided by a Web server
that supports the new Servlet API. This environment supplies all the resources servlets
need to run, and a security model to maintain system integrity. This approach is similar to
the controlled execution environment provided by Web browsers for applets. The
Servlet API has the following attributes:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Ease of use and understanding. The Servlet API provides the same HTTP
information as is available through CGI variables, simplifying the conversion of
existing CGI programs to servlets.
<LI>          High performance. The Servlet API eliminates the overhead of starting an
external CGI program to serve each request; it enables servlets to perform practically
all server operations, including basic file serving.
<LI>          Platform independence. Like applets, servlets run on any server platform
that provides a Java Virtual Machine supporting the Servlet API.
<LI>          Transport independence. The Servlet API has base classes that are independent
of the transport protocol used to carry Web content and subclasses that are
specific to HTTP. Specific versions of the Servlet API can be developed for future
Web transport protocols.
<LI>          Secure and safe. Untrusted servlets run in a secured environment, as described
in the &quot;Untrusted Servlet Security Sandbox&quot; section later in the chapter,
which protects access to the network and other local resources. Trusted servlets have
full access to local resources.
</UL>

<P>Java's Servlet API has a significant advantage over CGI in terms of
performance, transport independence, and security. The differences between servlets and
CGI programs are highlighted in table 18.2.

What You Can Do with Servlets
</A></H4>

<P>Servlets have all the power and flexibility of Java programs; any Java function
or package that does not use the AWT (remember there is no graphical user interface)
can be used. Trusted servlets, for example, have full access to read and write files. You
can use the JDK 1.1 internationalization package to construct localized HTML
dynamic content, the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) package to access databases, and
a Remote Method Invocation (RMI) or Common Object Request Broker
Architecture (CORBA) package to get information from other machines. The only restriction
on servlets' use of Java packages is that the package must support multithreading or
be thread-safe; otherwise the servlet must provide thread safety as described in
the &quot;Writing Servlets&quot; section of this chapter.
</P>

<P>Because the Servlet API is specified in Java, instead of a procedure language, as
done by other server extension interfaces, you get the benefits of object-oriented
development in building your server extensions. As an example of the power and flexibility of
servlets, the Java Web Server uses servlets to handle file requests, manage file caches,
and construct error response pages. All HTTP processing is handled by a different
core servlet shipped with the product, depending on the operation performed or
information requested. The use of servlets for all Web server operations makes a very flexible
Web platform. Server administrators, for instance, can easily subclass the file serving
servlet to collect statistics on files requested and track user information, or administrators
can subclass the error response servlet to return specialized error messages.
