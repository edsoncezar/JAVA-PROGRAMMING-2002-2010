<P>Line 94 uses the instantiate() method of the java.beans.Beans class to make an instance
of the Scope Bean from the Scope.ser file. The first parameter is the class

loader, and the second is the name of the serialized object file, in this case Scope.ser. This is the
same mechanism that a builder tool uses to load the state of a Bean.

Using the Jar Tool to Package the Scope Bean
</B></P>

<P>The steps for packaging a bean in a JAR file are as follows:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>          Create a file that supplies additional information to the manifest file.
<BR>
<BR>          The additional information to be supplied is that the Scope.class file is a Java
Bean. We'll arbitrarily name this file manifest.tmp, which contains the following lines:

<PRE>
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Name: chapter15/code/scopejar/Scope.class
Java-Bean: True
</PRE>

<LI>          Run the jar tool to create the JAR file.
<BR>
<BR>          Assuming that the default directory is at the base of the
chapter15/code/scopejar path, and that the Scope.class and Scope.ser files are the only files in the
chapter15/code/scopejar directory, execute the following command:
<BR>

<PRE>
jar cfm scope.jar manifest.tmp chapter15/code/scopejar/*
</PRE>

<BR>          This creates a JAR file named scope.jar by using manifest information
from manifest.tmp and containing the files in the chapter15/code/scopejar directory.
</OL>

<P>
This JAR file can now be used directly by a builder tool, or the files can be extracted and

used by an application similar to the way that ScopeJar does.

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter focused on the new Java component architecture known as Java Beans.
It defined Java Beans and discussed the most important features: properties, events,
and methods. Several examples demonstrated how you can build your own Beans and
emit the desired events. Advanced topics, such as bound properties and introspection,
were covered as well.
</P>

<P>
The next chapter covers the design goals and capabilities of Java Remote
Method Invocation (RMI) and how to develop Java programs that use RMI. This chapter
also discusses Object Serialization, how serialization enables RMI, and how
serialization enables persistent Java objects.
