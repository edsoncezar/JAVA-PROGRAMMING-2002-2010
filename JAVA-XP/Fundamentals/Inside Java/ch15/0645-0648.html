Java Beans: Java's <BR>
Component Architecture

</H2>

<P><B>T</B>his chapter focuses on the new Java component architecture 
known as Java Beans. The following sections define Java
Beans, discuss its associated properties, methods, and
events, and provides examples of Beans and their usage. Many new JDK
1.1 features were added primarily for the sake of supporting Java Beans;
this chapter mentions some of these features, such as introspection,
serialization, and JAR files, that haven't been covered in previous chapters.

Understanding Java Beans
</A></H3>

<P>Java Beans is JavaSoft's name for the Java component architecture. In this context,
a component is a reusable software-building block (or &quot;Bean&quot; to perpetuate the
coffee metaphor). The purpose of a component architecture is to enable the building of
applications by assembling preexisting components.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch15_ 3">
Java Beans Defined
</A></H4>

<P>According to JavaSoft, &quot;A Java Bean is a reusable software component that can
be manipulated visually in a builder tool.&quot;
</P>

<P>In this definition, a builder tool is typically an integrated application
development environment, but other possibilities do exist. A builder tool, for example, could be a
Web page authoring tool, where Beans could be dragged and dropped onto a page.
Another builder tool is the beanbox test container, which is included in the BDK (Beans
Development Kit) that JavaSoft has made available for developers to test their Java Beans.

BDK 1.1 beta 2 was used to test and display the example Beans in this chapter.
To download the BDK, access the following Web page and follow the
download instructions.

Instructions on how to use the BDK, as well as lots of Java Beans documentation
are included as a part of the BDK.

</P>
<P>In JavaSoft's definition of Java Beans, &quot;manipulated visually&quot; means that the
developer can change the Bean's appearance and behavior by using the builder tool's
graphical user interface.
</P>

<P>
Five attributes are common to Java Beans:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Properties: A Bean has properties that can be manipulated from both a
program and a builder tool.
<LI>          Customization: Some Beans have properties whose type is unknown to a
builder tool. In this case, the builder tool has no standard way of enabling the
developer to visually edit the property. When this happens, the Bean should provide its
own <I>property editor.</I> Also, some Beans are too complex to be edited by the
builder tool's default mechanisms. In this case, the Bean should provide its
own <I>customizer</I> with which the developer can visually edit the Bean's
properties. Property editors will be covered later in this chapter.
</UL>
	
<A NAME="PAGENUM-647"><P>Page 647</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>          Persistence: Beans often are distributed in a serialized form, which means that
a builder tool or application can load the Bean and restore the state of its
properties. A Bean must, therefore, be serializable. Serialization is covered in more
	detail in Chapter 16, &quot;Remote Method Invocation and Object Serialization.&quot;
<LI>          Events: A Bean typically emits and/or receives events. Beans use the
Delegation Event Model, which is discussed in Chapter 14, &quot;The New, Improved
AWT: Menus, Events, and More New Features.&quot;
<LI>          Introspection: A Bean is constructed in a such manner that a builder tool can
find out about such elements as a Bean's properties and events. Introspection will
be covered later in this chapter.
</UL>

<P>
It is important to understand that Beans can execute in two environments:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          The design environment:<I> </I>This is often a builder tool, as described previously.
In the <I>design environment,</I> the Bean must supply information about itself.
This information is often contained in classes that are separate from the classes
that define the Bean's runtime behavior.
<LI>          The runtime environment: This is any application in which the Bean is
used, including applications developed in a scripting language. No need exists to
supply the extra information to the typical application in which a Bean runs, so only
the classes that define a Bean's runtime behavior are needed.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="ch15_ 4">
Reasons for Beans
</A></H4>

<P>The software industry has always championed the concept of reuse. Over the years,
the scope, or granularity, of reuse has increased, which has produced an
accompanying increase in productivity. Four levels of granularity exist:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Since programming began, sections of source code were made available to,
and reused by, other developers.
<LI>          When structured programming came in vogue in the 1970s, function libraries
were shared.
<LI>          As object-oriented programming matured in the 1980s, class libraries were
shared by developers and sold by third parties.
<LI>          As GUI development has exploded in the 1990s, third-party components
have become instrumental in enabling developers to build reliable applications
quickly. VBX and OCX components, for example, have become popular tools for
building Visual Basic applications.
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-648"><P>Page 648</P></A>




<P>Java Beans belong to the last level of reuse granularity. An increasing number of
Java Beans are becoming available from software component developers. Integrated
Java development environments typically come with several Beans that developers can use.
</P>

<P>Some of the more popular Beans are those that function as higher-level GUI
widgets, such as multicolumn list boxes and toolbar managers. Beans also can be small
applications, such as a drawing program, that can be embedded in a compound
document. Beans also can be non-visual software components: A timer widget, for example, emits
a &quot;tick&quot; event at a predetermined interval.
</P>

<P>Now that you have an idea of Beans and their uses, consider the following example of
a simple Bean.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch15_ 5">
An Example Bean: Scope
</A></H4>

<P>Listing 15.1 depicts a Java class named Scope, which serves as a simple example of
a Java Bean. The Scope Bean is similar to an electronic scope in that it contains
graduated marks in the horizontal and vertical axes. When the user moves the mouse cursor
over the Bean, crosshairs appear whose intersection occurs at the hotspot of the
cursor. Listing 15.2, later in this chapter, displays the Bean in an application window. Figure
15.2 shows the application's display, which is essentially the Scope Bean filling up the
entire application window.
