<P>Boolean values can also result from the evaluation of a relational operator. In Java,
the relational operators are equals to (==), less
than (&lt;), greater than (&gt;), less than or equal
to (&lt;=), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), and not equal
to (!=).
</P>

<P>Using the examples of Boolean variables defined previously, consider the
following statements:
</P>

<PRE>
bval1 = x == y;
bval1 = x &lt; y;
bval1 = x &gt; y;
bval1 = x != y;
bval1 = x*3 == y;
</PRE>

<P>The first assignment statement is comparing x with y to see if they are equal.
Clearly, they are not, because x is 3 and y is 9. Therefore, bval1 is set to the value of
false. Similarly, the values of bval1 in the second, third, and fourth assignment statements
are true, false, and true respectively. In the last assignment statement, the
arithmetic expression x*3 is compared with y. Because these expressions each evaluate to 9,
they are equal, and bval1 is set to true.
</P>

<P>When a Boolean expression is evaluated, the expression is evaluated only until its
value can be determined. Any remaining part of the expression that does not
contribute to the
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-59"><P>Page 59</P></A>



<P>evaluation of the expression is ignored. This type of evaluation is called the
short-circuit evaluation and can result in an efficient evaluation of the code.
</P>

<P>Consider the following example:
</P>

<PRE>
int            x1 = 10;
int            x2 = 20;
int            x3 = 30;
boolean     b1, b2;
b1 = x1 &gt; 9 || x2 &lt; 25;
b2 = x2 &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; x3 &gt; 10;
b3 = x2 &lt; 25 &amp;&amp; x3 &gt; 10;
</PRE>

<P>In the first assignment statement, the expression x1 &gt; 9 evaluates to true. Because
the Boolean OR is used, regardless of the value the second expression x2 &lt; 25 evaluates
to, the result will be true. Therefore, the second expression is not evaluated, and b1 is set
to true.
</P>

<P>In the second assignment statement, the expression x2 &lt; 10 evaluates to false.
Because the Boolean AND is used, regardless of the value the second expression x3 &gt; 10
evaluates to, the result will be false. Therefore, the second expression is not evaluated, and
b2 is set to false.
</P>

<P>In the third assignment statement, the expression x2 &lt; 25 evaluates to true. Because
the Boolean AND is used, you cannot at this point determine the overall value of
the expression. In fact, the overall value will depend on the second expression x3 &gt; 10,
which must be evaluated. This evaluates to a true, therefore, b2 is set to true.
</P>

<P>Notice that in the first and second assignment statements, the short circuit
evaluation method could be used by discarding the evaluation of the remaining expression. In
the third assignment statement, however, the complete expression had to be evaluated.
</P>

<P>Listing 3.4 shows a Java program that illustrates the behavior of Boolean expressions.

<P>Consider the Example 1 on lines 22_24 in listing 3.4. In line 23 the expression
x1*2 evaluates to 200, and x2 has a value of 200. Because the test is one of inequality,
b1 evaluates to true.
</P>

<PRE>
// Example 1
b1 = x1*2 == x2;
System.out.println(&quot;b1 = &quot;+b1);
</PRE>

<P>Consider the Example 2 on lines 26_28 in listing 3.4. In line 27 the expression
x1+x2 evaluates to 300, and 3*x1 evaluates to 300. Because the test is one of inequality,
b2 evaluates to false.
</P>

<PRE>
// Example 2
b2 = x1+x2 != 3*x1;
System.out.println(&quot;b2 = &quot;+b2);
</PRE>

<P>Consider the Example 3 on lines 31_33 in listing 3.4. In line 32 the expression (x3_2*x2
&lt; 0) is evaluated first. Because x3 _2*x2 is _100, this expression evaluates to true. This
is where the short-circuit behavior of Boolean expression evaluation is seen. The
overall expression is going to be true, regardless of the value of the second expression (x3 =
400) &lt; 2*x2. Therefore, the second expression is not evaluated, and the overall expression
is true. Another interesting item to note in the second expression is the use of the
assignment operator (=) in x3 = 400. x3 is assigned a value of 400, and this is compared to
2*x2. Because the second expression evaluation is skipped, the value of x3 is never set to
400 as it may first appear on examining the expression.
