In particular, note that the Inf value is reported as a number followed by INF, and the
NaN

<P>As expected, all the standard arithmetic operators such as *, +, / work with floating
point numbers, in addition to the modulus (%) operator. The shift operators (&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt;&gt;)
and the bitwise operators (|, &amp;, ^, ~) do not work on floating point numbers. You can
always convert floating point numbers to integer value and perform the operation on the
integer value in case you need to perform these operations on floating point numbers.

Examining the Character Data Type and String Literals
</A></H4>

<P>Java makes a distinction between a character type and a sequence of characters
represented as a string literal. The character type holds a single character value.
Character values are unicode values that use 16 bits to represent a character. Internally,
the compiler treats the 16-bit unicode character as a 16-bit unsigned number. This
enables the Java language to handle the symbols used for non-English languages and leads
to internationalization of the language.
</P>

<P>A character type is represented by using the reserved word
char. The following is an example of character variable definitions.
</P>

<PRE>
char     m;
char     n, p, q;
char     r = `a';
</PRE>

<P>The previous statements define character variables. In the last definition of
character variable r, an initial value of `a' is also assigned. Character literals are enclosed in
single
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-55"><P>Page 55</P></A>



<P>quotes, such as the example of `a'. A character variable can be assigned literal
values, using statements such as the following:
</P>

<PRE>m = `I';
n = `T';
p = `h';
q = `I';
</PRE>

<P>What if you wanted to assign a character such as the linefeed or carriage return to
a character variable. These characters are not visible in a text editor, and attempting
to type these characters causes the text editor to insert a new line. To solve this
problem, escape sequences can be used to represent non-visible character values in a program.
</P>

<P>Table 3.4 shows the common escape code sequences used in Java. The numbers
in parentheses represent the unicode values for the escape codes.

</P>
<P>String literals are represented as a sequence of characters in double quotes. All
the escape codes that can be used for characters can be used in strings. The following
are examples of string literals:
</P>

<P>     &quot;blue&quot;
</P>

<P>     &quot;violet&quot;
</P>

<P>     &quot;Om!&quot;
</P>

<P>     &quot;Where I stand there is Morya!\nAnd in&quot;
</P>

<P>     &quot;I am embedding a tab \t here.&quot;
</P>

<P>     &quot;Java\u2122&quot;
</P>

<P>Note that if you want to embed a non-visible character such as a linefeed or a tab in <BR>
a string, you must use its escape code. Notice that the unicode character \u2122 in <BR>
the last example evaluates to the trademark symbol. If your display type does
not support the display of a unicode character, the corresponding symbol will not
be displayed. You must, therefore, configure your operating system and display
driver software for the appropriate unicode set to display the unicode characters.
</P>

<P>Java does not have a basic data type for strings; however, a String class is defined in
the language. The String class is used to define String objects. An advantage of defining
the string type as a class is that the language predefines a set of useful methods to
perform operations on strings at a high level. You have, for example, already seen the example
of the string concatenation operator &quot;+&quot; used as the argument to the
System.out.println() method in listings 3.2 and 3.3.
</P>

<P>When string literals are used in a Java program, the compiler automatically constructs
a String object, whose value is set to the string literal. This behavior is unusual
because for all other classes, one must explicitly construct the object of the class type.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 9">
Examining the Boolean Data Type
</A></H4>

<P>A Boolean data type can hold only two values&#151;true and false. This data type is used
to model states of behavior, such as an on or off value for a switch. The keyword
Boolean is used to describe this data type. The following are examples of Boolean
variables definitions:
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-57"><P>Page 57</P></A>


<PRE>
boolean         cond1
boolean   switch, state;
boolean   endOfList = false;
</PRE>

<P>A Boolean variable is set by assigning the literal values true or false. For example:
</P>

<PRE>
switch = true;
state = false;
</PRE>

<P>You cannot perform arithmetic operations on Boolean data types, but you can
perform logical operations on Boolean data values. Consider the following example:
</P>

<PRE>
boolean   bval1 = true;
boolean   bval2 = false;
boolean   bval3;
int            x = 3;
int            y = 9;
bval3 = bval1 &amp;&amp; bval2;
bval3 = bval1 || bval2;
bval3 = !bval3;
</PRE>

<P>The symbols &amp;&amp;, | |, ! stand for logical
and, logical or, and logical not, respectively. If you are not familiar with these Boolean operators, tables 3.5_3.7 will explain the
behavior of these Boolean operators. In these tables, the last column represents the result
of applying the operator on the preceding columns. By using these tables, you can
verify that the value of bval3 in the first assignment statement is false; the value of bval3 in
the second assignment statement is true; and the value of bval3 in the last
assignment statement is false.
