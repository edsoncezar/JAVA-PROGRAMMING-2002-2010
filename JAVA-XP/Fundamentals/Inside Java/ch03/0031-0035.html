Experimenting with Java<br>
Data Types and Variables

</H2>

<P>In the previous chapter, you learned how to write a simple Java <BR>
application. You were introduced to the concepts of types and <BR>
variables, and you saw an example that used two of Java's
basic types: the int and float types. This chapter will discuss in detail
other basic types in the Java language, the types of arithmetic operations <BR>
that can be performed, the type of data that can be represented, and
how you can mix and match data types. In addition, you will learn <BR>
to use one of Java's predefined Math class methods. At the end of <BR>
this chapter, you will be able to write Java programs of increased
complexity.

Overview of Java Data Types
</A></H3>

<P>Data types are used to represent the format and structure of data. <BR>
Most programs end up performing some operation on data that is represented in
the program by data types. In general, you can think of a data type as a description
or template of how the data is to be represented when the program is running.
Typically, this data is stored in the computer's memory when the program executes, and not
on secondary storage, such as a hard disk or a file on the network.
</P>

<P>It is important to remember that Java data types are templates for data. The actual data
is referenced by using variable identifiers in the language. Consider, for example,
the following variable definition:
</P>

<PRE>
int     delta;
</PRE>

<P>The int is the data type and the delta is a variable of type int. The int is the template
that is used by the Java compiler to allocate space in memory for a variable called delta
(see fig. 3.1). The number of bytes and the range of values represented by the data type int
is controlled by the attributes of that data type. In the Java language, int describes a
4-byte signed integer, and therefore the variable delta is allocated 4 bytes of memory, and it
can have a signed value ranging from _2**32 to 2**32; that is, from _2147483648
to 2147483647. In figure 3.1, the fact that int is a template is denoted by a dotted line
box representing the data type, and the actual space is allocated only when the variable
delta is defined. This is indicated by a solid line box.

<P>Java's built-in data types can be defined in terms of four categories (see fig. 3.2).
These categories are listed as follows:
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-33"><P>Page 33</P></A>



<UL>
<LI>          integer
<LI>          floating point
<LI>          character
<LI>          Boolean<BR>
</UL>

<P>

Figure 3.2
Java built-in data type categories.
</P>

<P>The integer and floating point categories consist of further subcategories that
describe the actual Java data types that are used in the language.
</P>

<P>The built-in data types described here are not objects. Objects are encapsulating
data, such as the data types discussed in this chapter (see fig. 3.3). Each of these objects
are typically encapsulated by one or more methods that act on the encapsulated data.
Figure 3.3 also shows a comparison between objects and Java data types. The example
shown is that of the Integer object and the Java data type int. The object Integer is the name
of a class that is predefined in the Java language. This Integer object is defined by
using the class syntax, and it defines methods that operate on the data representation of
the integer. If, for example, you create an instance of the object Integer, you can call
the methods such as parseInt() to convert a string representation of the integer to the Java
int data type. Because parseInt() is a static method, you could invoke its methods by using
the class name Integer. The following code fragment shows an example of how the
static method parseInt() can be used to convert the string &quot;314159&quot; to an int data type:
</P>

<PRE>
int     ivalue;
ivalue = Integer.parseInt(&quot;314159&quot;);
</PRE>

Variable Names and Identifiers
</A></H4>

<P>A variable's name is described by an identifier such as delta, in the example in
the previous section. Identifiers are names for language entities such as variables,
classes, and so on. An identifier in Java can be a sequence of unicode characters of
any length. For practical reasons, you may not want to abuse this lack of limitation in the length
of an identifier. Defining a variable, for example, whose name is 500 characters will not
only make the program difficult to create, but also create significant difficulties for
anyone who is trying to understand and modify the program.
</P>

<P>Some limitations exist on the characters that you can use to create the identifier. A
Java identifier must begin with a letter, followed by any combination of letters and digits.
A letter is set consisting of letters a_z, A_Z, the underscore (_), and dollar ($) characters.
If the unicode characters defining the scripts of other languages are used, then the
letter acquires a broader meaning and can include glyphs from scripts such as
Russian, Devanagari, Gurumukhi, Korean, Chinese, Farsi, Japanese, and so on.
</P>

Java Reserved Words
</A></H4>

<P>Although identifiers can be any combination of letters, some combination of letters
are reserved, and are therefore called reserved
words or keywords. The words int, float, and class, for example, that you encountered earlier are used in the Java language to
define
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-35"><P>Page 35</P></A>




<P>the data types of integer, floating point, and the class construct respectively.
These reserved words cannot be used for programmer defined names, such as names
for variables and objects.
</P>

<P>Table 3.1 defines a list of reserved words in the Java language. A number of
additional words appear to be language keywords, but actually are literal values. These are
the following words:
</P>

<PRE>
null      false      true
</PRE>

<P>The word null is used as a value for an object variable that has not been instantiated
(or defined). The words false and true are values for a boolean data variable. Because
these literals are similar to constants such as 314, 7.12, `c' and so on, they are not included
in table 3.1. Even though these literal words are not formally defined as the
language reserved words, you cannot use them as programmer defined names.
