JDBC

<P><b>I</b>n December 1995, when Java first became a household name,
          Java public relations materials promised that Java would excel
          in two areas. The first, Web page enhancement, has been
shown not only through animation applets, but also through such
useful examples as dynamically updating content. The second area in
which Java was prophecied to excel was in database access. Every
client-server developer dreams of being able to write once and deploy anywhere
(on any architecture running any operating system), and Java was said
to fulfill this dream.
</P>

<P>The claim of Web page enhancement came to fruition early, but
the second claim of database access has only recently begun to
appear. Although third-party proprietary solutions exist for Java
database access, JavaSoft has adapted the Microsoft ODBC standard in its
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) Application Programming Interface.
</P>

<P>This chapter focuses on databases in general, as well as writing
Java code to access those databases by using the JDBC. The text first offers
a lesson in database 101 and then explores the features of this
API, including relevant code examples. In addition, the chapter
evaluates alternative (third-party) technologies for database access from
Java applications and presents the compelling reasons for the
widespread acceptance of JDBC over proprietary solutions.

Database 101
</A></H3>

<P>As with any technology, relational database technology carries with it a series
of acronyms, special terms, and intimidation. This first section presents an overview
of relational database technology, but it is simply an introduction and should not be
taken as anything more. The information presented here is sufficient to get you up and
running with relational databases, but remember that becoming an expert on relational
database technology takes years of work. As an incentive, those experts usually command
six-figure salaries, so if you really enjoy what you learn in this section, you might
consider becoming an expert on the technology.

Logical Placement of Information
</A></H4>

<P>For the most part, database technology involves storing and retrieving information in
a logical manner. To start the discussion on database technology, table 17.1 defines
a series of terms used when discussing databases.

Definition
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Table
</TD><TD>
Data in a database is divided into a number of tables,
each of which stores related pieces of information. A
table can be treated as a giant grid of information.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Relations
</TD><TD>
Data in this category is unique to a given table but identical
 between two or more tables. A relation is used to
identify related rows in different tables.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Schema
</TD><TD>
A schema consists of the set of all tables and their
relations for a given database.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Row
</TD><TD>
A row contains the series of entries unique for the value
of a given variable.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Column
</TD><TD>
Data is defined within a column.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Cell
</TD><TD>
A unique entry in a table, a cell occurs where the
column and row meet at one location.
