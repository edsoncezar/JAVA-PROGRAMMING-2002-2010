<P>JavaSoft intends to provide a higher-level API over JDBC that will target
transparent objects and relational mapping, as well as enable the mapping of Java objects to one
or more relational database tables. JavaSoft also plans to enhance the capabilities of
the JDBC API to include increased cursor support and other useful features.
Currently, JavaSoft has plans for a Java Transaction Service API that will be designed to
enable Java programs to complete transactions across multiple databases (refer to

<P>Other non-relational DBMS-based options may be available to Java application
programmers who want to introduce persistence to their applications. The options presented
in the following sections are Persistence through Object Serialization and ODMG
Java Object Database Standard.

Object Persistence Using Object Serialization
</A></H4>

<P>For small applications, the amount of data involved may not be sufficient to warrant
the use of a DBMS. In such situations, it may be optimal to use Object Serialization
to emulate database functions such as persistence.
</P>

<P>Object Serialization involves mapping objects into an object output stream and
then reconstructing these objects from an object input stream.

Serialization has been mainly utilized for serializing objects into a byte stream

<P>Most common Java objects can be serialized by using the Object Serialization
system <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/serialization/index.html">
(http://www.javasoft.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/guide/serialization/index.html).</A>
 Serialization of user-defined classes requires the implementation of either the Serializable or
Externizable
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-813"><P>Page 813</P></A>



<P>interface. The difference between these two interfaces is that the object stream
for Serializable objects contains sufficient information for reconstructing an object from
the stream, whereas Externizable objects are solely responsible for their external formats
and reconstruction.
</P>

<P>Serialization can be used for persistence by creating files of objects. These files can
be used instead of databases, but it becomes the responsibility of the programmer both
to save all the objects in files (using serialization) before quitting the program and <BR>
to read these objects from files before starting execution again. The overheads
involved are quite considerable and increase rapidly with growing numbers of application
objects. An example of providing persistence for Java objects is Persistent Java

 created by Bill la Forge. Serialization has been used for persistence in other languages, such as C++, using products such as
the Tools h++ Class Library from RogueWave Software, Inc. (refer to

ODMG Java Object Database Standard
</A></H4>

<P>Object Database Management Group (ODMG) and JavaSoft created a new
working group in February 1996. The goal of this working group is to define an object
database standard for Java. Object databases are ideally suitable to represent Java objects in
a transparent and seamless manner. Key concepts of the standard include:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Transparent persistence
<LI>          Persistence by reachability
<LI>          Multiple implementations of Java binding
<LI>          Addition of classes to Java to implement the complete ODMG object model
</UL>

<P>Transparent persistence involves making active instances of Java objects
persistent without modifying existing code. Persistance by reachability requires that all objects
that can be reached from any root object be made persistent at commit-time. The
Java environment must be enhanced to fully comply with the ODMG object model.
This requires that classes and constructs such as collections, relationships, transactions,
and databases be added to Java.
</P>

<P>Currently, some products are designed for object-database support for Java.
These products include ObjectStore PSE (persistent storage engine) from ObjectStore
and POET for Java from POET. These products, however, do not claim to be compliant
with the new ODMG Java standard for object databases.

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter provided an overview of the aims and functions of JDBC, and the
documentation of the JDBC API should prove to be a valuable guide. The real-world
implementation scenario showed how JDBC is used to achieve better integration and flexibility for
a corporate enterprise, and you can extend the insight provided to other environments
as well. A comparison of JDBC with competing technologies showed a perspective that
can be used when you make decisions. As it evolves to provide wider functionality,
JDBC certainly is a technology worth watching and following.
