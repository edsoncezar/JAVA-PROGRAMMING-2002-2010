Management Systems (DBMSs). In addition, the Driver Manager loads the
requested driver and provides support for the managing database connections.
</P>

<P><B>JDBC Drivers
</P></B>

<P>Many vendors currently offer JDBC drivers. The following Web site contains a list
of these vendors:
</P>

<PRE>

</PRE>

<P>Drivers can be written in Java so that they can be downloaded along with an
applet. Drivers also can be implemented by using native methods to connect to database
access libraries. JavaSoft requires that a driver support at least ANSI SQL-92 Entry
Level functionality to pass the JDBC compliance tests.
</P>

<P>In general, the drivers should provide implementations of the abstract classes
specified in the JDBC API. Each database driver should provide a class that implements
the java.sql.Driver interface. This interface is used by the java.sql.DriverManager class
to locate a driver for a particular database URL. In addition, each driver must
provide implementations of the following interfaces:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          java.sql.Connection
<LI>          java.sql.Statement
<LI>          java.sql.PreparedStatement
<LI>          java.sql.CallableStatement
<LI>          java.sql.ResultSet
</UL>

<P>Drivers can be classified as indicated in the following sections.
</P>

<P><B>Native-API Partly Java Drivers
</P></B>

<P>This type of driver maps JDBC calls to calls on the client-API for Oracle,
Sybase, Informix, DB2, or other DBMSs. This driver also requires some binary code to be
loaded on each client machine. Among its uses, the driver can be utilized when
corporations want to develop Java applications and at the same time leverage their existing
investment in DBMSs that do not have ODBC drivers. Because the driver maps the JDBC calls
to client-API calls, the Java application does not need to contain  native DBMS
access code.
</P>

<P><B>Net-Protocol All-Java Drivers
</P></B>

<P>This type of driver is considered to be the most flexible type. It translates JDBC <BR>
calls to a DBMS-independent net protocol, which then can be translated to a
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-778"><P>Page 778</P></A>


<P>
vendor-specific DBMS protocol by a server. The key component in this setup is a
piece of middleware that sits between the client and the server. Due to the restriction that
Java applets cannot connect back to a host other than the one which served the applet
itself, this setup becomes a perfect solution. The middleware can sit at the server, and
communicate between the applet and the DBMS.
</P>

<P><B>Native-Protocol All-Java Driver
</P></B>

<P>This driver type translates JDBC calls to the network protocol used by the
vendor-specific DBMSs. DBMS vendors serve as the source for these drivers because many
of the protocols used in this scenario are proprietary. Using these drivers is a
feasible solution for intranet access because they enable a direct call from the client machine
to the DBMS server.
</P>

<P><B>The JDBC-ODBC Bridge
</P></B>

<P>The Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface is Microsoft's solution for a
DBMS-independent database access. ODBC, however, is not appropriate for direct use
from Java applications because it is a C interface. Calls from Java programs to native C
code involve certain drawbacks that would impact the security, implementation,
robustness, and automatic portability of these applications. Some ODBC binary code and, in
some cases, database client code must be loaded on each client machine that uses this
driver. As a result, this driver works well on a corporate network or in a three-tiered
architecture where application server code is written in Java.
</P>

<P>JDBC is based on the X/Open SQL Call Level Interface, which is also the basis
for ODBC. Due to the similarities of the two specifications, the JDBC-ODBC bridge is
quite small and efficient. The bridge, a joint development of JavaSoft and Intersolv,
translates JDBC calls to those that can be understood by ODBC clients at a C language level.
</P>

<P>The JDBC-ODBC bridge provides backward compatibility to a wide range of
databases that have released ODBC drivers, but do not have released JDBC drivers. Because
ODBC drivers have been out for years and are available for virtually any system, chances
are there is an ODBC driver for any system with which you may come into contact. The
fact, however, that JDBC is so new means that this is not the case for JDBC. JDBC has
been designed to be efficiently implemented on ODBC, so the bridge offers a way to
use ODBC from Java. The bridge package, sun.jdbc.odbc, is available for the Solaris and
NT/Win95 platforms and can be downloaded from the following Web page:

The JDBC Driver Test Suite
</A></H4>

<P>JavaSoft and Intersolv have jointly developed a JDBC driver test suite that
nicely profiles the capabilities of a JDBC driver. This test suite is an attempt to ensure
the portability of applications across different JDBC drivers. As of now, it is not intended
as a driver certification.
</P>

<P>The JDBC Test Harness and the JDBC Test Suite are available for download at
the following Web page:
</P>

<PRE>

http://splash.javasoft.com/jdbc/index.html
</PRE>

<P>Both are needed to test a JDBC driver.
</P>

Interfaces and Classes
</A></H3>

<P>The JDBC API contains a collection of interfaces that enable the primary functions
of opening and managing connections to particular DBMSs, executing SQL statements,
and processing the results. The JDBC API also adds functionality in the form of
cursors, transaction management, dynamic database access, and metadata. Three
exception handling classes, which are essential to any robust application, are also provided.
The java.sql package contains the following interfaces:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Driver
<LI>          Connection
<LI>          Statement
<LI>          CallableStatement
<LI>          PreparedStatement
<LI>          ResultSet
<LI>          DatabaseMetaData
<LI>          ResultSetMetaData
</UL>

<P>The java.sql package contains the following classes:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          DriverManager
<LI>          DriverPropertyInfo
<LI>          Date
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-780"><P>Page 780</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>          Time
<LI>          Timestamp
<LI>          Types
</UL>

<P>The following are the exception classes:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          DataTruncation
<LI>          SQLException
<LI>          SQLWarning
</UL>

<P>Figure 17.3 illustrates the interaction between the commonly used interfaces and classes.

members and methods is beyond the scope of this chapter, the sections detail the most
