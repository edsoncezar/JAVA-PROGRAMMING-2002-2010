<PRE>
WHERE CourseID = 00756
</PRE>

<P>Of course, an equally valid alternate form would be the following:
</P>

<PRE>
UPDATE Courses
SET Professor = &quot;Leno&quot;
WHERE CourseName = &quot;Sweating Off Those Pounds&quot;
</PRE>

<P><B>DELETE
</P></B>

<P>The DELETE reserved word is used to construct statements that delete one or more
rows from a given table. The correct syntax follows:
</P>

<PRE>
DELETE &lt;table name&gt;
WHERE &lt;condition&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Let's return to the example of Professor Simmons. Suppose that one day the
Professor decides to leave academia to pursue a career producing workout videos. Given
this situation, all courses taught by him would have to be removed from the COURSES
table. The correct SQL to remove these rows follows:
</P>

<PRE>
DELETE Courses
WHERE Professor = &quot;Simmons&quot;
</PRE>
<P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BGCOLOR="#FFFF99">
<TR><TD><B>
TIP
</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When dealing with this statement, remember that it deletes an entire row. To
delete individual cells in a given row, use the UPDATE keyword to change the value of the
cell in question to a blank value.
</BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<P><B>AND
</P></B>

<P>In the above sections on the various SQL reserved words, all operations were
performed on a single table. This, however, ignores the fact that relations between tables
are maintained. For this reason, the AND reserved word is used to perform operations
on two or more tables. Remember that the beginning of this chapter introduced the
example of selecting the names of all students who had received an A in the course with
ID 00042. By using both the SELECT and AND reserved words, the correct SQL to
extract all student names who received an A in the course with ID 00042 follows:
</P>

<PRE>
SELECT Students.Name
FROM Students, Grades
WHERE Grades.Grade = &quot;A&quot;
AND Students.StudentID = Grades.StudentID
</PRE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-774"><P>Page 774</P></A>



<P>The preceding example introduces two new concepts: First, the management of
multiple tables. Secondly, the use of multiple conditions in the WHERE clause. Perhaps
most noteworthy about this statement is the new notation used when specifying
columns. Because column names must only be unique for a table rather than the entire schema,
it is necessary to indicate the exact table to which each column belongs. It is for
that reason that the notation &lt;table name&gt;.&lt;column
name&gt; is used.
</P>

<P>One final note on the AND reserved word: Some situations exist where this word is
used for operations on one table. To select, for example, all courses where the student with
ID 00011 received an A, the following SQL is used:
</P>

<PRE>
SELECT CourseID
FROM Grades
WHERE Grade = &quot;A&quot;
AND StudentID = 00011
</PRE>

<P>To expand on this example, use the following SQL to select the names of the
courses where the student with ID 00011 received an A:
</P>

<PRE>
SELECT Courses.CourseName
FROM Courses, Grades
WHERE Grades.Grade = &quot;A&quot;
AND Grades.StudentID = 00011
AND Courses.CourseID = Grades.CourseID
</PRE>

<P>Now that we've covered the basics of databases, it's time to relate databases to the
topic at hand, JDBC.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch17_ 5">
Introducing JDBC
</A></H3>

<P>As the beginning of this chapter indicated, Java's cross-platform capabilities lead one
to realize that some technology for accessing relational databases from a Java
application (or applet) is necessary. This technology is the Java Database Connectivity
Standard (JDBC).
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 6">
What is JDBC?
</A></H4>

<P>JDBC is intended as a call-level SQL interface that provides Java programmers with
a uniform interface to a wide range of relational databases. JDBC is similar in concept
to Microsoft's Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API, which has become the
standard for relational database access. Because virtually all database engines offer
access using </P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-775"><P>Page 775</P></A>


<P>
the ODBC standard, and because the JDBC standard enables Java code to
perform ODBC calls, it is easy to understand why JDBC is preferred over other
non-open propitiatory standards.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 7">
What Does JDBC Do?
</A></H4>

<P>As you noted when studying SQL at the beginning of this chapter, SQL is an
excellent language for managing data when stored in a series of tables. The primary function
of JDBC is managing data stored in tables. To fulfill this function, JDBC defines
Java classes to represent such elements as database connections, SQL statements,
result sets, and metadata. These classes and interfaces are written in Java, so they provide
a natural interaction with relational databases.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 8">
JDBC Release Information
</A></H4>

<P>The JDBC 1.1 version is currently available. This
version, included in JDK 1.1 (Java Development Kit), can be downloaded as a compressed .tar file or a .zip file from
the following Web page:
</P>

<PRE>

http://splash.javasoft.com/jdbc/index.html
</PRE>

<P>Although this site includes the .java and the .html files for the API, it does not
include any database drivers. A database driver acts as a middleman between your
executing Java code and the relational database. For JBDC to work properly, the relational
database being used must either provide a native implementation of JDBC or there must be a
driver available for that database in question. The topic of database drivers is elaborated
on later in this chapter. The JDBC 1.1 specification is available from the JavaSoft site as
a postscript or acrobat file.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch17_ 9">
Examining the Application Programming Interface of JDBC
</A></H3>

<P>Instead of using methods that take many parameters to control a wide range of
behavior, the Java core classes have been designed to use different methods to perform
different tasks. The JDBC API maintains this pattern.

figure are examples of driver names.

<P>This list summarizes the key components that the following sections discuss:

<UL>
<LI>          Driver Manager
<LI>          Drivers
<LI>          Native-API Partly Java Drivers
<LI>          Net-Protocol All-Java Drivers
<LI>          Native-Protocol All-Java Drivers
<LI>          JDBC-ODBC Bridge
</UL>

<P><B>Driver Manager
</P></B>

<P>Where drivers provide the interface between the application and the
vendor-specific DBMS, the Driver Manager controls the interaction between the application and
the driver being used. It can support multiple drivers connecting to different
Database
