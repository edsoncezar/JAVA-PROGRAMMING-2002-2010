IN parameters that are required for this procedure are set between lines 70 and 73.
The command call_stmt.executeUpdate(); actually executes the CallableStatement.

Some drivers may send the call statement to the database when the
prepareCall() method is invoked. Others wait until the
executeUpdate() method of the CallableStatement is
invoked. As a result, it is good programming practice to try to catch exceptions for both
the prepareCall() and executeUpdate() methods.

<P>The statement, boolean successful =
call_stmt.getBoolean(1) from line 81 extracts the Boolean
value returned by the stored procedure to determine whether the transaction was
successful. The last four lines of code are fairly straightforward.
</P>

<P><B>Step Four: Cleaning Up
</P></B>

<P>Now that the transaction has been completed, it is good practice to release all
resources that the application may have obtained. Each of the Statement objects used can
be released by using the close() method. The following code, for example, releases
the resources held by Statement object, stmt1:
</P>

<PRE>
          stmt1.close();
</PRE>

<P>This process should be repeated for each Statement object created by the application.
</P>

<P>Finally, the database connections should be released. This is also achieved by using
the close() method. The following, for example, closes Connection object, connection1,
and releases the resources held by this connection:
</P>

<PRE>
          connection1.close();
</PRE>

<P>Overall, JDBC aided H2O in creating the desired Web shop by leveraging their
system infrastructure by using this modern technology.

Comparing JDBC with Existing <BR>
Database Access Technologies for <BR>
the World Wide Web
</A></H3>

<P>Using the World Wide Web as a medium for business prompted many technologies
that enable database access over the Web. Of particular note among these technologies
is
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-810"><P>Page 810</P></A>


<P>Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, as it is popularly known. This section compares
the JDBC approach to some of the existing Web-based database access
technologies, namely the following:
</P>


<UL>
<LI>          CGI scripts
<LI>          Java API for databases
<LI>          Vendor tools for database access from the Web
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 37">
CGI Scripts
</A></H4>

<P>Common Gateway Interface scripts are a common and widely used technology that
can be used to access a database from the Web and interact with databases on a
server. These scripts can be implemented by using a variety of languages, including C,
C++, Perl, and Python. Scripts interact with a user through the medium of HTML
documents and present their output information by creating HTML documents live.
</P>

<P>Prior to Java and JDBC, CGI scripts epitomized the term &quot;dynamic&quot; Web interaction.
CGI scripts could communicate with a database on a server by using either an
Application Programming Interface (API) or an embedded SQL. The scripts could present
the required information to the user by using a well-understood and easy-to-use
medium&#151;HTML.
</P>

<P>CGI scripts, however, also have several shortcomings. Because CGI scripts cannot
truly provide dynamic content&#151;they actually run on the back-end server&#151;the server
bears the complete responsibility of all the required computation. This produces fat
servers, servers with heavy amounts of processing, and thin clients, machines that
process virtually no data, which are not desirable system characteristics.
</P>

<P>In contrast, the combination of JDBC and Java is a truly dynamic duo. The
client performs processing while the server is used only when actual database access
is required. Furthermore, the Java API includes a package called java.awt, which is
devoted to the creation and manipulation of graphical components. (AWT stands for
Abstract Windowing Toolkit.) The java.awt package provides a more flexible and powerful
means of designing user interfaces; HTML, although simple to use, lacks some of the
features provided by java.awt.
</P>


<P>Most importantly, CGI scripts are known to be weak security links in a system.
In comparison, JDBC provides a more secure environment. Remember, though, that
the JDBC is relatively new, so not everything is known about it yet.

</P>
<P>With client/server design issues, JDBC offers a much better approach than CGI
scripts,
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-811"><P>Page 811</P></A>


<P>for the following reasons:

<UL>
<LI>          JDBC does not have the problem of a fat server and thin client.
<LI>          JDBC can be used with any DBMS that provides a JDBC driver. JDBC also can
be used with any DBMS that can be accessed through an ODBC driver. This can
be accomplished by using the JDBC-ODBC bridge (provided by JavaSoft
and Intersolv).
<LI>          JDBC provides metadata about the SQL query results.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 38">
Java API for Databases
</A></H4>

<P>An increasing number of databasevendors may provide a Java API for database
access. MsqlJava, a Java API for mSQL, is one example(refer to
<a href="http://www.minmet.uq.oz.au/msqljava/).">
http://www.minmet.uq.oz.au/msqljava/).</A> By using a Java database API produces a seamless integration of database access
code within the application, so that it is a more desirable approach than CGI scripts.
</P>

<P>Using a Java database API, however, restricts the application to the particular DBMS
for which the Java API is provided. This factor renders JDBC as the better option.
Furthermore, not many DBMSs come with a Java API. (To this author's knowledge, mSQL is
the only DBMS that provides a Java API.)
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 39">
Vendor Tools for Database Access from the <BR>
Web
</A></H4>

<P>Some DBMS vendors provide tools for Web access. Microsoft's SQL Server
Web Assistant, a non-CGI solution for database access from the Web, serves as one
example (refer to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platforms/doc/backoff/sqldrop/hydra/admin/src/adminwn_4.htm">
http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platforms/doc/backoff/sqldrop/hydra/admin/src/adminwn_4.htm</A>
). The Web Assistant is mainly used to create HTML pages on a prescheduled,
triggered basis. For more information on how to use Microsoft SQL Server in the Internet
environment, refer to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/sqlinet1.htm.">
http://www.microsoft.com/sql/sqlinet1.htm.</A>
</P>

<P>Using these kinds of tools limits the Web application, however, to a particular DBMS
or a particular vendor, which is not a desirable characteristic of any application.
</P>


<P>As with any new technology, only time will show what will become of it. It is hoped
that JavaSoft will aid in Object to relational mappings; currently, however, JDBC is a
strong API for developing client/server applications in Java.
