<P><I>Karanjit S. Siyan's Acknowledgments</I>
</P>

<P>One of the more pleasurable tasks of being an author is to thank the
people responsible for the success of a book. My heartfelt thanks to my wife Dei for
her love and support. I wish to thank my father, Ahal Singh, and my
mother Tejinder; my brothers Harjeet, Jagjit; my sisters Kookie and Dolly. Thanks also
to Margaret Cooper Scott, Cathryn and Bob Foley, Craig and Lydia Cooper,
Robert and Janie Cooper, Heidi and Steve Bynum, Barbara and Edward L.
Scott (Scotty), and Jacquelyn McGregor for their love and support. Special thanks
to Mother, Saint Germain, El Morya Khan, Bhagwan Krishna and Babaji.
Without their spiritual support, this book would not have been possible.
</P>

<P>I want to thank Bob Sanregret and Anders Amundson, who initially got
me interested in writing teaching materials about computers. I also wish to thank
the many people at Learning Tree for their help and support on various projects.
In particular I would like to thank John Moriarty, Rick Adamson, Dr.
David Collins, Eric Garen, Marti Sanregret, Richard Beaumont, Mark Drew,
David O'Neil, and Robin Johnston. Boyd Badten created, at a very short notice,
the graphic image files for the animation applet discussed in this book.
Thanks Boyd!
</P>

<P>I wish to thank Marta Partington and Naomi Goldman for their help in
developing this book. Special thanks to Don Fowley, Jim LeValley, Sean Angus,
Gina Brown, Nancy Maragioglio, and Krista Hansing for their help with this book.
I also wish to thank Drew and Blythe Heywood for their friendship,
support, and encouragement throughout the many years it has been my pleasure to
know them.
</P>

<P><I>Jim Weaver's Acknowledgments</I>
</P>

<P>Thanks to all the people at New Riders that worked so hard to make this book
a reality. A special thanks to Sean and Nancy for giving me the opportunity
to co-author this book, and to Gina Brown, Naomi Goldman, Krista Hansing, and
Jim Mathis for their expertise and diligence in editing. I also appreciate Colin
for recommending me to New Riders.
</P>

<P>Thanks to Julie Weaver, Lori Weaver, Kelli Weaver, Marilyn Prater,
Walter Weaver, and Ken Prater for their love and support. Thanks to God who
always manages to make things in my life
&quot;work together for good.&quot;
</P>

<P>Congratulations and thanks to the past and present members of the
JavaSoft team. They have produced technology that is enabling a revolution in
the Information Technology industry, and is fun to use as well!
