Implementing Java <BR>
Exception Handling

</H2>

<P><B>J</B>ava provides a robust method for handling error conditions by 
     providing a language construct for handling these errors. This 
     language construct is the exceptional handling capability that was
          mentioned in earlier chapters.
</P>

<P>This chapter discusses exceptional handling in greater detail. You
learn how exceptions are defined and activated&#151;a process called throwing
an exception. Exceptions that are thrown must be caught or they will
result in the termination of the program. You will learn how to catch
these exceptions and process them. You will learn about the prebuilt
exceptions in the Java language and how to define your own exceptions.

Understanding Exceptions
</A></H3>

<P>As part of executing a program, any number of error conditions may be
encountered. Some of these errors may be expected, such as the potential for an end-of-file error
when reading a file; although others may be totally unexpected, such as an arithmetic
error resulting from dividing an integer by zero.
</P>

<P>In many languages, an attempt is made to anticipate the error conditions by checking
the status of status variables for these error conditions. The problem with this approach
is that most programmers are not disciplined enough to check for every error condition,
or they are so rushed for time that they skip the error checking in favor of getting a
working version of the program. They may have every good intention of returning to the
program to add the code to check for errors, but, alas, this seldom seems to happen. So
the program is full of potential errors that are just waiting to happen, or it is filled with
error-checking code for every conceivable error condition. The latter approach,
although resulting in programs that have fewer bugs, also leads to somewhat unreadable
programs because of all the error-checking code.
</P>

<P>Languages such as Java provide a cleaner method of handling exceptions. When
writing a new method, a Java programmer can identify all the potential error conditions that
the caller should be able to handle. The method should try to handle as many error
conditions as it can within the logic of the method, but there are certain situations, such as
the &quot;end-of-file&quot; condition, that a caller should handle. These potential error conditions
are called exceptions. All such potential error conditions are made part of the definition
of the method, and they become an important part of the method's contract. Anyone
who calls the method must handle these error conditions&#151;this is enforced by the
Java compiler.
</P>

<P>Within the method, a programmer codes the logic so that when an exceptional
condition is encountered, an exception is
<I>thrown</I> or <I>raised</I>. A thrown exception must be
<I>caught</I> at the point of the method invocation. If there is no explicit mechanism to catch the
thrown exception, the exception is propagated up the chain of methods that resulted in the
call to the method that raised the exception. If the exception is not explicitly caught, a
default handler is invoked. This default handler usually prints some useful information about
the exception and terminates the program.

The Exception Class
</A></H4>

<P>All exceptions defined in Java must extend either to the Throwable class or the
Exception class. Figure 10.1 shows the relationship between the major exception
classes. Throwable is subclassed from the Object class, and Exception is subclassed from
