Java Flow Control

</H2>

<P>In the previous chapter, you learned about the different Java
basic data types. You may have noticed that in all the examples
in the previous chapters, only the assignment statement was
discussed. Furthermore, in these examples, the statements were executed
sequentially one after another. Programs that are used to model real-life
systems are seldom that simple. You are often required to execute
statements depending on a test condition.
</P>

<P>Java provides many statements to affect the flow of logic within
a program, so that depending upon a Boolean condition that is evaluated,
a different part of the program is executed. In this chapter you learn
to control the sequence of statements that are executed in a program.
These statements are generically referred to as control flow
statements and include statements such as the if-statement, while-statement,
do-while statement, switch statement, and so on.

Understanding Types of Statements
</A></H3>

<P>For the sake of a better understanding, the different Java statements can be grouped
into the following categories (see fig. 4.1):
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Assignment statement
<LI>          Expression statement
<LI>          Block statement<BR>

Assignment Statement
</A></H4>

<P>You have seen mostly examples of assignment statements in previous chapters.
Assignment statements have the following general syntax:
</P>

<PRE>
L-value = expression { = expression };
</PRE>

<P>The L-value is any program item to which a value can be assigned. The most
common examples of this are variables such as those discussed in Chapter 3, &quot;Experimenting
with Java Data Types and Variables.&quot; The expression
could be an arithmetic expression or a Boolean expression consisting of Boolean operators and relational operators <BR>
( &lt;  &gt;  ==  !=  &lt;=  &gt;=). The value of
expression is assigned to the L-value. The type of
the expression must be consistent with the type of the
L-value. You, for example, cannot assign a Boolean expression to an int type variable. Among integers and floating
point
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-77"><P>Page 77</P></A>



<P>types, you can perform an assignment with the general rule that the precision and
range of the expression should not exceed that of the
L-value. Between integer and floating point data types, you can force a conversion by using a
type cast. You can, for example, force a conversion from a double floating point expression to a long type, but it
will result in a loss of precision. Consider the following example:
</P>

<PRE>
long          circumference;
double     PI = 3.1415926536;
double      radius = 33.0;
circumference = (long) 2.0 * PI * radius;
</PRE>

<P>The use of the cast specifier (long) for the double floating point expression converts
it into a long type, but any fractional part in the numeric value is lost.
</P>

<P>The use of the braces { } in the syntax of the assignment statement indicates that
the contents within braces can occur zero or more times. The { } characters serve as
meta-characters to describe the syntax of the assignment statement and are not part of
the assignment statement. This form of assignment statement is convenient because it
can be used to set several variables to the same value, as seen in the following fairly
common example where several variables need to be set to the same value:
</P>

<PRE>
short  x, y, z;

x = y = z =  0;
</PRE>

<P>Another form of assignment statement combines an arithmetic operator, shift, or
bitwise operator with the assignment operator. The general syntax of this assignment operator
is the following:
</P>

<PRE>
L-value op= expression;
</PRE>

<P>The L-value and expression have the same meaning as discussed before, and
op is any of the following operators:
</P>

<P>     +   _   *   /   %   &gt;&gt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;&lt;   &amp;   ^   |
</P>

<P>The above assignment statement is equivalent to the following:
</P>

<P>     L-value = (L-value) op (expression);
</P>

<P>Notice the parentheses around the expressions. Therefore, the following statement
</P>

<P>     a *= b_c;
</P>

<P>is actually the following:
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-78"><P>Page 78</P></A>



<P>     a = a * (b_c);
</P>

<P>rather than
</P>

<P>     a = a*b_c;
</P>

<P>Essentially, this type of statement is a shortcut expression. Here are some examples
of this statement:
</P>

<PRE>
int     x = 1;
int      y = 7;

x += 1;     // x is now 2
y _= 3;     // y is now 4
x &lt;&lt;= 1;     // x is now 4
y &gt;&gt;= 1;     // y is now 2
y *= x + 1;     // y is now 10
y /= x _2;     // y is now 5
y %= 3;     // y is now 2
y ^= 3;     // y is now 1

x &amp;= 2;     // x is now 0
y |= 3;     // y is now 3
</PRE>

<P>Assignment operators of the type just described can be quite intuitive to
understand. When, for example, you want to increase x by 4, you do not say &quot;take x add 4, and
then assign it to x.&quot; Instead, it is more natural to say &quot;add 4 to x.&quot; This is exactly what is
meant by the expression x += 4.

The L-value op= expression expression preserves compatibility with C and
C++. Originally, this existed in the C language as an aid for compilers to
perform optimization. In the case of +=, for example, the compilers could generate code
that would evaluate the right-hand side and add it to the
L-value.

Expression Statement
</A></H4>

<P>An expression statement is any expression that is on a line by itself and ends with
a semicolon. In truth, the assignment statement is also an expression statement
because the following construct is an expression:
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-79"><P>Page 79</P></A>



<P>     L-value = expression
</P>

<P>Therefore, any of the following are expressions:
</P>

<PRE>
x = 0
y = 3
</PRE>

<P>Notice, that these expressions do not end in a semicolon. If they did, they would
become an expression statement&#151;also called an assignment statement, in this case, because
of the use of the assignment (=) operator.
</P>

<P>An expression statement is the expression followed by a statement. Consider
the following:
</P>

<PRE>
long     z = 11;

++z;
</PRE>

<P>This expression statement has the result of incrementing the value of z by 1. It
is equivalent to each of the following expression statements:
</P>

<PRE>
z += 1;
z = z + 1;
z++;
</PRE>

<P>Similarly, the decrement operator can be used as an expression operator. Thus,
the following statements are all equivalent:
</P>

<PRE>
--z;
z--;
z _= 1;
z = z_1;
</PRE>

<P>Each of these expressions results in a change in value. If, however, you write
the following statement in Java, it will not result in any change in value:
</P>

<PRE>
x + 3;
</PRE>

<P>Although this statement compiles correctly, it is a useless statement because it does
not cause any change in the program logic. The reason for this is because there is no
L-value in the statement.
