<P>The Boolean variable endChar is defined on line 18 and initialized to a value of false.
This variable is checked in the while statement on line 28. The while statement exits when
the endChar variable is set to true. On line 54, the endChar variable is set to true, when
it encounters a non-digit or non-whitespace character, at which time the variable termCh
is set to indicate the terminating character (see line 55). The switch statement is used
to classify the input character. If it is a digit, the statement nDigits++ on line 44 keeps a
tally of the number of digits encountered. If the input character is a whitespace (blank, tab,
or newline), the statement nWhiteSpaces++ on line 50 keeps a tally of the
whitespace characters.
</P>

<P>On exiting the while statement, the statements on lines 64_68 print a report on
the classification of the input characters. Figure 4.9 shows the output of executing
the program in listing 4.5 by using the javac compiler. This program can be found on
the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.

The for Statement
</A></H4>

<P>The for statement also implements a loop, but unlike the while statement it
contains specific constructs for a loop variable initilization, loop test condition, and loop
variable change. The general syntax of the for statement is shown next:
</P>

<PRE>
     for (initStmt  boolExpr; incrExpr)<BR>
          statement
</PRE>

<P>Before the start of the loop the initStmt is executed. This inital statement could be
any statement; it is typically an assignment statement that initializes the value of a
loop variable that is used to control the execution of the loop. Here are some examples
of these assignment statements.
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-104"><P>Page 104</P></A>



<PRE>
x = 0;
y = 10;
z = MIN_VAL + 1;
</PRE>

<P>In these examples the loop variables, x, y, and z, had to be defined earlier in the
program. Because initStmt can also be a statement that defines a variable with an initial value,
you can use the following forms of initStmt:
</P>

<PRE>
int   x = 0;
long  y = 10;
short z = MIN_VAL + 1;
</PRE>

<P>The initStmt is evaluated just once, when the for loop is executed. After the
initStmt is evaluated, the boolExpr is evaluated. If the evaluation yields a true value, the
statement is executed; if it yields a false value, the for loop is terminated and execution
proceeds with the next statement after the for loop. The
statement can be any statement including a block statement. At the end of
statement execution, the incrExpr is evaluated.
The incrExpr is used typically to change the value of the loop variable that was set up in
the initStmt. After the incrExpr has been evaluated, the control is transferred to the top
of the loop, and boolExpr is evaluated again. It is important to realize that
initStmt is outside the loop, just before the loop begins.
</P>

<P>The for loop is actually equivalent to the following while statement:
</P>

<PRE>
{
      initStmt
      while (boolExpr)
      {
            statement
            incrExpr;
      }
}
</PRE>

<P>In a later section (see section &quot;The continue Statement&quot;), you will learn about
the continue statement that transfers control to the top of the loop and skips the
remaining statements. If, however, a continue statement occurs as part of the statement,
the incrExpr is always executed before transferring control to the top of the loop.
</P>

<P>Figure 4.10 shows the logic flow diagram for a for statement.
</P>

<P>Consider the following example of a for loop.
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-105"><P>Page 105</P></A>



<PRE>
int     fiats;
int     sum;
int     MAX_FIATS = 18;

for (fiats = 0; fiats &lt; MAX_FIATS; fiats++)
sum += fiats*9;<BR>
</PRE>

<P>
<a href="images\ch04fg10.jpg"><img src="images\tn_ch04fg10.jpg"></a><BR>
Figure 4.10
Logic flow diagram for a for statement.
</P>

<P>In this for loop, fiats is the loop varaiable.
The loop variable is also called the iteration
variable. In this example, the initStmt is fiats = 0; the
boolExpr is fiats &lt; MAX_FIATS, and the incrExpr is fiats++. The
statement is sum += fiats*9, and is executed 18 times.
</P>

<P>The previous for loop is executed 18 times with the loop variable iterating through
the values of 0 to 17. When the loop terminates, the loop variable, fiats, is set to 18.
</P>
