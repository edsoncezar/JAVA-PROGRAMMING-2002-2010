<P>A block statement is a grouping of statements within { } brackets. Examine the
method main() from the previous chapters. It has the following general syntax:
</P>

<PRE>
public static void main(String args[])
{
   // statements
}
</PRE>

<P>The block statement is shown in bold, and it consists of statements. These
statements can be definitions of Java basic types, assignment, control flow, or even another
block statement. A block statement can occur wherever a statement can occur in a
Java program. A block statement is also called a compound
statement.
</P>

<P>Consider the program listing 4.1 of a sample
main() program:

<P>In listing 4.1, x and y on lines 13 and 14 are defined and initialized at the start of the
main() method. The variables, such as x, y, and z have a scope. The
scope is the region of a program over which the variable can be referenced by its name. The scope of a
variable is the region of program text from its of definition to the end of the enclosing
block. Therefore, the point of x is from lines 13_33, and the scope of y is from lines 14_33.
</P>

<P>Lines 18_27 define a block statement. Within this block statement is a declaration for
z on line 19. The scope of z is therefore from line 19 to the end of the enclosing block
on line 27. The variable z cannot be referenced outside this block. An attempt to reference
z outside the block on line 31 will produce a syntax error. You can verify this by
compiling this program contained in file BlockStmt.java on the CD-ROM that accompanies
this book. Figure 4.2 shows the javac compiler error message that says that variable z is
not

<P>To fix the compiler error in listing 4.1, you must define a variable z, such as that
shown on line 29 in listing 4.2. Figure 4.3 shows that this second variation of the
BlockStmt program compiles without error, and figure 4.4 shows the result of executing
this program.
</P>

<P>Figure 4.4 shows that the value of x that is incremented on line 21 in listing 4.2 is
reported correctly inside the block statement and outside the block statement. The value of y
is unchanged from its initial value of 5. The value of z is reported differently inside
the block and ouside the block. Inside the block the value of z is 21, and outside the
block the value of z is 66. The two zs on lines 19 and 29 are different; they have
different scopes and are allocated memory in distinct memory locations.

The Control Flow Statements
</A></H3>

<P>The Java language defines several forms of control flow statements. These
statements can be categorized as follows (see fig. 4.5):
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          if statement
<LI>          switch statement
<LI>          while statement
<LI>          for statement
<LI>          do-while statement
<LI>          break statement
</UL>

</P>

<UL>
<LI>          continue statement
<LI>          return statement
</UL>

<P>These statements are discussed in the sections that follow.

The if Statement
</A></H4>

<P>The if statement is the most basic form of statement to execute statements based
upon the evaluation of a conditional expression. In the if statement, a Boolean expression
is evaluated. If the result of the Boolean expression is true, a certain <BR>
group of statements is executed; if the result is false, another group of statements
is executed.
</P>

<P>The following example shows the general syntax of the if statement:
</P>

<PRE>
if (booleanExpression)

      statement-true

[else

      statement-false]
</PRE>

<P>The booleanExpression is any of the Boolean expression types discussed in Chapter
3. The statement-true is any legal Java statement including the block statement, and it
is executed if booleanExpression evaluates to true. Similarly, the
statement-false is any legal Java statement including the block statement, and it is executed
if booleanExpression evaluates to false. The
statement-true is also called the then-
