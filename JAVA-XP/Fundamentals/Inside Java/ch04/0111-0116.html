Figure 4.12
Compilation of corrected program ForStmt2.
</P>

<P>Listing 4.8 shows such a program. This program in listing 4.8 is in the
file ForNesting.java in the CD-ROM that accompanies this book. The first for loop
from lines 18_22 prints out the column numbers. The many
System.out.println()
statements are for printing out the row, column labels, and the actual product.
</P>

<P>The outermost for loop is from lines 29_53; the innermost for loop is from lines
42_49. For each value of y of the outermost loop, a complete run of the innermost loop
is made.

The do-while Statement
</A></H4>

<P>The do-while statement is another type of loop statement. Recall that in the while and
for statements, the Boolean test is performed at the top of the loop. In the do-while
statement, the Boolean test is performed at the end of the loop. The general syntax of the
do-while statement is shown next:
</P>

<PRE>
do
        statement
while  (boolExpr);
</PRE>

<P>The statement can be any Java statement, including the block statement. The
boolExpr is the test condition for the loop. The
statement is executed first. Next, the Boolean expression,
boolExpr, is evaluated. If this evaluates to true, control is transferred to
the top of the loop. If the Boolean expression evaluates to false, the loop is terminated
and control is transferred to the end of the loop.
</P>

<P>Figure 4.14 shows the logic flow diagram of a do-while statement.

Figure 4.14
Logic flow diagram of a do-while statement.
</P>

<P>The following example shows the use of a do-while statement:
</P>

<PRE>
int   x = 0;
int   xpoints;

// Value of xpoints is set through some
// calculations.
xpoints = 20;

System.out.println(&quot;Table of exponent values\n&quot;)
do
{
      y = Math.exp((double)x);
      System.out.println(&quot;texp(&quot;+x+&quot;) =\t&quot;+y);

} while (x++ &lt; points);
</PRE>

<P>The do-while statement is used less frequently than the while and for loop statements.
It is primarily useful in situations where the statement in the loop needs to be executed
at least once, regardless of the Boolean test condition.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 12">
The break Statement
</A></H4>

<P>In the discussion on switch statements, you saw how the break statement can be used
to exit out of a switch statement. The break statement can be used to exit any block, not
just a switch statement. A break statement is typically used in a for, while, do-while loop
to exit the innermost loop. Thus, if you have nested loops, a break statement in any
loop will only exit the innermost loop in which the break statement occurs.
</P>

<P>The following is the general syntax of the break statement:
</P>

<PRE>
break [label];
</PRE>

<P>The label is optional. Without the label, the innermost enclosing block is exited. You
can use the label to break out of several nested loops.
</P>

<P>Consider the following example of using a break statement:
</P>

<PRE>
for (int x = 0; x &lt; 1000; x++)
{
      y += x*2;
      if  (y % 500 == 333)
      break;

} // end for
</PRE>

<P>The preceding for loop would normally exit when the value of x becomes 1000. A
test condition, however, is performed in the if statement. If this condition is met, the
break statement will be executed, and it will cause the premature termination of a for loop.
</P>

<P>Consider another example of a labeled for loop:
</P>

<PRE>
outer:
for (int x = 0; x &lt; 100; ++x)
{
      for (int y = 0; y &lt; 100; ++y)
      {
         int   z = x*y;
         if (z == 6003)
            break outer;
         else if (z == 2475)
            break;

         } // end for

} // end for
</PRE>




<A NAME="PAGENUM-116"><P>Page 116</P></A>



<P>The outermost loop is labeled with the label outer: In the innermost loop there are
two break statements. The first break statement will be executed if the value of z
becomes 6003, at which time the outermost, and hence also the innermost loop, will terminate.
The second break statement does not have a label. It will be executed only when the value
of z becomes 2475, at which time only the innermost loop will terminate; it will not affect
the outer loop.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 13">
The continue Statement
</A></H4>

<P>The continue statement is used inside a loop to skip the remaining statements in the
loop and to go to the top of the loop. At the top of the loop, the Boolean expressions, if
any, are evaluated and the rest of the loop execution continues.
</P>

<P>The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and go on to
the next iteration. If a continue statement is executed in a while statement, the
Boolean expression at the top of the loop is evaluated next. If a continue statement is executed
in a do-while statement, the Boolean expression at the bottom of the loop is evaluated
next. And if a continue statement is executed inside a for loop, the control is transferred to
the increment expression (incrExpr).
</P>

<P>The syntax of the continue statement is the reserved word continue on a line by
itself with an optional label:
</P>

<PRE>
continue [label];
</PRE>

<P>When the label is used, the loop will continue to the loop that has the label. The
inner loop will restart when it is executed again.
</P>

<P>Consider the following example that uses a continue statement:
</P>

<PRE>
for (int x = 1; x &lt; 999; x++)
{
     y += x*3;
     if  (x == 333)
          continue;

     y += 5;

} // end for
</PRE>

<P>In the previous for loop when the value of x becomes 333, the statement that follows
y
</P>
