<P>statement and the statement-false is called the
else-statement.
</P>

<P>The brackets [ ] around the else part are meta-characters that indicate that the else part
is optional. These meta-characters are not part of the syntax of the if statement. Figure
4.6 shows a logic flow diagram that shows the behavior of the if statement.
</P>

<P>The following are examples of if statements:
</P>

<PRE>
int     x = 11;
int     y = 22;
int     z ;

// if1
if  (x &gt; 0)
    z = 2;
</PRE>

<P>In the preceding if statement, there is no else part. If the expression x &gt; 0 evaluates
to true, the statement z = 2; is executed.
</P>

<P>Consider another example:
</P>

<PRE>
// if2
if (x &lt;= y)
   z = 2;
else
   z = 111;
</PRE>

<P>The preceding example has an else part with single statements that get executed
depending on whether x &lt;= y is true or false. Notice that you can use the conditional operator
?: to write this same logic in an alternate way. The preceding if statement, therefore,
is equivalent to the following single assignment statement:
</P>

<PRE>
z = (x &lt;= y) ? 2 : 11;
</PRE>

<P>The next if statement uses a single block statement that is executed only if the
expression y != 0 is true:
</P>

<PRE>
// if3
if (y != 0)
{
    y *= 10;
    x = 100_x;
}
</PRE>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-87"><P>Page 87</P></A>



<P>Notice that the block statement must be used when you want to execute more than
one statement in the if statement.
</P>

<P>In the following example of an if statement, two block statements are used for each of
the statement-true and statement-false.
</P>

<PRE>
// if4
if (y &lt; 0)
{
    y = x_y;
    x = x + 20;
}
else
{
    x = x + y_20;
    y += 30;
}
</PRE>

<P>In the following example, because there is only one statement in the
statement-true part, a block statement is not used, but for the
statement-false part, a block statement
is used because it consists of more than one statement.
</P>

<PRE>
// if5
if (x_y &gt; 3)
   y = _100;
else
{
   y = _300*x;
   x = _x;
}
</PRE>

<P>The next example is similar to the preceding one. It has only one statement in
the statement-false part, and so a block statement is not used. But in the
statement-true part, a block statement is used because it consists of more than one statement.
</P>

<PRE>
// if6
if (x + y != 100)
{
   z = 100;
   x = z + y;
   y %= 3;
</PRE>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-88"><P>Page 88</P></A>



<PRE>
}
else
   z = _y;
</PRE>

<P>As an issue of style, the author prefers to use compound blocks even if single
statements are in the statement-true and statement-false. The reason for this is that there
is less editing work to do in the code maintenance phase of the program if an
additional statement needs to be added. Another reason is that such a convention makes the
if statements look uniform, and this makes the program more readable. The use of
compound blocks for single statements does not affect the code size in any way. The
author, therefore, would prefer to code the example labeled
&quot;if2,&quot; as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
// if2
if (x &lt;= y)
{
   z = 2;
}
else
{
   z = 111;

} // end if
</PRE>

<P>Notice the use of the comment // end if on the closing brace (}) on the block statement
aids in program readability as it tells you that this is the end of the if statement. This
is particularly valuable in a program that has many nested statements and closing braces.
</P>

<P>Suppose that if the Boolean expression in the if statement evaluates to false, you need
to execute another if statement. You can code this type of if statement by using the
else-if statement. Here is an example:
</P>

<PRE>
if (x == 10)
{
   --x;
}
else if (x == 20)
{
   ++x;

} // end if
</PRE>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-89"><P>Page 89</P></A>



<P>In the preceding example, you want to execute different statements when the value
of x is 10 or 20. In general, situations occur when you want to execute a
multiway decision. The following is the general syntax of coding this multiway decision by
using an if statement:
</P>

<PRE>
if  (booleanExpression1 )
      statement1
else if  (booleanExpression2 )
      statement2
else if  (booleanExpression3 )
      statement3
&#133;
else if  (booleanExpressionN )
      statementN
[else
      statement-last]
</PRE>

<P>The expressions booleanExpression1,
booleanExpression2, and so on are evaluated in the order in which they occur in the if statement. If any of the Boolean
expressions evaluates to true, the corresponding statement is executed, and then execution
transfers to the end of the if statement and the remaining Boolean expressions and statements
are not evaluated. The statementN can be any statement including the block statement.
</P>

<P>The optional else part at the end of the multiway if is executed only if all other
Boolean expressions evaluate to false. The else part, therefore, is used to handle the default
code in statement-last, if no other conditions (Boolean expressions) are satisfied. If there is
no default code, you can leave out the last else part.
</P>

<P>Listing 4.3 shows a program that illustrates the use of the if statement to perform
the following functions:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>          The program reads a character from the screen.
<LI>          If the character that is read is a digit, a message
&quot;A digit was entered&quot; is displayed.
<LI>          If the character that is read is a
not a digit, a message &quot;No valid digit was
entered&quot; is displayed.
</OL>
