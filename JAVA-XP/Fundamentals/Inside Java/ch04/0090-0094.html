<P>Lines 14_23 in listing 4.3 define a Boolean variable that is initally set to false.
These Boolean variables are defined one for each digit, and are set to true, if the
corresponding digit is entered.
</P>

<P>Line 25 defines the character variable, inpCh, that holds the character that was
entered. Line 27 displays a message prompting the user to enter a digit, and line 28 reads the
digit by using the System.in.read() method. This method is similar to the
System.out.println() method that has been used in many of the previous examples, except that it reads a byte
value from the input stream. The System.in.read() method returns an int value, and this is
converted to a character value by using the cast operation (char).
</P>

<P>To support the System.in.read() method, notice the addition of the import statement in line 7:
</P>

<PRE>
import java.io.*;
</PRE>

<P>This statement makes all the class definitions for package java.io available. In
particular, it makes available the class IOException, which is needed in the invocation of
the System.in.read() method. The call to this method can result in an error condition, which
is handled in Java as an exception. An exception in Java signals an event, such as an
error, or an abnormal condition. You can use the exception to transfer control to another
point within the program that is better able to handle the error.
</P>

<P>The specification of the System.in.read() method states that the exception
IOException defined in the java.io package will be signalled or
raised, and you must explicitly handle this. In this case, if an IO exception takes place in the reading of input, the
exception IOException will be raised, and this will cause the termination of the program by
causing the main() to throw the exception. Notice that in line 12, the clause throws IOException
has been added to the main() declaration. This clause informs the Java compiler that it
should not complain about an exception not being explicitly handled within the Java
program, and it is the programmer's intention that the exception will be raised by the
main() program and control be transferred to the caller of the
main() program. This caller of the main() program in this case is the runtime environment that initiated the execution of the
Java progam, and it will cause the termination of the Java program when it sees an
exception. There are certainly more graceful ways to handle an exception, and you will learn
about them in detail in Chapter 11, &quot;Performing Java Input/Output.&quot;

<P>Lines 30_70 contain the multiway if statement that sets the Boolean variable
corresponding to the digit that was entered. Lines 72_82 contain the if statement that generates
the display message, whether a digit or non-digit character was entered.
</P>

<P>Figure 4.7 shows the ouput of this program by using javac when a digit or a non-digit
is entered.

The switch Statement
</A></H4>

<P>A switch statement is a special multiway decision statement. The switch
statement evaluates an expression and executes a group of statements that are labeled by
the expression value. The following example is the general form of a switch statement:
</P>

<PRE>
switch (expression)
      {
case const1:
      {statement;}

case const2:
      {statement;}

&#133;

case constN:
      {statement;}
</PRE>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-94"><P>Page 94</P></A>



<PRE>
[default:
      {statement;}]
}
</PRE>

<P>After expression is evaluated, it is checked to see if it matches any of the
constant values constN on the case label. If the expression matches the constant case value,
the group of statements listed under it as
{statement;} are executed. The {} around
statements are meant as meta-characters and indicate zero or more occurrences of a Java
statement. These meta-characters should not be considered the characters for a block statement.
</P>

<P>At the end of the execution of the last statement in the case statement group,
execution continues on to the statements for the next case label,
unless a break statement is encountered. When a break statement is encountered, execution of further statements
in the switch statement is terminated, and the control is passed to the end of the
switch statement. The break statement is used to exit to the end of the switch
statement. Execution will fall through to the next case label, unless you have a break statement.
</P>

<P>The default label and statements are optional. The statements under the default label
are executed when the expression value does not match any of the case labels. It is
good programming practice to always include the default label because it shows the reader
of the program that you have considered all possible values of the expression. If there is
no default action to perform, you do not have to enter any statements for the default label.
</P>

<P>The case labels and default labels can occur in any order, but the case labels must
all have different values.
</P>

<P>The following is an example of a switch statement:
</P>

<PRE>
int     x;
int     y;
int     z;

// Statements initializing x, y, and z.

switch (x)
{
case 1:
   y++;
