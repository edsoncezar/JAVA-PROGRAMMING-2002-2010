The return Statement
</A></H4>

<P>The return statement is used in methods to exit from the method. It is also used to
return a value from the method that is supposed to return a value. The structure of methods
will be discussed in later chapters, so in this section only the syntax of the return
statement is presented for the sake of completion.
</P>

<P>The following is the  general syntax of the return statement:
</P>

<P>return [&#176;expression];
</P>

<P>The &#176;expression is in brackets, which indicates that the
expression is optional.

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>In this chapter, you learned about the different statement types in Java. The
different statement types enable you to code the logic of a program. The most
fundamental statement types are the assignment and the block statement. If you want to write
logic that depends on test conditions, you need to use control flow statements. You
learned many different types of control flow statements in this chapter such as the if
statement, while statement, do-while statement, switch statement, continue statement, and
break and return statements.
