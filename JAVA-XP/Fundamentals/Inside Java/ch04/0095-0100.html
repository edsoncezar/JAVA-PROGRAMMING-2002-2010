<P>In this switch statement, if the value of x is _1, the following statements are executed:
</P>

<PRE>y++;
z++;
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the statement z++ is also executed because the execution
falls through to the next case statement due to the absence of the break statement.
</P>

<P>If the value of x is 2, the following statement is executed:
</P>

<PRE>
z++;
</PRE>

<P>Notice that execution of further statements for values of x equal to 1 or 2 is
terminated when the break statement is encountered.
</P>

<P>If the value of x is set to 3, the following statement is executed:
</P>

<PRE>
z _= x;
</PRE>

<P>For all other values of x that are not 1, 2, or 3, the following statement is executed:
</P>

<PRE>
y = _9;
</PRE>

<P>Notice that there is a break statement after the last default statement in the switch,
even though it is logically not necessary. This is done in case another case statement is
added at the end of the default statement. The break statement prevents an inadvertent
fall through to the next case statement.

<P>Listing 4.4 shows a program listing of the same program in listing 4.3, but uses a
switch statement for the multiway decision. Note that the multiway if statement has
been

The while Statement
</A></H4>

<P>The while statement is the basic statement that is used for creating a loop.
Most programs need to perform some form of repeated action, and the while
statement provides a nice solution for performing this repeated action.
</P>

<P>The general syntax of the while statement is as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
while (booleanExpression)

      statement
</PRE>

<P>The booleanExpression is evaluated at the beginning of each loop execution. If
this expression evaluates to a true, the statement is executed. This
statement is any Java statement including the block statement. At the end of the
statement execution, control is transferred to the top of the loop where
booleanExpression is evaluated again. If the evaluation yields a true result, the
statement is executed again. So as long as the
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-99"><P>Page 99</P></A>



<P>booleanExpression evaluates to true, the
statement is executed, and this implements a loop. The loop terminates only when
booleanExpression evaluates to a false. When the loop terminates, control is transferred to the end of the while loop.
</P>

<P>Figure 4.8 shows the logic diagram of a while statement.
</P>

Figure 4.8
Logic flow diagram for a while statement.<BR>
</P>

<P>Consider the following example of a while statement:
</P>

<PRE>
short    x = 0;
short    max = 40;
double   y = 100000000.0;
double   z = 2.0;

while (x++ &lt; max)
{
      y = Math.sqrt(y);
      z = Math.exp((double)x);
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-100"><P>Page 100</P></A>


<PRE>
      System.out.println(&quot;y = &quot;+y);
      System.out.println(&quot;exp(&quot;+x+&quot;) = &quot;+z);

} // end while
</PRE>

<P>This while statement will execute until the expression x++ &lt; max becomes false. This
will happen when the value of x before the postfix increment is 40. Within the while loop,
the value of x will range from 1 to 40. The loop will successively take the square root of
a large number 100000000.0 and display the results. Additionally, the loop takes
the exponent of values of variable x, and displays the results.
</P>

<P>Consider another example of a while statement that is often useful:
</P>

<PRE>
while (true)
{
      // Statements

} // end while
</PRE>

<P>At first sight, this type of while statement may appear strange because you are
testing for the constant true in the Boolean expression part of the while statement. Clearly
such a test will never evaluate to false, and therefore the loop will continue
indefinitely. Actually, this is the precisely the point of this while statement&#151;it sets up an
indefinite loop. The indefinite loop is useful for setting up background processes and
&quot;server&quot; processes that need to be running all the time. These processes could perform
repeated polling action. An example of a server process would be a printer server process,
running on a computer with several printers attached to the computer. This print server
process would loop indefinitely listening for print requests from other computers.
</P>

<P>There is actually even a better way of setting up an indefinite loop. You will learn
more about this in the next section on for statements.
</P>

<P>Listing 4.5 shows a program that uses a while statement to loop through a sequence
of input characters and print a classification of the characters that were supplied on
input, based on the following:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>          The number of total characters that were read from the input stream.
<LI>          The number of digits.
<LI>          The number of white space characters, such as blanks, newlines, and tabs.
<LI>          The loop terminates on a non-digit or non-whitespace character. The
character causing the loop termination is displayed.
</OL>
