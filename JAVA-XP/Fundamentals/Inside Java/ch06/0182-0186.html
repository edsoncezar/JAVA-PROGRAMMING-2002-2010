<PRE>
   Room     rm1;
   Room     rm2;
</PRE>


<P>These statements define two instances of the Room class. Each of the objects
rm1 and rm2 are shown in figure 6.2. Each of the class variables are called instance variables.
The class instance variables are referenced by using the following syntax:
</P>

<P><I>    instanceobject.variablename</I>
</P>

<P>The <I>instanceobject </I>is the name of the class object, such as rm1 or rm2.
The <I>variablename</I> is the name of the class variable defined inside the class. The
following are examples of referencing class instance variables:
</P>

<PRE>
rm1.maxRooms
rm2.maxRooms
rm1.area
rm2.area
</PRE>

</P>

<P>The class instance variables rm1.maxRooms and
rm2.maxRooms have values that are specific to each object instance. The class instance variables occupy different
memory and can have different values. For example,
rm1.maxRooms can be set to a value of 1, and
rm2.maxRooms can be set to a value of 3.

Defining Class Variables
</A></H4>

<P>As you learned in the previous section, class instance variables for separate
objects have a separate existence. A class variable or a class wide variable, on the other hand,
is common for all class instances. These class variables are preceded with the
reserved word static:
</P>


<PRE>
static type variable = [initialize_value];
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-183"><P>Page 183</P></A>



<P>Suppose that you want to keep track of the number of times a room has been
occupied, and also track the number of times repairs were done to the room. You cannot
1effectively use instance variables to keep track of these values because instance variables
are defined for a particular class instance only, and you need global counters for all
class instances.
</P>

<P>Consider an extension to the class Room:
</P>


<PRE>
class Room
{
      // Class instance variables
      int maxRooms;
      int entranceType;
      float area;
      boolean bathroom;


      // Class variables
      static int nOccupancies;
      static int nRepairs = 0;

      // Other variables.

      // Other methods

}
</PRE>


<P>The variables nOccupancies and nRepairs are class variables because they are
preceded by the reserved word static. Both variables are of type
int, but one of them (nRepairs) has an initial value of 0. The variable
nOccupancies is used to keep track of the number of times the room has been occupied, and the variable
nRepairs is used to keep track of the number of repairs to the room.
</P>

<P>Consider the two instances rm1, rm2 of the previous class. How would you reference
the variables nOccupancies and nRepairs? You cannot reference them by using the
following syntax:
</P>


<PRE>
rm1.nOccupancies
rm2.nRepairs
</PRE>


<P>This attempt to reference the class variables is incorrect, because the class variables
are common to all instances of the class. Figure 6.3 shows the difference in storage space
for class instance and class variables.
</P>

<I>Class instance and class variables.</I>
</P>

<P>To correctly reference class variables, you must use the following syntax:
</P>

<P><I>classname.variablename</I>
</P>

<P>Therefore to reference the class variable
nOccupancies and nRepairs, you must use the following syntax:
</P>


<PRE>
Room.nOccupancies
Room.nRepairs
</PRE>


<P>Because the data area storage for class variables is the same for all class
instances, changing a class variable will change it for all class instances.
</P>

Class Constants
</A></H4>

<P>Suppose that you want to define an integer array of size 312. You can use a
constant literal to specify the size of the array:
</P>

<PRE>
int[] xa = new int[312];
</PRE>

<P>But this is not always good programming practice because the constant values (312
in the preceding example) appear to be like &quot;magic numbers,&quot; and it is harder to
figure out why a particular constant value is used. For this reason, a variable name that is to
be treated as a constant is generally preferred. When defined within a class, these
constants are called class constants. If, for example, the array size was defined by
the constant MAX_SIZE with value 312, you could write the preceding array definition as
the following:
</P>

<PRE>
int[] xa = new int[MAX_SIZE];
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-185"><P>Page 185</P></A>



<P>The preceding statement is not only more readable, but does not raise the question,
as did the first version of this statement, as to why a value of 312 was used. You can
more readily tell that the value 312 is the maximum size of the array.
</P>

<P>You could define MAX_SIZE as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
int MAX_SIZE = 312;
</PRE>

<P>In this definition, however, MAX_SIZE is a variable whose value can be accessed
and changed within the program&#151;it is not really a constant. Java enables you to
define symbolic constants or named constants called
<I>class constants</I>, which can be referred to by an identifier by using the following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>
final type variable = initialize_value;
</PRE>

<P>The class constant definition is similar to a class variable definition with the exception
of the reserved word final preceding the definition. The reserved word final indicates
that the value assigned by <I>initialize_value</I> is the final value (constant value), and it
cannot be changed. Any attempt to change the value of the class constant will generate
a syntax error when the program is compiled. Thus,
MAX_SIZE could be defined as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
final int MAX_SIZE = 312;
</PRE>

<P>Here is an example of the use of class constants:
</P>
<PRE>
class ConstClass
{
      final int MAX_STUDENTS = 100;

      public void Ex1()
      {
         int[] grades = new int[MAX_STUDENTS];

         for (int x = 0; x &lt; MAX_STUDENTS; x++)
      {
            grades[x] = 0;

         } // end for

         } // end Ex1

} // end ConstClass
</PRE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-186"><P>Page 186</P></A>



<P>Notice that the class constant MAX_STUDENTS was defined in the class and outside
a method. Could you have placed the definition of
MAX_STUDENTS inside the method Ex1? The answer is no. This is not a severe limitation, as it may first seem,
because methods always occur inside classes, and a class constant defined in a class is
accessible by all methods in the class (see fig. 6.4).<BR>

Implementing Class Methods
</A></H3>

<P>Most of the logic for classes is contained in the class methods. The class variables
are also important to define because they describe the data structures that are used in
the class methods, but the behavior of the class is contained in the class methods.
</P>

<P>When you implement classes, you will spend most of the time defining the methods
and implementing their logic. The following sections focus on different aspects of
defining class methods.
</P>

Defining Class Methods
</A></H4>

<P>You have seen examples of several class methods already in this book. The
most common example you have seen in the previous chapters has been the
main() method, which must be defined for all Java applications that are to run stand-alone without
the help of a Web browser.
