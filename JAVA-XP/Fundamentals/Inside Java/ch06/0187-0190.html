<P>All methods have the following components (see fig. 6.5):
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     The name of the method
<LI>     The type of data returned by this method
<LI>     The parameter for the method
<LI>     The body of the method
</UL>

<I>Method components.</I>
</P>

<P>The following is the general syntax of a method:
</P>
<PRE>
qualifiers return_type methodname( type1 param1, type2 param2, ... )
{
      ...

}
</PRE>

<P>The <I>qualifiers</I> are reserved words such as
public, static, and so on. The <I>qualifiers</I>
are optional and control how the method is used or accessed by other Java program code.
</P>

<P>The <I>return_type</I> is the data type of the value returned by the method. The
<I>return_type</I> can be a Java basic type (such as
int, char, float, and so on), or it can be a class name,
or the reserved word void. If the reserved word
void is used, it indicates that no value is returned by the method.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-188"><P>Page 188</P></A>



<P>If the method has to return an array of values, such as an array of integers, it can
be written in either of the following forms:
</P>

<PRE>
int[] methodname(parameters)
{
      ...
}
</PRE>

<P>or
</P>

<PRE>
int methodname(parameters)[]
{
      ...
}
</PRE>

<P>The first method is more intuitive and easier to understand, and for this reason it is
the preferred form.
</P>

<P>If a <I>return_type</I> is not void, you must have at least one return statement of the
following type:
</P>
<PRE>
return expression;
</PRE>

<P>The data type of the return expression must match the
<I>return_type</I> of the method. If the
<I>return_type</I> is void, you do not have to use a return statement. The method will
exit when its last statement is executed. If you need to terminate a void type method
before its last statement, you can use the return statement without the expression:
</P>
<PRE>
return;
</PRE>

<P>The parameters<I> </I>are optional and are used to pass data to the method. If the method
doesn't have any parameters, you write the method with an empty list of parentheses ():
</P>
<PRE>
void methodname()
{
      ...
}
</PRE>

<P>The parameter list is a set of variable declarations separated by commas. Writing
these parameters is similar to writing class variables or local variables, except that you
must use commas to separate them, instead of semicolons. The parameters act as
placeholders for the actual parameter value that is passed to the method. The parameters to
the method are also called <I>arguments</I>. The parameters are also treated as local
variables inside the body of the method.
</P>

<P>The body of the method can contain any valid statement and expressions, such
as variable and object definitions, assignment statements, and conditional statements,
such as for, while, do-while, if, switch, and so on.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-189"><P>Page 189</P></A>



<P>The <I>methodname</I> is the name of the method, and it is any valid Java identifier.
An identifier in Java can be a sequence of unicode characters of
<I>any</I> length. For practical reasons, you may not want to abuse this lack of limitation in the length of an
identifier. Defining a method, for example, whose name is 500 characters will not only make
the program difficult to create, but also create significant difficulties for anyone who is
trying to understand and modify the program. The characters that you can use to create
the identifier are limited. A Java identifier must begin with a letter, followed by any
combination of letters and digits. A letter is a set consisting of letters a_z, A_Z, and the
underscore (_) and dollar ($) characters.
</P>

<P>Methods within a class can call each other by using the method name followed by a
list of argument values that match the number and type of parameters for the method
being called. Java code that is outside the class, in another method, must use an object name
or class name reference for calling the method:
</P>

<PRE>
reference.methodname(parameters);
</PRE>

<P>The <I>reference </I>is the object name or class name (for static methods). The
<I>methodname </I>is the name of the method that is being called, and
<I>parameters</I> is a list of argument values with which the method is being called.
</P>

<P>

<B>On the
CD</B><BR>
The program in listing 6.1 shows an example of the use of calling method names
from within a class and outside a class. This program is the SortArray program discussed
in Chapter 5, &quot;Using Java Objects and Arrays,&quot; but it is written as two separate
classes instead of one single class. The program is in the file MethodCalls.java in the
CD-ROM that accompanies this book. Figure 6.6 shows the classes and methods that you can
use to quickly examine the structure of the program. From this figure, you can see that
the program consists of two classes MethodCalls and
ArraySort2. The MethodCalls class contains the method
main(), and the ArraySort2 class contains the methods
sort(), orderOK(), and print().
</P>

<P>Lines 10_55 in listing 6.1 contain the
MethodCalls class, and lines 57_146 contain the
ArraySort2 class. Lines 47_50 contain the following statements:
</P>

<PRE>
ArraySort2.sort(sortAscending, ya);
        ArraySort2.print(sortAscending ?
                 &quot;Ascending order&quot;:
                 &quot;Descending order&quot;, ya);
</PRE>

<P>Notice that the methods sort() and print() are static methods in an another
class ArraySort2. To invoke these methods from the
MethodCalls, you have to precede them with a reference to their class name,
ArraySort2.
</P>

<P>Within the method sort() in class ArraySort2, on line 78, a call is made to another
method orderOK() in the same class. Because orderOK() is in the same class as the method
that calls it, there is no need to precede this by the reference to the class name.
