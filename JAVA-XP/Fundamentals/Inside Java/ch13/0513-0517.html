The New, Improved <BR>

ers

</H2>

<P><b>P</b>revious chapters detailed how to use Java's built-in graphic 
primitives to produce lines, shapes, images, and sounds. These 
primitives are included in the Java AWT (Abstract
Window Toolkit, known as the Alternate Windowing Toolkit or Another
Window Toolkit).
</P>

<P>The Java AWT is a toolkit used to build applications. It is called
abstract because the Java AWT enables the developer to write code to the
AWT standard, and it is implemented by the underlying
<I>windowing system</I> of the execution platform. A windowing system is the part of a
platform's operating system that manages windows, GUI components, and
events&#151;like mouse-button clicks.
</P>

<P>In this chapter and in Chapter 14, &quot;The New, Improved AWT:
Menus, Events, and More New Features,&quot; you will learn how to use the AWT
to build Java programs that have GUI (Graphical User Interface)
components such as buttons, menus, and text fields. Version 1.1 of the JDK
(Java

 Development Kit), developed by Sun, introduced many additions and changes to
the AWT from version 1.0.2. For this reason, these chapters will focus more on the
additions and changes than those features that remain constant. The JDK contains tools and
Java class libraries for developing Java applets and applications.
</P>

<P>This chapter covers the following basic building blocks of the Java AWT:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Components, such as buttons and check boxes
<LI>          Containers, which contain the components on the screen
<LI>          Layout managers, which organize the layout of components within a container
</UL>

Using AWT Components
</A></H3>

<P>AWT components are GUI elements (buttons, menus, and text fields for example)
and can be used in any Java applet or application. All components are part of the
java.awt package and are derived from the java.awt.Component class. Figure 13.1 illustrates
the hierarchy of classes derived from the Component class. Take some time to examine
this figure, because it will be referred to throughout this chapter.

<A NAME="PAGENUM-515"><P>Page 515</P></A>




<P>In this hierarchy, the Component class contains by far the most methods. As with
any class hierarchy, these methods are inherited by the derived classes. The
setEnable() method, for example, (which is defined in the Component class) lets you either enable
or disable a button, or any other GUI component in the hierarchy. The following
section details the use of GUI elements in a simple Java program.

<P>Listing 13.1, which is the program HelloGuiWorld.java on the CD-ROM
accompanying this book, depicts an applet that serves as a simple example of how you can use
GUI components in a Java program. Figure 13.2 displays this applet's user interface,
which consists of a button and a label. When you click the button, the label displays
&quot;Hello GUI World!&quot;; when you click the button again, the label displays &quot;Goodbye!&quot;.

<P>Lines 15 and 16 in listing 13.1 declare references to the objects of type Button and
Label, which are named pushButton and
greetingLabel, respectively. These instance
variables manipulate the button and label GUI components that appear in the applet.
</P>

<P>Line 25 creates the object to which pushButton refers. This form of the Button
constructor takes one parameter&#151;in this case the String &quot;Push&quot;&#151;that appears on the face of
the Button.
</P>

<P>Similarly, line 36 creates the object to which
greetingLabel refers. This form of the Label constructor takes one parameter as well, which is the text that appears on the label.
The add() method in lines 26 and 37 adds the GUI components to the applet's display.

If you have written Java programs prior to JDK 1.1, you may be unfamiliar with
the addActionListener() method in line 32 and the
actionPerformed() method in line 41. These methods are part of a new event model, known as the Delegation Event Model, which
is the preferred way of handling events. Using the
addActionListener() method, the button registers an event &quot;listener.&quot; When the event that is listened for occurs, the
appropriate method in the listener is called&#151;in this case, the
actionPerformed() method. Chapter 14 will discuss the Delegation Event Model in more detail.

<P>The getText() method in line 42 returns a String that contains the text currently
displayed on the label. The setText() methods in lines 43 and 46 take a String as a parameter
holding the text to be displayed in the label.
