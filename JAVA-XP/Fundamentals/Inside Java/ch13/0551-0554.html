containers, such as panels, frames, and dialog boxes, without having to make
assumptions about component and container sizes.
</P>
<P>The Java AWT has five layout managers, each of which can implement
the LayoutManager interface. The following list organizes these layout managers
from simplest to most complex:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          FlowLayout
<LI>          BorderLayout
<LI>          CardLayout
<LI>          GridLayout
<LI>          GridBagLayout
</UL>

<P>Other layout managers are available from Java component vendors and Java Web
sites. You also can create your own layout managers.
</P>

<P>One or more layout managers can be used to lay out a container. This is
because containers can hold other containers, and each of these containers can have a
different layout manager. Table 13.17 describes some characteristics of each AWT
layout manager.

</TD><TD>
Characteristics
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
FlowLayout
</TD><TD>
Easy to use. Adds new components from left to<BR>
right within the container. Sometimes used to <BR>
lay out a row of components in a Panel that <BR>
is contained by a larger container.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
BorderLayout
</TD><TD>
Easy to use. Has five areas in which to place
components: North, South, East, West, and Center. Good
for laying out dialog boxes that have buttons across
the bottom. In this case, the Center area usually contains
a Panel with another layout manager. Also good for &quot;quick and dirty&quot; applets.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
CardLayout
</TD><TD>
A little harder than the previous two. One &quot;card&quot;
(which can contain a component or container) is shown at
a time. Can be used for implementing
notebook-style (tabbed pages) functionality.

GridLayout
</TD><TD>
Also a little harder to use than the first two. Divides
the container into a matrix of rows and columns, with
each cell identical in size. Great for implementing
metaphors that look like grids, such as a calendar page, a
battleship game, or a touch-tone pad. Too restrictive to lay out
a complex container, but good for laying out a sub-container, such as a column of buttons on the East
side of a BorderLayout.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
GridBagLayout
</TD><TD>
The mother of all AWT layout managers. Can be a
little difficult to use initially. Divides the container into a
grid of cells that don't have to be the same size.
Also, components can span cells. Uses <BR>
GridBagConstraints associated with each component
to specify how it is to be laid out. Good for laying
out complex containers, often with the help of
FlowLayout and GridLayout for sub-containers.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Now that we introduced the Java AWT layout managers, let's examine each one in
more detail.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch13_ 17">
FlowLayout
</A></H4>

<P>Some examples that you have already seen in this chapter use FlowLayout to lay
out components. Take another look at listing 13.1 (the HelloGuiWorld applet) and
the associated display in figure 13.2. This applet creates a button and a label, and adds
them to the applet's display. Recall that the Applet class is derived from the Panel class;
the default layout manager for a Panel is FlowLayout. Therefore, because no layout
manager is specified for the HelloGuiWorld applet, the default is FlowLayout.
</P>

<P>Recapping listing 13.1, the button is created and added to the applet in lines 25 <BR>
and 26:
</P>
<PRE>

25           pushButton = new Button(&quot;Push&quot;);
26           add(pushButton);
</PRE>

<P>Lines 36 and 37 create and add the label to the applet:
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-553"><P>Page 553</P></A>


<PRE>
36           greetingLabel = new Label(helloString);
37           add(greetingLabel);
</PRE>

<P>As you can see, you simply call the add() method of the container to which you
are adding the component. Because the FlowLayout layout manager has been
(implicitly) set, it takes over the job of laying out the components. To explicitly set the
layout manager of a container to FlowLayout, use the
setLayout() method of the container with one of the following forms of the FlowLayout constructor:
</P>
<PRE>
setLayout(new FlowLayout(int align, int hgap, int vgap));
setLayout(new FlowLayout(int align));
setLayout(new FlowLayout());
</PRE>

<P>The first form of the constructor takes three parameters:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Alignment (can be LEFT, RIGHT, or CENTER). This controls where
components will be added. If the components added exceed the width of the container, they
will be added below the first row, using the specified alignment.
<LI>          Horizontal gap between components in pixels.
<LI>          Vertical gap between components in pixels.
</UL>

<P>The second form takes only the alignment parameter and defaults to horizontal
and vertical gaps of five pixels.
</P>

<P>The third form defaults to CENTER alignment and gaps of five pixels.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch13_ 18">
BorderLayout
</A></H4>

<P>For a good example of BorderLayout, look at listing 13.2 (the ScrollbarSlider applet)
and the associated display in figure 13.5. BorderLayout is used in line 36 to stretch
a Scrollbar (instance variable named slider) across the bottom of the applet:
</P>
<PRE>
36           add(&quot;South&quot;, slider);
</PRE>

<P>In lines 44_46, a Panel is added to the center area of the applet so that a
TextField (instance variable named value) can be added to the Panel and displayed:
</P>
<PRE>
44           Panel p = new Panel();
45           add(&quot;Center&quot;, p);
46           p.add(value);
</PRE>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-554"><P>Page 554</P></A>



<P>If the text field had been added directly to the container in line 45, it would
have stretched to fit the entire center area. The diagram in figure 13.10 shows the areas
to which components can be added.
</P>

Figure 13.10
<I>Diagram of BorderLayout areas.</I>
</P>

<P>To add a component to a container that is governed by a BorderLayout, use the
following form of the container's add() method:
</P>
<PRE>
add(String name, Component comp)
</PRE>

<P>The String in this case is either &quot;North,&quot; &quot;South,&quot; &quot;East,&quot; &quot;West,&quot; or &quot;Center.&quot;
The Component is the component that you want to add to the container. The component
will be stretched horizontally if added to the North or South, or vertically if added to the
East or West. The component will be stretched both horizontally and vertically to fill
the remaining space if added to the Center area.
</P>

<P>To set the layout of a container to BorderLayout, use the
setLayout() method of the container with one of the following forms of the BorderLayout constructor:
</P>
<PRE>
setLayout(new BorderLayout(int hgap, int vgap));
setLayout(new BorderLayout());
</PRE>

<P>The first form of the constructor takes two parameters: the horizontal gap and the
vertical gap (in pixels) that will be placed between components.
</P>

<P>The second form uses default values of zero for these gaps.
</P>
