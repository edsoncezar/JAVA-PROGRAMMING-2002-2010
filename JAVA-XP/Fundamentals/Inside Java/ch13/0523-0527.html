<P>As you have seen, the List component displays a list of choices to the user.
Another component, called the Choice component, also presents a set of choices, although in
a slightly different manner, as the following section details.

Choice Components
</A></H4>

<P>A Choice&#151;commonly referred to as a drop-down list&#151;is similar to a List, except that
the Choice component is displayed as only one line of text. When the user clicks
this component, the list of choices drops down. Unlike a List, a Choice can accept only
one selection at a time. The following example creates a Choice with the days of the week:
</P>
<PRE>
Choice days = new Choice();
days.add(&quot;Sunday&quot;);
days.add(&quot;Monday&quot;);
days.add(&quot;Tuesday&quot;);
days.add(&quot;Wednesday&quot;);
days.add(&quot;Thursday&quot;);
days.add(&quot;Friday&quot;);
days.add(&quot;Saturday&quot;);
add(days);

<P>The components that you've seen so far are typically operated upon by clicking
the mouse and making choices. The next two components enable the user to input text
and numbers into your applications.

TextField and TextArea Components
</A></H4>

<P>The TextField and TextArea classes are used to display and receive text input from
the user. The main difference between the two is that a TextField has one line of
text, whereas TextArea can have multiple lines. As shown earlier in this chapter in figure
13.1, both classes are derived from the TextComponent class and share many of the
same methods. The following example creates a TextField that is 20 columns wide and
contains the words &quot;Change me!&quot;. This example also creates an empty TextArea that is
20 columns wide and four rows high.
</P>
<PRE>
TextField tf = new TextField(&quot;Change me!&quot;, 20);
TextArea ta = new TextArea(null, 4, 20);
add(tf);
add(ta);
</PRE>

<P>Because the TextField and TextArea classes are derived from the TextComponent
class, some methods used with the TextField and TextArea components are defined
there. Table 13.7 lists some commonly used methods defined in the TextComponent class. For
a complete list, refer to the following Web page:

This section discussed the text-oriented components. The following section
explores another important component: the Scrollbar.

The ScrollBar Component
</A></H4>

<P>Scrollbars usually are used in conjunction with an area to be scrolled.
Sometimes, however, a scrollbar can be used as a &quot;slider&quot; to enable the user to input a value.

<B>Figure 13.4</B>
<I>Scrollbar elements and properties.</I>
</P>

<P>figure 13.4 illustrates, scrollbars can be horizontal or vertical. This figure also
shows some properties associated with scrollbars.
</P>

<P>A scrollbar has the following properties:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Orientation: A scrollbar can be either horizontal or vertical.
<LI>          Maximum: This property represents the highest value that the scrollbar
can represent.
<LI>          Minimum: This property represents the lowest value that the scrollbar can
represent.
<LI>          Value: This property is the current value represented by the scrollbar.
<LI>          Visible Amount: When used in conjunction with an area to be scrolled, the size
of the bubble in the scrollbar should be proportional to the visible area of
the document being scrolled.
<LI>          Unit Increment: This property refers to the amount that the value will be
increased when the user clicks the right or top arrow.
<LI>          Block Increment: This property refers to the amount that the value will be
increased when the user clicks the area between the bubble and the right or top arrow.
</UL>

<P>You can get and set these properties by using the get and set methods associated
with each property. Use the setVisibleAmount() method, for example, to set the visible
amount. The adjustable interface, which the Scrollbar class implements, defines all these methods.
