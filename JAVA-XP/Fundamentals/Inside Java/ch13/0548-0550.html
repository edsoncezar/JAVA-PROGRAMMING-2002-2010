<P>The preceding examples and tables assume that a Frame reference exists to pass to
the Dialog and FileDialog constructors. The following section deals with the use of
the Dialog class in applets that don't use Frames.
</P>

<P><B>Using Dialogs with Applets
</P></B>

<P>Dialogs always require a Frame to own them, so how can you implement dialog
boxes with applets that don't have Frames? One option is to cheat a little by using a
Frame instead of a Dialog. The drawback to this, however, is that Frames can't be modal,
so you lose the capability to make the user respond before continuing. In addition,
the applet sometimes can obscure the Frame.
</P>

<P>To solve this problem, get a reference to the Frame within which the applet itself
is running. Whether the applet runs in Applet Viewer or a browser, a call to
getParent() from within the applet should return a reference to a Frame. You then can pass this
reference when creating the Dialog.
</P>

<P>This section has discussed the different types of Dialogs and how to use them.
The following section covers the last type of container, Frame.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch13_ 15">
Frame Class
</A></H4>

<P>A Frame is similar to a Dialog, and both are derived from the Window class. As with
the Dialog, a Frame has a title, a border, and sometimes a menu. Unlike the Dialog,
however, a Frame cannot be modal and is not owned by another AWT component. Essentially,
a Frame is a top-level window.
</P>

<P>Frames are commonly employed as the main window for an application. In this role,
they often have a menu, a toolbar, and a status bar. Unfortunately, the AWT does
not provide the latter two, so you must either obtain them from a Java component vendor
or build them yourself.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-549"><P>Page 549</P></A>



<P>In a document-centric application, the Frame is often where the document is
displayed and operated upon. In a word processing application, for example, your
document usually appears in the main window, which is where you make changes to it.
Your document is the main focus of the application, and all GUI components that you
interact with (such as dialog boxes, toolbar buttons, and menus) exist for the purpose of
manipulating your document. Sometimes multiple documents are associated with an
application, so there may be one Frame for each active document.

The use of the term &quot;document&quot; in this context can apply to any data, such as
a spreadsheet, a picture, your schedule, or your checkbook register.

</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<P>Frames can be created by an applet, but as stated earlier in this chapter, dialog
boxes usually provide a better choice because of modality. Java stand-alone applications
that have a GUI, however, must have a Frame as the top-level window.
</P>

<P>The following line creates a new Frame with title &quot;Example Frame.&quot;
</P>
<PRE>
Frame exampleFrame = new Frame(&quot;Example Frame&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>Although you certainly can create an instance of a Frame, frames typically
are subclassed to override and add methods, as in the following example:
</P>
<PRE>pu
blic class MyFrame extends Frame{
    public MyFrame(String title) {
        super(title);
    }
}
</PRE>

<P>As Chapter 7, &quot;Object-Oriented Programming with Java&quot; discussed, the
super() method in the third line calls the constructor of the superclass, which in this case is Frame.
This causes the title to appear in the title bar of the frame.
</P>

<P>The following code creates an instance of
MyFrame and displays it. The call to setVisible()
is necessary because frames are initially invisible by default:
</P>
<PRE>
MyFrame frm = new MyFrame(&quot;My Frame&quot;);
frm.setSize(200, 200);
frm.setVisible(true);
</PRE>

<P>Table 13.16 contains some frequently used Frame methods. For a complete list, refer

<P>
At this point, we have discussed all AWT components and containers. The
following section introduces layout managers and how to use them to organize the GUI portion
of your Java programs.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch13_ 16">
Using Layout Managers
</A></H3>

<P>Java applets and applications can run on virtually any platform. A Java applet,
for example, can run in any Java-enabled Web browser, and on any operating system
in which the Java VM has been ported. This is one of the exciting and attractive features
of Java. It is important, however, that your application's GUI looks good and functions
well on any platform on which it is executed.
</P>

<P>One of the difficulties in achieving this goal is that GUI components are not the
same size on all supported platforms. For this reason, absolute positioning of GUI
components is not recommended. This is one of the major reasons that the Java AWT has a
feature known as layout managers. Layout managers help you position components
within
