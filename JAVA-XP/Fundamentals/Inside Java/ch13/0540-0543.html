<P>ScrollPane constructor takes an int as a parameter, which can be any one of the
following final static variables:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          SCROLLBARS_ALWAYS&#151;This variable places horizontal and vertical
scrollbars in the ScrollPane, regardless of whether the child component is larger than
the viewport.
<LI>          SCROLLBARS_AS_NEEDED&#151;This variable places a scrollbar in the
ScrollPane only when a dimension of the child component is larger than the viewport. If,
for example, the dimensions of the viewport are 200 pixels wide by 300 pixels high
and the child component is 150 pixels wide by 600 pixels high, then only the
vertical scrollbar would appear in the ScrollPane.
<LI>          SCROLLBARS_NEVER&#151;Scrollbars will not appear in the ScrollPane. In this
case, the only way to scroll is from the program, by using the
setScrollPosition() method.
</UL>

<P>In the NoScrollPain example, scrollbars will only appear when needed&#151;which is
always, because both dimensions of the child component are larger than the
corresponding viewport dimensions.
</P>

<P>Next, in lines 26_32, the unit increment and block increment values are set for
the horizontal and vertical scrollbars. Because the scrollbars are encapsulated within
the ScrollPane, methods of the ScrollPane class must be called to obtain a reference to
them. The getHAdjustable() method returns a reference to the horizontal scrollbar, and
the getVAdjustable() method returns a reference to the vertical scrollbar. As you recall
from previous sections in this chapter, scrollbars implement the adjustable
interface&#151;hence the getHAdjustable() and
getVAdjustable() method names.
</P>
<P>In lines 35 and 39, the BorderLayout is used so that the viewer (an instance of
ScrollPane)
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-541"><P>Page 541</P></A>



<P>occupies the entire applet display area, as shown in figure 13.7.
</P>
<P>Line 41 creates a new instance of the Map, named map, and line 42 adds map to
the viewer (the child component to the ScrollPane). Internally, the ScrollPane now can
ask the child component for its size and can display its scrollbars appropriately, with
proper bubble sizes.

<P>As you can see, the ScrollPane class makes it very easy to implement scrolling areas.
</P>

<P>The containers discussed thus far are displayed within other containers. The rest of
the containers appear in their own window, and consequently are inherited from the
Window class (see fig. 13.1). The Dialog class is the first class to be explored.

<H4><A NAME="ch13_ 14">
Dialog Class
</A></H4>

<P>Dialogs, commonly referred to as dialog boxes, generally are used to display and
gather information from the user. Dialog boxes can be used in many different ways:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Message boxes
<LI>          Property sheets
<LI>          General user input dialog boxes
<LI>          FileDialog, and other common dialog boxes
</UL>

<P>The following sections discuss each one in more detail.
</P>

<P><B>Message Boxes
</P></B>

<P>Message boxes are special purpose dialog boxes that give the user some information
and then wait until the user responds to the information. When, for example, you try to exit
a program without saving your work, a message box may ask, &quot;Exit without
saving?&quot;. Three buttons appear on the message box with choices such as &quot;Yes, &quot;No,&quot;
and &quot;Cancel.&quot; Message boxes usually are modal, which means that you must respond
to them before you can interact with the rest of the application.
</P>

<P>The following code fragment builds the user interface of the message box
described
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-543"><P>Page 543</P></A>




<P>above:
</P>

<PRE>
Dialog msgDialog = new Dialog(this, &quot;My Application&quot;, true);
Panel messagePanel = new Panel();
messagePanel.add(new Label(&quot;Exit without saving?&quot;));
msgDialog.add(&quot;Center&quot;, messagePanel);
Panel buttonPanel = new Panel();
buttonPanel.add(new Button(&quot;Yes&quot;));
buttonPanel.add(new Button(&quot;No&quot;));
buttonPanel.add(new Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;));
msgDialog.add(&quot;South&quot;, buttonPanel);
msgDialog.setSize(300, 150);
msgDialog.show();
</PRE>

<P>The following steps detail the creation of this message box.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>          Create the Dialog:
</OL>
<PRE>
          Dialog msgDialog = new Dialog(this, &quot;My Application&quot;, true);
</PRE>

<OL START="2">
<P>          This first line creates the Dialog, passing it three parameters:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>                  <B>The Frame that owns the dialog
box.</B> All dialog boxes are owned by a Frame, which is usually the main Frame of the application.
<LI>                  <B>A String for the title bar of the dialog
box.</B> Frequently, developers put the name of the application in the title bar, so that when the message
box appears, the user knows from which application it came.
<LI>                  <B>The desired
modality.</B> If true, the dialog box blocks the user from
<LI>interacting with the rest of the application until the user has dealt with it.
</UL>

<LI>          Create a Panel in which to put the &quot;Exit without saving?&quot; message, add the
message to the Panel, and then add the Panel to the &quot;Center&quot; area of the Dialog:
</OL>
<PRE>
Panel messagePanel = new Panel();
messagePanel.add(new Label(&quot;Exit without saving?&quot;));
msgDialog.add(&quot;Center&quot;, messagePanel);
