<P><B>gridx and gridy
</P></B>

<P>Lines 20 and 21 set the gridx and gridy constraints in the GridBagConstraints
instance. This positions the Label component in the first column (gridx) and the first row
(gridy). Please examine the other lines that set gridx and gridy (such as lines <BR>
33 and 34), and also study the corresponding components in figure 13.13.
</P>
<P>Another value for gridx and gridy is RELATIVE. This causes the component to be
added directly below (for gridy) or to the right of the component that was most recently
added (for gridx).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that the top row is row 1 in this case. This row also could have been referred to
as 0 with the same results. Because no rows are referred to as 0, GridBagLayout puts
row 1 at the top. The same holds true for other rows and columns. If, for example, column
7 has no components added to it, GridBagLayout will not provide any space for
that column.

<P><B>gridwidth and gridheight
</P></B>

<P>Gridwidth specifies the number of cells in a row that the component's display area
will occupy.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-572"><P>Page 572</P></A>




<P>Lines 22 and 23 set the gridwidth and gridheight to one column and one row (which
is the default). Note that in this example, most of the constraints are set for each
component, so it's easy to tell which constraint values are being set.
</P>

<P>Line 35 sets gridwidth to two, which causes the display area to take up two cells in
the row. Examine the corresponding Choice component in figure 13.13.
</P>

<P>Lines 184 and 185 set both gridwidth and gridheight of the preview component to
three (see lines 218_231 for the Preview class.) Again, look at figure 13.13 to see the effect
of this.
</P>

<P>Two other possible values exist for gridwidth and gridheight:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          REMAINDER specifies that this component will be the last one in its row
or column, respectively, so it will use the rest of the cells for its display area.
<LI>          RELATIVE specifies that this component will be the second to the last one in
its row or column, respectively.
</UL>

<P><B>anchor
</P></B>

<P>When the component is smaller than the display area, the value of the anchor
constraint controls where the component should appear. The following list outlines the
available choices:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          NORTH
<LI>          EAST
<LI>          SOUTH
<LI>          WEST
<LI>          NORTHEAST
<LI>          NORTHWEST
<LI>          SOUTHEAST
<LI>          SOUTHWEST
<LI>          CENTER (the default)
</UL>

<P>Line 24 sets the anchor of the Font Label to SOUTHWEST, and line 37 sets the anchor
of the Font Choice to NORTHWEST. This is done to align both components to the left,
and to make them as close as possible to each other vertically.
</P>

<P><B>fill
</P></B>

<P>The fill constraint enables you to control whether a component will be expanded to
fill the display area. The following choices exist:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          HORIZONTAL: Expands the component's width to fill the display area, but
not height.
<LI>          VERTICAL: Expands the component's height to fill the display area, but not width.
<LI>          BOTH: Expands both the component's width and height to fill the display area.
<LI>          NONE: The component is not expanded (the default).
</UL>

<P>Most fill constrain
