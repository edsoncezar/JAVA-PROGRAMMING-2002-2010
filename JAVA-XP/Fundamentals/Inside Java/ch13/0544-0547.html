<OL START="3">
<LI>          Now look at the next five lines:
</OL>
<PRE>
Panel buttonPanel = new Panel();
buttonPanel.add(new Button(&quot;Yes&quot;));
buttonPanel.add(new Button(&quot;No&quot;));
buttonPanel.add(new Button(&quot;Cancel&quot;));
msgDialog.add(&quot;South&quot;, buttonPanel);
</PRE>
<OL START="4">
    This section creates a Panel in which to put the three buttons. The code then
    adds the buttons to the Panel, and adds the Panel to the bottom area of the
    Dialog. Recall that the default layout manager for Panel is FlowLayout.

<LI>          In the last two lines, the size of the dialog box is set to 300 pixels wide and 150
pixels high, and then the dialog box is made visible. This is necessary because Dialogs
are invisible by default.
</OL>
<PRE>
msgDialog.setSize(300, 150);
msgDialog.show();
</PRE>

<P><B>Property Sheets
</P></B>

<P>Property sheets are another kind of Dialog in which the properties of a given
application element (for example, a cell in a spreadsheet, or a selection of text) are displayed
and manipulated. Property sheets are becoming commonplace in applications. See figure
13.8 for an example of a property sheet.

<I>A sample property sheet.</I>
</P>

<P>Property sheets generally consist of the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          GUI components that display and enable the user to change properties. In
figure 13.8, these components include TextField, CheckBox, Choice, and List.
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-545"><P>Page 545</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>          Notebook-style tabs. If too many properties exist, they sometimes are
organized with the use of &quot;tabbed components,&quot; which are components that
resemble notebook tabs. When the user clicks on a tab, the information on that page
is displayed.
</UL>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Please note that the Java AWT does not have the tabbed components, but that they
are available from Java component vendors.
</BLOCKQUOTE></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<UL>
<LI>          Two or more buttons. Property sheets almost always have an OK button and
a Cancel button. Some sheets may have an Apply button for applying
changes without closing the dialog box, and a Reset button for resetting the properties
to their original state.
<LI>          A preview area in which a visual indication of the property changes can be
seen before the user commits to the selection. The example in figure 13.8 has a
preview area that illustrates the effects on the font changes. A Canvas component is
well suited for the preview area.
</UL>

<P>Message boxes and property sheets are not supplied with the JDK, but as you
have seen, you can certainly build them for use within your applications by using the
Dialog class with other AWT components.
</P>

<P><B>FileDialog and Other Common Dialog Boxes
</B></P>

<P>Certain dialog boxes are implemented in different ways depending on the platform,
but have a common function. These dialog boxes have a common look, however,
among applications on the same platform. The FileDialog is an example of such a dialog
box. You can use the FileDialog class within your application to enable the user to
choose either a file to load or a file in which to save their information. Figure 13.9 illustrates
the FileDialog prompting the user for a file to load.

Figure 13.9
<I>Example of a common FileDialog.</I>
</P>



<A NAME="PAGENUM-546"><P>Page 546</P></A>



<P>The following code fragment is used to create the FileDialog in figure 13.9:
</P>
<PRE>
FileDialog fd = new FileDialog(this, &quot;Open&quot;, FileDialog.LOAD);
fd.setDirectory(&quot;c:\\java&quot;);
fd.show();
</PRE>

<P>The first line creates a FileDialog, named fd, and passes it three parameters:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          A frame that owns the FileDialog
<LI>          A String to be displayed on the title bar of the FileDialog
<LI>          An indication of whether this is a load FileDialog or a save FileDialog
</UL>

<P>Table 13.14 lists some frequently used FileDialog methods. For a complete list, refer
to the following Web page:

<P>Other common dialog boxes exist on most platforms for setting fonts, setting colors,
and printing. The only other common dialog box that Java currently implements
(besides FileDialog) is one that obtains information from the user about a print job. Chapter
14, &quot;The New, Improved AWT: Menus, Events, and More New Features,&quot; examines
printing and this Print dialog box in more detail.
</P>

<P><B>General User Input Dialog Boxes
</P></B>

<P>Some dialog boxes are simply used in an application when the application requires
input from the user. These dialog boxes have very general uses and have no typical
case. Developers are on their own when designing them, but some good GUI style guides
on the market can help. A good source for design ideas is to examine the design of
dialog boxes in world-class applications.
