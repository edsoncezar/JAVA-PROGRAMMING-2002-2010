<P>Later in this chapter, you'll see another class called ScrollPane, which is new in JDK
1.1. ScrollPane works in conjunction with the Scrollbar class to make it much easier
to implement a scrolling area associated with scrollbars.
</P>

<P>So far, you've learned to use several Java GUI components. One more component will
be explored in this section&#151;the Canvas component.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch13_ 9">
The Canvas Component
</A></H4>

<P>The Canvas component is the simplest of all the components. This component
is essentially a blank rectangular area in which the application can draw lines and shapes
or display images. All the Graphics methods that you learned in Chapter 9,
&quot;Animating Applets with Java Graphics, Images, Colors, and Sound,&quot; can be used with the
Canvas class. Because the Canvas class is derived from the Component class, it contains all
the inherited capabilities, including appearance management and event-trapping.
</P>

<P>To construct a new Canvas, use a no-argument constructor, as shown here:
</P>
<PRE>
Canvas c = new Canvas();
</PRE>

<P>For more information on the Canvas class, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/java.awt.Canvas.html
</PRE>

<P>You also can subclass the Canvas class to create your own custom components.
You will learn how to create custom components in Chapter 15, &quot;Java Beans: Java's
Component Architecture.&quot;
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch13_ 10">
Interesting Component Class Methods
</A></H4>

<P>Several methods are common to all the classes that you've seen so far in this
chapter. The similarities exist because these classes are derived from the Component class.
Table 13.11 lists some commonly used methods with GUI components. For a complete list,
refer to the following Web page:

<P>You have now seen all the components in the Abstract Window Toolkit. As shown
in the HelloGuiWorld and ScrollbarSlider programs, these components must be placed
in containers before they can be used.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch13_ 11">
Using AWT Containers
</A></H3>

<P>An AWT container is a specialized component that contains other components.
Figure 13.1 shows that the Container class is derived from the Component class. Several
types of containers are derived from the Container class&#151;Panel, Applet, ScrollPane,
Window, Frame, Dialog, and FileDialog.
</P>

<P>Each container has a specialized purpose. A Dialog, for example, appears on the
screen to display and gather input from the user. A ScrollPane is used to manage a
scrolling area, and a Panel is used solely to organize other components. All share a
common function, however&#151;they contain and organize other components. These
components are usually organized with the help of layout managers, which this chapter will discuss
in later sections.
</P>

<P>Table 13.12 lists some frequently used Container methods. Because Container is
an abstract class, always use a derived class, such as Panel or Dialog, to contain
other components. These methods are inherited by the derived classes. For a complete
list, refer to the following Web page:
