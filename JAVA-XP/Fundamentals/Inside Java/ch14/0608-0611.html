getActionCommand() method of the ActionEvent object:
</P>
<PRE>
String command = evt.getActionCommand()
</PRE>

<P>To determine whether a modifier key was being held down when the ActionEvent
was fired, you can use the getModifiers() method. The return value of this method can
be compared to the modifier constants supplied with the ActionEvent class. These
constants are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          ALT_MASK
<LI>          CTRL_MASK
<LI>          META_MASK
<LI>          SHIFT_MASK
</UL>

<P><B>AdjustmentEvent Class</B>
</P>

<P>The AdjustmentEvent class contains the event
type ADJUSTMENT_VALUE_CHANGED, which is the second semantic event type
discussed earlier. An AdjustmentEvent can be fired by:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Manipulating a scrollbar.
<LI>          Manipulating a custom component, such as a slider. As you'll see in Chapter
15, &quot;Java Beans: Java's Component Architecture,&quot; custom components (Beans)
can fire any of the events in the AWT.
</UL>

<P>For an example of using the AdjustmentEvent class, see the ScrollbarSlider example
in Chapter 13. This example uses the getValue() method of the AdjustmentEvent class
to return the current value of the scroll bar.
</P>

<P>The getAdjustable() method returns a reference to the component that fired
the AdjustmentEvent. This reference is of type Adjustable, because all components that
fire this event must implement the Adjustable interface. Note that this method returns
the same reference as getSource() does, except that it is of type Adjustable, which means
that you don't have to cast it. (Chapter 13, &quot;The New, Improved AWT: GUI
Components, Containers, and Layout Managers,&quot; discusses the Adjustable interface.)
</P>

<P>If you need to know what type of adjustment caused the AdjustmentEvent to fire,
call
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-609"><P>Page 609</P></A>


<P>
the getAdjustmentType() method. This returns one of the following values defined in
the AdjustmentEvent class, which indicates the user action that fired the event:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          BLOCK_DECREMENT
<LI>          BLOCK_INCREMENT
<LI>          TRACK
<LI>          UNIT_DECREMENT
<LI>          UNIT_INCREMENT
</UL>

<P>For more information on the AdjustmentEvent class, refer to the following Web page:
</P>

java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent.html
</PRE>

<P><B>ItemEvent Class</B>
</P>

<P>The ItemEvent class contains the event type ITEM_STATE_CHANGED, which is
the third semantic event type discussed earlier. An ItemEvent can be fired by selecting
or deselecting an item in a
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          List
<LI>          Choice
<LI>          Checkbox
<LI>          CheckboxMenuItem
<LI>          Custom component (Java Bean)
</UL>

<P>To determine which type of state change caused the ItemEvent to fire, you can call
the getStateChange() method. This returns one of the following values defined in the
ItemEvent class, which indicates whether the user selected or deselected the item:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          SELECTED
<LI>          DESELECTED
</UL>

<P>The WishList applet (listing 14.2) uses
getStateChange() (in line 59) to determine whether
the affected item is currently selected.
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-610"><P>Page 610</P></A>


<PRE>
057           // Find out if this event was caused by the user
058           // selecting the item (as opposed to deselecting it)
059           if (e.getStateChange() == ItemEvent.SELECTED) {
060               // Convert the selected item to lower case
061               int sel = ((Integer)(e.getItem())).intValue();
062               replaceItem(getItem(sel).toLowerCase(), sel);
063               // The replaceItem disturbs the selection
064               select(sel);
065           }
</PRE>

<P>The ItemEvent class also contains the
getItemSelectable() method, which returns a
reference to the component that fired the ItemEvent. This reference is of type
ItemSelectable, because all components that fire this event must implement the ItemSelectable
interface. This method returns the same reference as
getSource() does, except that it is of type ItemSelectable.
</P>

<P>The getItem() method of the ItemEvent class returns an object that identifies the item
that was changed. In the case of a List, for example,
getItem() returns an Integer instance that contains an index of the item that incurred the state change. The WishList applet
uses the getItem() method of the ItemEvent class in line 61 to determine which item in the
list was newly selected.
</P>
<PRE>
061               int sel = ((Integer)(e.getItem())).intValue();
</PRE>

<P>Note the distinction between this getItem() and the List class method named
getItem() used in line 62:
</P>
<PRE>
062               replaceItem(getItem(sel).toLowerCase(), sel);
</PRE>

<P>For more information on the ItemEvent class, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

java.awt.event.ItemEvent.html
</PRE>

<P><B>ComponentEvent Class</B>
</P>

<P>The ComponentEvent class is the root class for all low-level event classes. This
class introduces a method named getComponent(), which can be used on any of its subclasses
to return a Component reference to the component that fired the event. This returns
the same reference as the getSource() method of the EventObject class, except that it is
a Component reference, not an Object reference.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-611"><P>Page 611</P></A>



<P>You can use the inherited getId() method to determine which event type was fired.
These event types correspond to the ComponentListener methods, so it is not necessary
to check for event type when you are in one of these methods. The
getId() method is useful, however, when using the Extended Component Event Model, which is discussed later
in this chapter. The ComponentEvent event types are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          COMPONENT_HIDDEN
<LI>          COMPONENT_MOVED
<LI>          COMPONENT_RESIZED
<LI>          COMPONENT_SHOWN
</UL>

<P>Any component in the Component hierarchy can fire a ComponentEvent. For
more information on the ComponentEvent class, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/
java.awt.event.ComponentEvent.html
</PRE>

<P><B>FocusEvent Class</B>
</P>

<P>The FocusEvent class contains the following event types, which correspond to
the methods in the FocusListener class:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          FOCUS_GAINED
<LI>          FOCUS_LOST
</UL>

<P>As with any other subclass of AWTEvent, you can use
getId() to determine which of these event types was fired.
</P>

<P>Any component in the Component hierarchy can receive a FocusEvent. For
more information on the FocusEvent class, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/
java.awt.event.FocusEvent.html
</PRE>

<P><B>InputEvent Class</B>
</P>

<P>The event listeners do not use InputEvent class&#151;this is the root class for all
input events. Figure 14.6 shows that InputEvent acts as the parent class of KeyEvent
and MouseEvent, both of which are discussed next.
