<LI>          The ITEM_STATE_CHANGED event type is fired when the user selects
or deselects an item in a List, Choice, Checkbox, or CheckboxMenuItem. This
event type has a semantic meaning of &quot;the state of an item has changed.&quot;

The difference between low-level events and semantic events can be confusing.
The basic difference is that low-level events have no semantic meaning associated with
them, and semantic events have a semantic meaning associated with them. For example,
when you click a check box with a mouse, several events are emitted. Two of these events
are MouseEvent.MOUSE_CLICKED which is a low-level event,
and ItemEvent.ITEM_STATE_CHANGED which is a semantic event.
The MouseEvent.MOUSE_CLICKED event is a specific event that happens to a
GUI component, but has no semantic meaning associated with it.
The ItemEvent.ITEM_STATE_CHANGED event has a semantic meaning associated
with it: &quot;the state of an item has changed.&quot; It is not tied to a specific low-level user
interface event, rather it can be triggered by a clicking the check box or pressing the space
bar when the check box has keyboard focus. Semantic events are useful because you
don't have to be concerned with all of the low-level events that can produce the
higher-level, semantic event.

</TABLE></CENTER>
</P>
<P>Low-level and semantic events are grouped and organized into a hierarchy of
event classes, which this chapter will discuss after examining the event listener classes.
</P>

<P><B>The Event Listener Interfaces
</P></B>

<P>Nine event listener interfaces exist: Three listen for semantic events and six listen
for low-level events. The java.awt.event package includes each of these listener
interfaces, which are derived from the java.util.EventListener interface.
</P>

<P>The three semantic event listeners are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          ActionListener
<LI>          AdjustmentListener
<LI>          ItemListener
</UL>
<P>The six low-level event listeners are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>         ComponentListener
<LI>         FocusListener
</UL>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-599"><P>Page 599</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>          KeyListener
<LI>          MouseListener
<LI>          MouseMotionListener
<LI>          WindowListener
</UL>

<P>Let's examine these event listeners one at a time:
</P>

<P><B>ActionListener
</P></B>

<P>An ActionListener listens for the ACTION_PERFORMED event type described
previously. This event listener has one method, which is called when an event
source registered with this listener fires an ACTION_PERFORMED event type. This method
is the actionPerformed(ActionEvent).
</P>

<P>Notice the similarity between the event type &quot;ACTION_PERFORMED&quot; (which is
actually the name of the constant that the ActionEvent class uses to identify this event type)
and the method name &quot;actionPerformed.&quot; This similarity is repeated for all event types
with corresponding event listener methods.
</P>

<P>The argument passed to all the event listener methods is an instance of the event
class that contains the event type that was fired. The listener method can call methods of
this object to gain more information about the event. For example, the
getSource() method returns the <I>event source</I>, which is the component that fired the event.
</P>

<P>The previous MenuDemo example demonstrates the use of ActionListener. For
more information on ActionListener, refer to the following Web page:

java.awt.event.ActionListener.html
</PRE>

<P><B>AdjustmentListener
</P></B>

<P>An AdjustmentListener listens for the ADJUSTMENT_VALUE_CHANGED event
type described earlier. This event has one method, which is called when an event
source registered with this listener fires an ADJUSTMENT_VALUE_CHANGED event
type. This method is the
adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent).
</P>

<P>Look at the ScrollbarSlider example in Chapter 13 for an example of how to
use AdjustmentListener. For more information on AdjustmentListener, refer to the
following Web page:
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-600"><P>Page 600</P></A>

<PRE>

java.awt.event.AdjustmentListener.html
</PRE>

<P><B>ItemListener
</P></B>

<P>An ItemListener listens for the ITEM_STATE_CHANGED event type described
earlier. This event listener has one method, which is called when an event source registered
with this listener fires an ITEM_STATE_CHANGED event type. This method is
the itemStateChanged(ItemEvent).
</P>

<P>For more information on ItemListener, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/
java.awt.event.ItemListener.html
</PRE>

<P><B>ComponentListener
</P></B>

<P>A ComponentListener listens for event types contained in the ComponentEvent
class. This event listener has four methods, each of which correspond to an event type in
the ComponentEvent class. These methods are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          componentHidden(ComponentEvent)
<LI>          componentMoved(ComponentEvent)
<LI>          componentResized(ComponentEvent)
<LI>          componentShown(ComponentEvent)
</UL>

<P>The event types to which they correspond are
COMPONENT_HIDDEN, COMPONENT_MOVED, COMPONENT_RESIZED, and COMPONENT_SHOWN.
</P>

<P>Although the AWT automatically handles moving, resizing, showing, and
hiding components, you can override these methods to notify you as these events occur.
For more information on ComponentListener, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

java.awt.event.ComponentListener.html
</PRE>

<P><B>FocusListener
</P></B>

<P>A FocusListener listens for event types contained in the FocusEvent class. This
event
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-601"><P>Page 601</P></A>


<P>listener has two methods, each of which correspond to an event type in the
FocusEvent class. These methods are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          focusGained(FocusEvent)
<LI>          focusLost(FocusEvent)
</UL>

<P>You could use these methods to perform edit checks on a text field when the user
tabs away from it, for example. For more information on FocusListener, refer to the
following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/
java.awt.event.FocusListener.html
</PRE>

<P><B>KeyListener
</P></B>

<P>A KeyListener listens for event types contained in the KeyEvent class. This
event listener has three methods, each of which correspond to an event type in the
KeyEvent class. These methods are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          keyPressed(KeyEvent)
<LI>          keyReleased(KeyEvent)
<LI>          keyTyped(KeyEvent)
</UL>

<P>You could use these methods to do your own text field formatting, for example. For
more information on KeyListener, refer to the following Web page:
</P>
<PRE>

http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/
java.awt.event.KeyListener.html
</PRE>

<P><B>MouseListener
</P></B>

<P>A MouseListener listens for some of event types contained in the MouseEvent
class. This event listener has five methods, each of which correspond to an event type in
the MouseEvent class. These methods are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>         mouseClicked(MouseEvent)
<LI>         mouseEntered(MouseEvent)
<LI>         mouseExited(MouseEvent)
</UL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-602"><P>Page 602</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>         mousePressed(MouseEvent)
<LI>         mouseReleased(MouseEvent)
</UL>

<P>Lines 187_196 in listing 14.1 demonstrate how to use a MouseListener to know when
to make a pop-up menu appear:
</P>
<PRE>
187       public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent evt) {
188           Component comp = (Component)evt.getSource();
189           // Find out if the mouse event was a popup menu request
190           if (evt.isPopupTrigger()) {
191               if (evt.getSource() == md.btn2)
192                   md.popMenu2.show(comp, evt.getX(), evt.getY());
193               else
194                   md.popMenu1.show(comp, evt.getX(), evt.getY());
195           }
196       }

</PRE>

<P><B>MouseMotionListener
</P></B>

<P>A MouseMotionListener listens for the motion-oriented event types contained in
the MouseEvent class. This event listener has two methods, each of which correspond to
an event type in the MouseEvent class. These methods are:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          mouseDragged(MouseEvent)
<LI>          mouseMoved(MouseEvent)
</UL>

<P>You could use these methods to implement a drawing pad within an application,
for example. For more information on MouseMotionListener, refer to the following
