Simplicity of Use
</A></H4>

<P>Java was designed with the intent of keeping the language simple but powerful
enough to perform network computing tasks for the Web. This simplicity and power is
also helpful in developing applications for intranets. To meet the goal of simplicity,
the designers of the language kept the number of language constructs small. This makes
it easier for people to learn the language, yet keeps the compilers smaller and easier
to implement.
</P>

<P>The designers also based the language on the C/C++ syntax. A large body of
competent C/C++ programmers exists, and these people would find the language easy to  migrate
to and to learn. Some of the features of C/C++ were deliberately removed to keep the
Java language simple and secure. As an example, the Java language does not support
goto statements; instead it provides exceptional handling, labeled break and continue,
and finally, statements. The C/C++ language header files have been removed. There are
no #include preprocessor statements in Java; instead, the Java import statement is used
to selectively import a Java class or all classes in the specified package.
</P>

<P>To support the development of large software in a modular fashion, the concept
of package is used. A <I>package</I> is a collection of Java code grouped together because
of similarity of function.
</P>

<P>Other differences with C/C++ include the removal of support for data structures such
as struct and union. A similar concept can be implemented by the class construct.
Also operator overloading and multiple-inheritance capabilities of C++ have been
eliminated to keep the Java language simple.
</P>

<P>One of the biggest changes from C/C++ is the removal of the direct use of
pointers. Although pointers in C/C++ are very powerful mechanisms, they require discipline to
use them correctly and to ensure that the code that uses them is bug free. Real life
experience from maintaining C/C++ code suggests that the use of pointers in C/C++ creates
error prone programs. Java automatically handles referencing and dereferencing of
language objects. This frees you from the problems of dangling reference pointers, invalid
pointer references, memory leaks, and so on. Objects are created dynamically and
garbage collection is performed automatically in the background by the Java
environment. Incorrect use of memory allocation is another common source of error in C/C++
programs. By having the Java environment perform this automatically, memory type
errors are reduced.
</P>

<P>Even though the Java language has been simplified in comparison with C/C++, it
comes with a very rich set of predefined classes to perform I/O, network, and graphic
operations. This makes the Java language easy and powerful enough for developing
network-enabled intranet applications.

Object-Oriented Nature
</A></H4>

<P>Java is an object-oriented language. In this language, all programs and data always
exist in the context of objects. An <I>object</I> is a collection of data and the programs that
operate on it. The programs are written specifically for the data that resides in the object and
are called object methods. In fact, one of the parameters to the method is the object
itself (referred to in the Java language by a special reserved word called &quot;this&quot;). As the
name &quot;method&quot; suggests, the object methods are the mechanism used to operate on the
data held in the object. The data and the methods describe the state of the object.
</P>
<P>The notion of an object in Java is implemented by the class construct. The use of
classes is so fundamental to the Java language that it is not possible to write a Java program
that does something meaningful without using the class construct.
</P>

<P>Code reuse is supported in Java by using object inheritance. A class can be derived
from another class. This process is called inheritance or subclassing. The Java
language comes with useful predefined class hierarchies. At the very top is the special
class Object. This is the root class from which all other classes become subclasses. By
default, a newly created class always inherits from the root class Object, even though you
may not explicitly define a class that you inherit from. The predefined Java class
hierarchies provide the richness of the Java environment.
</P>

<P>In fact, the biggest learning curve in Java does not come from the language syntax or
the language semantics, both of which are relatively straightforward and easy to learn.
The biggest challenge lies in becoming familiar with the predefined class hierarchies and
the methods and their purpose. Of course, you could always start from scratch and
reinvent a new set of class hierarchies to replace the existing rebuilt hierarchies, but you would
be a lot less productive.
</P>

<P>By using inheritance, you can always use the concept of code reuse and
subclass existing class hierarchies. Where the desired class hierarchies are not adequate
or available, you can always create your own.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 6">
A Distributed Language
</A></H4>

<P>Java was designed to support applications that run on a network. This network could
be the Internet or corporate intranets. Java provides network capabilities by using
a predefined language package called Java.net. This package contains many classes
to simplify network communications between applications running on different
computers on a network. By using Java, you can access remote or local files with equal ease.
In addition, a virtual circuit network connection is supported by the language, which can
be used to build distributed client/server software for intranets.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 7">
An Interpreted Language
</A></H4>

<P>The Java compiler does not produce the machine language instructions that make up
the executable Java program. Instead, the Java compiler produces an intermediate
code called byte codes. The Java byte codes are read by a Java interpreter and executed by
it using an internal model of an abstract machine. The Java interpreter, and the
implementation of this abstract machine, are called the <I>Java Virtual
Machine</I> (JVM).
</P>
<P>The Java byte code is an architecturally neutral representation of the program.
Because the Java program is executed by interpreting the Java byte codes, the Java language
is interpretive. In an interpretive environment the standard &quot;link&quot; phase of
patching together the object modules to form a binary executable set of machine
instructions vanishes. The linking phase is replaced by the loading of the new class into the
Java environment. Interpretive environments, such as Java, support rapid prototyping
and program development.
</P>

<P>Just In Time (JIT) compilers are also available for those applications that cannot
afford the overhead of an interpretive execution of Java code. These JIT compilers translate
the byte code into the machine language instructions of the computer on which the
program is run. This leads to significant improvements in performance. Of course, the output
of the JIT compilers is no longer architecturally neutral.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 8">
A Robust Language
</A></H4>

<P>When programmers talk about robustness in a language, they mean the support
for eliminating error prone constructs both at compile and runtime. Java is a strongly
typed language, which means that well-defined rules have been established on how objects
are to be used. You cannot assign, for example, a floating point number to an integer
value without a loss in precision. The compiler will catch this and other similar errors at
compile time. You can explicitly force certain types of objects into others by an explicit
type conversion (casting) or by writing conversion programs, but this is an explicit action
that has to be performed by the programmer and will not be done automatically by the
Java language.
</P>

<P>The Java memory model performs automatic garbage collection, thus eliminating
another important class of runtime errors. Pointers are not directly supported, and this
eliminates pointer-related runtime errors such as inadvertent data overwrites and memory
corruption. The Java interpreter also performs runtime checks, such as ensuring that array
and string accesses are within the bounds of the array size.
