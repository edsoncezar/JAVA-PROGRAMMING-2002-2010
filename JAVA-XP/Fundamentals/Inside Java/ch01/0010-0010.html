<P>Most programs that use some form of multitasking or multithreading make low-level
calls for system services to the operating system on which they run. Because of differences
in system service calls, these programs are not portable to different operating
system types. With Java, however, you can write a multithreaded program that could
run without alteration on different machines and operating system types.

A Dynamic Language
</A></H4>




<P>Java is a dynamic language in the sense that it loads the classes it needs as they
are needed. You can determine at runtime which class an object belongs to by checking
the run-type information associated with the class. The runtime class definitions make
it easy to perform dynamic linking of classes.

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>In this chapter you have been introduced to the features of the Java language. Java is
a new programming language from Sun Microsystems and has a number of
characteristics that make it suitable for use with Internet applications such as the World Wide
Web. The features of the Java language were discussed without going into the details of
the elements of the language so that you can have a broader understanding of what
Java can do for you. A key aspect of the Java language is that it is not limited to being
used exclusively on the Internet. Java's cross-platform portability is very attractive and
makes it a good choice for many internal corporate networks.
