Introduction to Java

</H2>

<P>Java is a new programming language from Sun Microsystems. Java
has a number of characteristics that make it suitable for use with
Internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, although it is
not limited exclusively to the Internet. Java's
cross-platform portability is very attractive, which makes it a good choice for
many internal corporate networks. The Java language has also been used
for the development of large scale software systems. This
experience suggests that the language can be used as a general purpose tool
for writing business and scientific logic. Java's support for rich classes
and object inheritance enables a programmer to reuse existing code and
to write complex applications quickly.

The Java Language
</A></H3>

<P>The origins of the Java language can be traced to an attempt by software
engineers years ago to write portable software for controlling consumer electronics devices,
such as ovens, toasters, TVs, VCRs, lights, telephones, pagers, set-top boxes, personal
digital assistants, and so on. In April 1991, a group of Sun Microsystem employees
began working on a project with the code name &quot;Green.&quot; The goal of the Green project was
to develop a system for developing consumer electronics' logic. The Sun
Microsystem employees quickly realized that there were no standards in consumer electronics as
to which type of processor was actually used. To simplify development for
consumer electronics, these Sun employees needed a platform-independent environment.
</P>

<P>James Gosling (creator of the UNIX EMACS editor and NeWS window system) at
Sun Microsystems initially attempted to extend the C++ language. This was considered to
be too much effort and not an avenue that would yield the best results. Therefore,
work began on a new language for the Green project called Oak. The name Oak came to
James Gosling when he saw an oak tree outside his window as he was entering the
directory structure for the new language. Later on, the name Oak had to be discarded because
it was a name already used by an older language. After many hours of
brainstorming, inspiration struck one day after the team members visited a local coffee shop.
Therefore, contrary to popular belief, Java is not an acronym for &quot;Just Another Vague
Acronym.&quot; There were four elements to the Oak development platform: the language Oak,
an operating system code named GreenOS, a user interface, and a PDA-like device
code named *7. The name &quot;*7&quot; came from the telephone sequence used to answer any
ringing phone in the Sand Hill offices where the Green project members had their offices. The
*7 device was envisioned as a generic control device that could be sold to
consumer electronic manufacturers who could incorporate it into their products. The user
interface consisted of a full-color animated representation of a home (or office) where
appliances could be manipulated by touching the screen.
</P>

<P>In 1993, the Green team, now incorporated into a Sun Microsystems spin-off
called &quot;FirstPerson, Inc.,&quot; made a bid for the Time-Warner TV trial where many homes
were supposed to have experimental video on demand hardware for testing. By June
1993, however, Time-Warner had selected Silicon Graphics, Inc. over the Green
team's proposal. In 1994, another deal with the company 3DO fell through, and the prospects
of new marketing partners looked bleak. FirstPerson's public launch was cancelled, and
the newly formed corporation dissolved. Half the Green team members went to work for
Sun Interactive to work on digital video servers; the other half went back to the parent
Sun company to work on multimedia and network-based computing.

<P>While all this was happening to the Green team, the Web was gaining larger
acceptance, particularly with the development of powerful GUI Web clients that gave the
user considerable flexibility and navigational power. At this time it was becoming
apparent that Internet growth was being fueled by the World Wide Web. Sun
Microsystems realized the potential for using the Oak technology and developed the
WebRunner browser, later renamed HotJava.
</P>

<P>The development of the *7 device and the Video On Demand (VOD) technologies
helped to mature the Java language. The Java compiler, which was first written in C, was
later rewritten in Java by Arthur Van Hoff. Compilers are complex pieces of software, and
the rewrite of the Java compiler in the Java language demonstrated the general
purpose nature of Java.
</P>

<P>On May 23, 1995 the Java environment was announced by Sun Microsystems
at SunWorld '95. The flurry of activity and interest in Java that followed is a testimony
of the interest and promise that this technology holds for the future of network computing.
</P>

<P>Popular browsers, such as the Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer,
incorporate Java-based technology. These browsers can run Java programs that are
downloaded from remote Web servers. Java programs for the Web are called Java
<I>applets</I>. The description of Java applets is embedded in the HTML pages as URL addresses.
Because the URL addresses can refer to any computer on the network, the HTTP protocol and
the HTML language can be used to distribute code for execution on the intranet or
the Internet.
</P>

Special Features
</A></H4>

<P>Sun describes its Java language as a simple, distributed, interpreted, secure,
architecturally neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, and dynamic language. That is
a lot of adjectives, and some people may even classify them as buzzwords.
</P>

<P>Some of these buzzwords have also been used to describe other languages, but
what makes Java unique is that it is the first language that can be used for writing
general purpose programs, as well as programs designed specifically for use on internets
and intranets. When used for Internet or intranet applications, Java programs are
typically used while viewing Web pages in conjunction with using a tool such as a Web
browser. Java programs that are designed to be run within a Web browser are called
applets. General purpose Java programs that can be run stand-alone, outside a Web browser,
are called Java applications. You will learn more about the distinction between these ways
of writing programs as you progress through this book.
