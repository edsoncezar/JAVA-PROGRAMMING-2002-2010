<P>Java supports explicit exception handling in the language, which gives the
programmer an additional tool to write robust programs. Besides the predefined exceptional
conditions that indicate potential problems, the programmer can define his or her own
exceptions.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 9">
A Secure Language
</A></H4>

<P>Because Java code is expected to run in a networked environment with untrusted
host computers, the language was designed with security as a major goal. Java code,
which resides at a Web server, can be downloaded and run within the Java Virtual
Machine provided by the Web browser. There is nothing to prevent viruses and other
malicious programs from masquerading as legitimate code and causing damage to the
client computer or other computers on the network.
</P>

<P>A technique many virus programs use to cause damage is to get hold of
machine resources by the clever manipulation of address variables such as pointers. This is
one of the reasons the Java designers decided not to support pointers in the language,
which also eliminates a major security risk.
</P>

<P>Memory allocation and layout of classes are done transparently by the Java
environment. Because the programmer does not have access to the memory layout, he or
she cannot know the actual memory layout that is used. This makes it difficult for
virus programs to access the internal data structures of the Java program.
</P>

<P>Before a Java program is interpreted, the Java runtime system performs a
byte-code verification. Byte-code verification is a formal process in which mathematical
algorithms are used to ensure that the program is not violating system integrity.
Additionally, programs that are loaded from across the Net are loaded in a separate name space
than local classes. This prevents a malicious Java applet from replacing standard Java classes.
</P>

<P>Java anticipates and protects against traditional techniques used to cause the
program to misbehave. It cannot, however, guarantee or claim a 100 percent fool-proof
environment. A number of malicious and wily hackers will see in Java a new challenge
to overcome. As these cases come up, Sun Microsystems will have to plug the
security holes and stay one step ahead of these hackers.
</P>

<P>Although security is important in an Internet environment, it is less so than in
the intranet environment. The primary reason for this is that intranets have less exposure
to malicious users than the Internet. Because Java is designed to provide a safe
execution environment on the Internet, it can certainly meet the needs of most intranets.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 10">
Architecturally Neutral
</A></H4>

<P>A compiled Java program produces byte code that is interpreted in the Java
Virtual Machine. The byte code is independent of any specific processor type and
machine architecture. Use of the byte code enables the Java code to run on any machine
that supports the Java Virtual Machine and Java interpreter.
</P>


<P>The architectural neutrality of Java is important for intranets because it enables
program code to be written just once in Java. The same program code can then run across
a variety of different client or server platforms. Figure 1.1 shows the same Java applet
code downloaded into different client platforms.
</P>

<P>Currently, many organizations spend a great deal of effort and money trying to
cover every possible platform they need to support. With different versions of
UNIX, Windows NT, Windows 95, OS/2, and Macintosh computers, it is a challenge to
write software that can run on all these platforms. Java goes a long way toward helping
with this challenge.<BR>

A Portable Platform
</A></H4>

<P>Because Java code is architecturally neutral, it
can be run on any platform. The code needs to be written once, and the byte code can then be distributed to different
platforms and run unchanged. A constant source of portability problems in other
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-9"><P>Page 9</P></A>


<P>languages is the difference in implementation of the size of basic language types such as
integers, characters, and floating point numbers.
</P>

<P>You need, for example, to know whether or not a basic integer type is 16 bits long or
32 bits long. In Java, all basic types have the same size regardless of the platform on
which they run. An integer type in Java, for example, is always a signed 32-bit value whether
it runs on a UNIX machine or on an OS/2 machine. The use of a standard definition of
an
</P>

integer type avoids errors, such as overflow or underflow, that typically arise due to
an incorrect assumption made on the size of the basic types.
</P>
<P>Because Java applets are GUI-based and can be multithreaded, Java programs can
run only on those environments that have these features. It would be difficult, for
example, to have Java code run on MS-DOS machines that do not support a GUI inter-face
or multitasking.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 12">
A High-Performance Vehicle
</A></H4>

<P>Java is high performance compared to other scripting languages such as the varieties
of Basic and Visual Basic languages, shell scripts, and Perl. It is, however, about 20
times slower than the C language. For many interactive applications the speed of Java
is adequate.
</P>

<P>If you want to make the speed of Java comparable with C, you will have to use Just
In Time compilers. Examples of JIT are available from several vendors, such as
Sun, Borland, Symantec, and so on. Web browsers are licensing JIT compilers to
provide accelerators to improve the performance of applets. The Java byte code was designed
to provide a quick translation from the byte code format to the machine instructions
for processors. So the performance of byte codes converted to machine instructions
is comparable to C/C++ programs.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 13">
A Multithreaded Language
</A></H4>

<P>Java is one of the few languages (Ada is another) that provides support for
multi-tasking in the form of multithreading within the language itself. This means that you can
write Java programs where multiple threads are executing simultaneously. A thread is
an independent line of execution through a program. Threads can be used to implement
a level of parallelism in the program. Each thread performs a specialized function.
With several threads running, several parallel activities are taking place. On a single
processor machine, the threads will each have to have their turn at executing on the CPU, so it
only appears as if the threads are executing simultaneously. In reality, each thread runs for
a duration of time before it is pre-empted and another thread gets a chance to run. On
a multiprocessor machine, threads can be simultaneously executing on different
processors. To prevent threads from tripping over each other when critical operations are
being performed, you can specify critical regions by using the synchronized keyword.
