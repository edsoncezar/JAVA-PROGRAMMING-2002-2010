<h2><a name="2801"><i>	6.2	</i> Security Checks in the Class Loader
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="2802"><!-- --></a>
While a Java program is executing, it may in its turn request that a particular class or set of classes be loaded, possibly from across the network. After incoming code has been vetted and determined clean by the bytecode verifier, the next line of defense is the Java bytecode loader. The environment seen by a thread of execution running Java bytecodes can be visualized as a set of classes partitioned into separate <em>name spaces</em>. There is one name space for classes that come from the local file system, and a separate name space for each network source.<p>
<a name="2803"><!-- --></a>
When a class is imported from across the network it is placed into the private name space associated with its origin. When a class references another class, it is first looked for in the name space for the local system (built-in classes), then in the name space of the referencing class. There is no way that an imported class can &#34;spoof&#34; a built-in class. Built-in classes can never accidentally reference classes in imported name spaces&#45;&#45;they can only reference such classes explicitly. Similarly, classes imported from different places are separated from each other.<p>
