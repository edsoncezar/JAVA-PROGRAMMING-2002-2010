<h2><a name="334"><i>	1.2	</i> Design Goals of Java
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="336"><!-- --></a>
The design requirements of Java are driven by the nature of the computing environments in which software must be deployed.<p>
<a name="339"><!-- --></a>
The massive growth of the Internet and the World-Wide Web leads us to a completely new way of looking at development and distribution of software. To live in the world of electronic commerce and distribution, Java must enable the development of <em>secure, high performance,</em> and highly <em>robust</em> applications on <em>multiple platforms</em> in <em>heterogeneous</em>, <em>distributed</em> <em>networks</em>.<p>
<a name="341"><!-- --></a>
Operating on multiple platforms in heterogeneous networks invalidates the traditional schemes of binary distribution, release, upgrade, patch, and so on. To survive in this jungle, Java must be <em>architecture neutral</em>, <em>portable</em>, and <em>dynamically adaptable</em>. <p>
<a name="343"><!-- --></a>
The Java system that emerged to meet these needs is <em>simple</em>, so it can be easily programmed by most developers; <em>familiar</em>, so that current developers can easily learn Java; <em>object oriented</em>, to take advantage of modern software development methodologies and to fit into distributed client-server applications; <em>multithreaded</em>, for high performance in applications that need to perform multiple concurrent activities, such as multimedia; and <em>interpreted</em>, for maximum portability and dynamic capabilities.<p>
<a name="345"><!-- --></a>
Together, the above requirements comprise quite a collection of buzzwords, so let&#39;s examine some of them and their respective benefits before going on.<p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>
<a name="349"><!-- --></a>
<i>	1.2.1	</i> Simple, Object Oriented, and Familiar
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="351"><!-- --></a>
Primary characteristics of Java include a <em>simple</em> language that can be programmed without extensive programmer training while being attuned to current software practices. The fundamental concepts of Java are grasped quickly; programmers can be productive from the very beginning.<p>
<a name="1198"><!-- --></a>
Java is designed to be <em>object oriented</em> from the ground up. Object technology has finally found its way into the programming mainstream after a gestation period of thirty years. The needs of distributed, client-server based systems coincide with the encapsulated, message-passing paradigms of object-based software. To function within increasingly complex, network-based environments, programming systems must adopt object-oriented concepts. Java provides a clean and efficient object-based development platform.<p>
<a name="1200"><!-- --></a>
Programmers using Java can access existing libraries of tested objects that provide functionality ranging from basic data types through I/O and network interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits. These libraries can be extended to provide new behavior.<p>
<a name="355"><!-- --></a>
Even though C++ was rejected as an implementation language, keeping Java looking like C++ as far as possible results in Java being a <em>familiar</em> language, while removing the unnecessary complexities of C++. Having Java retain many of the object-oriented features and the &#34;look and feel&#34; of C++ means that programmers can migrate easily to Java and be productive quickly.<p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>
<a name="367"><!-- --></a>
<i>	1.2.2	</i> Robust and Secure
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="369"><!-- --></a>
Java is designed for creating highly <em>reliable</em> software. It provides extensive compile-time checking, followed by a second level of run-time checking. Language features guide programmers towards reliable programming habits. <p>
<a name="1182"><!-- --></a>
The memory management model is extremely simple: objects are created with a <kbd>new</kbd> operator. There are no explicit programmer-defined pointer data types, no pointer arithmetic, and automatic garbage collection. This simple memory management model eliminates entire classes of programming errors that bedevil C and C++ programmers. You can develop Java language code with confidence that the system will find many errors quickly and that major problems won&#39;t lay dormant until after your production code has shipped.<p>
<a name="375"><!-- --></a>
Java is designed to operate in distributed environments, which means that <em>security</em> is of paramount importance. With security features designed into the language and run-time system, Java lets you construct applications that can&#39;t be invaded from outside. In the network environment, applications written in Java are secure from intrusion by unauthorized code attempting to get behind the scenes and create viruses or invade file systems.<p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>
<a name="379"><!-- --></a>
<i>	1.2.3	</i> Architecture Neutral and Portable
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="814"><!-- --></a>
Java is designed to support applications that will be deployed into heterogeneous network environments. In such environments, applications must be capable of executing on a variety of hardware architectures. Within this variety of hardware platforms, applications must execute atop a variety of operating systems and interoperate with multiple programming language interfaces. To accommodate the diversity of operating environments, the Java compiler generates <em>bytecodes</em>&#45;&#45;an <em>architecture neutral</em> intermediate format designed to transport code efficiently to multiple hardware and software platforms. The interpreted nature of Java solves both the binary distribution problem and the version problem; the same Java language byte codes will run on any platform.<p>
<a name="385"><!-- --></a>
Architecture neutrality is just one part of a truly <em>portable</em> system. Java takes portability a stage further by being strict in its definition of the basic language. Java puts a stake in the ground and specifies the sizes of its basic data types and the behavior of its arithmetic operators. Your programs are the same on every platform&#45;&#45;there are no data type incompatibilities across hardware and software architectures.<p>
<a name="1466"><!-- --></a>
The architecture-neutral and portable language platform of Java is known as the <em>Java Virtual Machine</em>. It&#39;s the specification of an abstract machine for which Java language compilers can generate code. Specific implementations of the Java Virtual Machine for specific hardware and software platforms then provide the concrete realization of the virtual machine. The Java Virtual Machine is based primarily on the POSIX interface specification&#45;&#45;an industry-standard definition of a portable system interface. Implementing the Java Virtual Machine on new architectures is a relatively straightforward task as long as the target platform meets basic requirements such as support for multithreading.<p>

<br>
<h3>
<a name="1751"><!-- --></a>
<i>	1.2.4	</i> High Performance
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="1752"><!-- --></a>
<em>Performance</em> is always a consideration. Java achieves superior performance by adopting a scheme by which the interpreter can run at full speed without needing to check the run-time environment. The <em>automatic garbage collector</em> runs as a low-priority background thread, ensuring a high probability that memory is available when required, leading to better performance. Applications requiring large amounts of compute power can be designed such that compute-intensive sections can be rewritten in native machine code as required and interfaced with the Java platform. In general, users perceive that interactive applications respond quickly even though they&#39;re interpreted.<p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<h3>
<a name="528"><!-- --></a>
<i>	1.2.5	</i> Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic
</h3>

<blockquote>
<a name="389"><!-- --></a>
The <em>Java interpreter</em> can execute Java bytecodes directly on any machine to which the interpreter and run-time system have been ported. In an interpreted platform such as Java system, the link phase of a program is simple, incremental, and lightweight. You benefit from much faster development cycles&#45;&#45;prototyping, experimentation, and rapid development are the normal case, versus the traditional heavyweight compile, link, and test cycles.<p>
<a name="1214"><!-- --></a>
Modern network-based applications, such as the HotJava World-Wide Web browser, typically need to do several things at the same time. A user working with HotJava can run several animations concurrently while downloading an image and scrolling the page. Java&#39;s <em>multithreading</em> capability provides the means to build applications with many concurrent threads of activity. Multithreading thus results in a high degree of interactivity for the end user.<p>
<a name="1215"><!-- --></a>
Java supports multithreading at the language level with the addition of sophisticated synchronization primitives: the language library provides the <kbd>Thread</kbd> class, and the run-time system provides monitor and condition lock primitives. At the library level, moreover, Java&#39;s high-level system libraries have been written to be <em>thread safe</em>:<em> </em>the functionality provided by the libraries is available without conflict to multiple concurrent threads of execution.<p>
<a name="393"><!-- --></a>
While the Java compiler is strict in its compile-time static checking, the language and run-time system are <em>dynamic</em> in their linking stages. Classes are linked only as needed. New code modules can be linked in on demand from a variety of sources, even from sources across a network. In the case of the HotJava browser and similar applications, interactive executable code can be loaded from anywhere, which enables transparent updating of applications. The result is on-line services that constantly evolve; they can remain innovative and fresh, draw more customers, and spur the growth of electronic commerce on the Internet. <p>

<h2><a name="937"><i>	1.3	</i> The Java Platform&#45;&#45;a New Approach to Distributed Computing
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="409"><!-- --></a>
Taken individually, the characteristics discussed above can be found in a variety of software development platforms. What&#39;s completely new is the manner in which Java and its run-time system have combined them to produce a flexible and powerful programming system.<p>
<a name="1670"><!-- --></a>
Developing your applications using Java results in software that is <em>portable </em>across multiple machine architectures, operating systems, and graphical user interfaces, <em>secure</em>, and <em>high performance</em>. With Java, your job as a software developer is much easier&#45;&#45;you focus your full attention on the end goal of shipping innovative products on time, based on the solid foundation of Java. The <em>better way</em> to develop software is here, now, brought to you by the Java language platform.<p>
