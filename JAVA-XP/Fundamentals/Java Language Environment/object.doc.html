To stay abreast of modern software development practices, Java is <em>object oriented </em>from the ground<em> </em>up<em>.</em> The point of designing an object-oriented language is not simply to jump on the latest programming fad. The object-oriented paradigm meshes well with the needs of client-server and distributed software. Benefits of object technology are rapidly becoming realized as more organizations move their applications to the distributed client-server model.<p>
<a name="4119"><!-- --></a>
Unfortunately, &#34;object oriented&#34; remains misunderstood, over-marketed as the silver bullet that will solve all our software ills, or takes on the trappings of a religion. The cynic&#39;s view of object-oriented programming is that it&#39;s just a new way to organize your source code. While there may be some merit to this view, it doesn&#39;t tell the whole story, because you can achieve results with object-oriented programming techniques that you can&#39;t with procedural techniques.<p>
<a name="4487"><!-- --></a>
An important characteristic that distinguishes objects from ordinary procedures or functions is that an object can have a lifetime greater than that of the object that created it. This aspect of objects is subtle and mostly overlooked. In the distributed client-server world, you now have the potential for objects to be created in one place, passed around networks, and stored elsewhere, possibly in databases, to be retrieved for future work.<p>
<a name="4117"><!-- --></a>
As an object-oriented language, Java draws on the best concepts and features of previous object-oriented languages, primarily Eiffel, SmallTalk, Objective C, and C++. Java goes beyond C++ in both extending the object model and removing the major complexities of C++. With the exception of its primitive data types, everything in Java is an object, and even the primitive types can be encapsulated within objects if the need arises.<p>
