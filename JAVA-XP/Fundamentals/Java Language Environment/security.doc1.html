<h2><a name="2762"><i>	6.1	</i> Memory Allocation and Layout
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="2344"><!-- --></a>
One of the Java compiler&#39;s primary lines of defense is its memory allocation and reference model. First of all, <em>memory layout</em> decisions are not made by the Java language compiler, as they are in C and C++. Rather, memory layout is deferred to run time, and will potentially differ depending on the characteristics of the hardware and software platforms on which the Java system executes.<p>
<a name="2472"><!-- --></a>
Secondly, Java does not have &#34;pointers&#34; in the traditional C and C++ sense of memory cells that contain the addresses of other memory cells.The Java compiled code references memory via symbolic &#34;handles&#34; that are resolved to real memory addresses at run time by the Java interpreter. Java programmers can&#39;t forge pointers to memory, because the memory allocation and referencing model is completely opaque to the programmer and controlled entirely by the underlying run-time platform.<p>
<a name="1053"><!-- --></a>
Very late binding of structures to memory means that programmers can&#39;t infer the physical memory layout of a class by looking at its declaration. By removing the C and C++ memory layout and pointer models, the Java language has eliminated the programmer&#39;s ability to get behind the scenes and either forge or otherwise manufacture pointers to memory. These features must be viewed as positive benefits rather than a restriction on the programmer, because they ultimately lead to more reliable and secure applications.<p>
