<blockquote>
<a name="2415"><!-- --></a>
To be truly considered &#34;object oriented&#34;, a programming language should support at a minimum four characteristics:<p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>
<a name="2416"><!-- --></a>
<em>Encapsulation</em>&#45;&#45;implements information hiding and modularity (abstraction)
</li>
<li>
<a name="3611"><!-- --></a>
<em>Polymorphism</em>&#45;&#45;the same message sent to different objects results in behavior that&#39;s dependent on the nature of the object receiving the message
</li>
<li>
<a name="3615"><!-- --></a>
<em>Inheritance</em>&#45;&#45;you define new classes and behavior based on existing classes to obtain code re-use and code organization
</li>
<li>
<a name="2418"><!-- --></a>
<em>Dynamic binding</em>&#45;&#45;objects could come from anywhere, possibly across the network. You need to be able to send messages to objects without having to know their specific type at the time you write your code. Dynamic binding provides maximum flexibility while a program is executing
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<a name="1353"><!-- --></a>
Java meets these requirements nicely, and adds considerable run-time support to make your software development job easier.<p>

<h2><a name="1354"><i>	3.2	</i> What Are Objects?
</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<a name="4341"><!-- --></a>
At its simplest, object technology is a collection of analysis, design, and programming methodologies that focuses design on <em>modelling</em> the characteristics and behavior of objects in the real world. True, this definition appears to be somewhat circular, so let&#39;s try to break out into clear air.<p>
<a name="1355"><!-- --></a>
What are objects? They&#39;re software programming <em>models</em>. In your everyday life, you&#39;re surrounded by objects: cars, coffee machines, ducks, trees, and so on. Software applications contain objects: buttons on user interfaces, spreadsheets and spreadsheet cells, property lists, menus, and so on. These objects have <em>state</em> and <em>behavior</em>. You can represent all these things with software constructs called objects, which can also be defined by their <em>state</em> and their <em>behavior</em>.<p>
<a name="1356"><!-- --></a>
In your everyday transportation needs, a <em>car</em> can be modelled by an object. A car has <em>state</em> (how fast it&#39;s going, in which direction, its fuel consumption, and so on) and <em>behavior</em> (starts, stops, turns, slides, and runs into trees).<p>
<a name="1357"><!-- --></a>
You drive your car to your office, where you track your stock portfolio. In your daily interactions with the stock markets, a <em>stock</em> can be modelled by an object. A stock has <em>state</em> (daily high, daily low, open price, close price, earnings per share, relative strength), and <em>behavior</em> (changes value, performs splits, has dividends).<p>
<a name="1523"><!-- --></a>
After watching your stock decline in price, you repair to the cafe to console yourself with a cup of good hot coffee. The <em>espresso machine</em> can be modelled as an object. It has <em>state</em> (water temperature, amount of coffee in the hopper) and it has <em>behavior</em> (emits steam, makes noise, and brews a perfect cup of <em>java</em>).<p>
