Programmers using &#34;traditional&#34; software development tools have become resigned to the artificial edit-compile-link-load-throw-the-application-off-the-cliff-let-it-crash-and-start-all-over-again style of current development practice.<p>
<a name="856"><!-- --></a>
Additionally, keeping track of what must be recompiled when a declaration changes somewhere else strains the capabilities of development tools&#45;&#45;even fancy &#34;make&#34;-style tools such as found on UNIX systems. This development approach bogs down as the code bases of applications grow to hundreds of thousands of lines.<p>
<a name="858"><!-- --></a>
Better methods of fast and fearless prototyping and development are needed. The Java language environment is one of those better ways, because it&#39;s <em>interpreted</em> and <em>dynamic</em>.<p>
<a name="309"><!-- --></a>
As discussed in the previous chapter on architecture-neutrality, the Java compiler generates <em>byte codes</em> for the Java Virtual Machine<a href="#2707"><sup>1</sup></a>, which was introduced briefly in <a href="neutral.doc.html#603">Chapter&#160;4</a>. The notion of a virtual interpreted machine is not new. But the Java language brings the concepts into the realm of secure, distributed, network-based systems.<p>
<a name="292"><!-- --></a>
The Java language virtual machine is a strictly defined virtual machine for which an <em>interpreter</em> must be available for each hardware architecture and operating system on which you wish to run Java language applications. Once you have the Java language interpreter and run-time support available on a given hardware and operating system platform, you can run any Java language application from anywhere, always assuming the specific Java language application is written in a portable manner.<p>
<a name="294"><!-- --></a>
The notion of a separate &#34;link&#34; phase after compilation is pretty well absent from the Java environment. Linking, which is actually the process of loading new classes by the <em>Class Loader</em>, is a more incremental and lightweight process. The concomitant speedup in your development cycle means that your development process can be much more rapid and exploratory, and because of the robust nature of the Java language and run-time system, you will catch bugs at a much earlier phase of the cycle.<p>
