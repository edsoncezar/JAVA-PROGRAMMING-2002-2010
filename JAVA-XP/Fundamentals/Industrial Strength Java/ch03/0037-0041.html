</P>

<P>Windows applications can also contain menus. This makes a Java application behave
like most other Windows-based programs (see fig. 3.4).
</P>

<P>There are two disadvantages to windows applications. The first problem is the
windows themselves. Having a window on the screen may not be desired for some applications
that require no user input or need to display status. Applications that only display simple
text should be written as console applications.

Console Applications

<P>Console applications are executed from the command line. No windows are opened 
and all communication to the user is accomplished with System methods, such as

console applications have few security restrictions placed on file or network access (see fig. 3.5).<BR>

Client/Server Applications
</A></H4>

<P>A client is a program that uses another program (usually running on another machine)
to perform functions. A server, simply defined, is a software application that
performs

</P>

<P>functions at the behest of a client application. The goal is to centralize common data
and tasks on the server, while client-specific data and functions are performed on the
client's machine (see fig. 3.6).
</P>

<P>There are many different ways of implementing client/server applications. The
following sections briefly describe most of the current alternatives.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 15">
Socket-to-Socket Applications
</A></H4>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-39"><P>Page 39</P></A>


<P>In the socket-to-socket model the client talks to the server via a socket stream. The
server and client code can be written in any language that supports streams. This is discussed
in detail in Chapter 9, &quot;Input/Ouput: Using Streams.&quot;
</P>

<P><B>
Socket Communication from Java Clients to CGI on a Server
</B></P>

<P>In this model, the client talks to the server via a socket stream on an HTTP server.
The specific socket only communicates via the CGI protocol. CGI programs can be written
in most languages and currently do most of the specific server-side functions for web
sites. There are many CGI-based applications that already exist on many web sites. These
CGI programs perform a variety of tasks, from database access to form input. Java can use
CGI to communicate to a server to access files, databases, and other programs.
</P>

<P><B>
Servlets and Agents
</B></P>

<P>Servlets are Java applications that run on an HTTP server. Servlets are similar to
CGI applications, but they are cross-platform because of their Java environment. Servlets
can essentially do all the work that is now done by CGI programs, including the generation
of HTML text to browsers, form processing, and database access.
</P>

<P>Servlets can also be sent from the client and run on the server. The client-to-server
servlet model is often referred to as a software agent.
Software agents are built by the client to accomplish tasks on multiple servers or to roam from server to server until a task
is complete.
</P>

<P>A good example of a software agent is a web crawler agent. The web crawler agent is
sent to a HTTP server where it queries the local system for certain information held in
HTML pages. After the information is found, the agent sends the information back to the client.
</P>

<P>Software agents use less network bandwidth than simple HTTP queries and, unlike
CGI, can be tailored by the client to perform client-specific processing. Unfortunately,
software agents also require CPU and memory resources on the HTTP server.
</P>

<P>The current way to run servlets is through JavaSoft's HTTP server, Jeeves. Jeeves
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-40"><P>Page 40</P></A>


<P>performs the normal tasks of an HTTP server and additionally handles servlet
management, security, and communications. There is also a public domain HTTP server called
Jigsaw with similar features.
</P>

<P><B>
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)
</B></P>

<P>Java implements the Common Object Request Broker Architecture through the Java
IDL API. The Java IDL system enables you to define remote interfaces in the
interface definition language (IDL), which is an industry standard defined by the Object
Management Group (OMG). CORBA is becoming more important as more companies
release libraries of CORBA objects that can be used by developers.
</P>

<P>CORBA lets a program pass data to a CORBA object on another machine as if it were
just an object at the local machine. This client/server approach is at the object level rather
than at an application level.
</P>

<P>The mapping from IDL to Java is defined in the Java IDL language mapping
specification defined by JavaSoft. The idlgen program, JavaSoft's IDL stub generator tool, is used
to generate Java interface definitions and Java client and server stubs. Along with
idlgen there is an IDL library used to access CORBA objects.
</P>

<P>CORBA and IDL are best suited for Java applications that require access to
CORBA objects. CORBA can also be used to interface distributed legacy applications to Java code.
</P>

<P><B>
Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Object <BR>
Serialization
</B></P>

<P>The Remote Method Invocation API and the Object Serialization API are classes
utilities and rules that allow a developer to create and access objects running on separate
machines. This is similar to CORBA except that it is pure Java. It is also similar to
the socket-to-socket model except that access is done by calling functions rather than
encoding and decoding a data stream. RMI still uses a stream, but all of the encoding
and decoding is done by serializing objects.
</P>

<P>Using the RMI model, a client and a remote object interact with each other by
sending serialized object data across a network. This type of client/server model should
be relatively easy for Java developers to use.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-41"><P>Page 41</P></A>


<P>RMI can be used in any application that communicates across a network to other
Java applications. The RMI API is used in Jigsaw and Jeeves to control servlets.
</P>

<P><B>
Transmitter/Receiver (Castinet)
</B></P>

<P>Castinet, from Marima, is a new distribution model that applies the transmitter
and reciever concepts of radio and television to the distribution of software and data.
</P>

<P>The transmitter is a Java application that runs on a server or multiple servers. It
distributes Java applications to receivers on other machines via a network.
Receivers are Java programs running on client machines that receive Java applications from
transmitters. After an application is received, it is run localy in the Java VM. Each application is
given access to its own file space but not to the entire machine, reducing security problems.
</P>

<P>Each time a user runs an application, the version on the transmitter is checked to
determine whether a new copy is available. If the user agrees, the new copy is downloaded
to the client's machine.
</P>

<P>This technology is important because it automates the distribution of software and
data, which is very important due to the slow speeds and volatility of the World Wide Web.
</P>

<P>In addition to transmitters and receivers, there are repeaters. A
repeater is used to distribute applications and data from a source transmitter to another server. This
secondary server becomes a transmitter of identical content of the original transmitter. This
concept is similar to mirror sites. Mirror sites are used to reduce the bottleneck of muliple
users attempting to access a single machine for content. The advantage of repeaters is
that content is automatically updated.
</P>

<P>The transmitter/receiver model supports distribution through a concept called
channels, which are data or programs that a user tunes to with the reciever. For instance, the
user tunes to the document editor to receive the program or to execute the local copy.
To retrieve data, the user could tune to the stock exchange to receive either a summary of
the day's events or live data feed.

Java Blocks: Classes, Interfaces, and Packages

<P>Java uses classes, interfaces, and packages to organize a program's structure. Using
these constructs, Java programs can be written in an object-oriented structure. The
