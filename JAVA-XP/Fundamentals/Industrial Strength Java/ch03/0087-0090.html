<P>Listing 3.30 shows class Pawn from the previous example
with some of the javadoc tags added. Note the asterisk on each line of
the comment. This asterisk is required by javadoc to find the

javadoc Output
</A></H4>

<P>The results of javadoc are four or more files. There are three files that are always
generated.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     The first file is AllNames.html, which contains an index of all the names
of classes, methods, and fields for the documented classes.
<LI>     The next file, tree.html, which contains a tree layout of the classes. The tree is
also hypertext-enabled so that it can be used to navigate to the class
descriptions themselves.
</UL>

ZIP Files
</H3>

<P>ZIP files can be used to hold collections of Java classes. The style of ZIP file that the
Java class loader accepts represents the full file name, has no compression turned on,
and contains directory information.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 34">
ZIP File in the CLASSPATH
</A></H4>

<P>In order to use ZIP files for applications, the ZIP file must be listed in the CLASSPATH
as a fully qualified directory and file name. For instance, if the standard Java ZIP file is
listed in c:\java\lib\classes.zip, then the CLASSPATH must be .;c:\java\lib\classes.zip.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 35">
ZIP Files from HTTP Servers
</A></H4>

<P>Since the introduction of Netscape Navigator 3.0, you can specify an uncompressed
.zip file as an addition to the code base of your application. By specifying a ZIP file,
the browser will load your applet's classes from a specified ZIP file before it searches
the code base.
</P>

<PRE>
&lt;APPLET archive=&quot;zipfile.zip&quot; CODE=&quot;myclass&quot;&gt;
</PRE>

<P>This ZIP can improve applet download time by reducing the number of HTTP
connections required to fetch applet code. This could save time when network connectivity is slow.
As an added benefit, Netscape caches the single ZIP file so that it will not reload your
applet unless the date of the ZIP file has changed.
</P>

<P>This could be a disadvantage only if you have a large application and if a user
accesses only a few of the many classes. Using a single ZIP file causes the user to load the
whole application, when only part is required. You can avoid this problem by loading a ZIP
file with only the classes that are frequently used, while keeping rarely accessed files in
your code base.
</P>

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>It is now even more important that your design is accurate, flexible, and robust.
Competition is everywhere on the World Wide Web, so you need a design that is easy to extend
and debug. It must be more reliable and resistant to crashes or catastrophic errors. Simply
put, your software needs to be held to the highest standards of planning, design, and
development.
</P>

<P>This chapter covers many of the pre-development issues that affect how you design
an application. Also introduced is the idea of incremental delivery&#151;a simple procedure
of obtaining requirements from customers and incrementally developing applications
with less effort and reduced development risks.
</P>

<P>Many of the language features of Java have also been covered with an emphasis on
how they relate to the object-oriented framework. Also exposed are some good design
techniques such as observers and object decoupling. Important information in the
chapter discusses how to avoid design problems such as inheriting from classes with
static variables.
</P>

<P>Finally, this chapter provided some information about how to use javadoc and ZIP files
to help you deliver your application.
</P>

<P>You are now well on the way toward writing advanced applications in Java.
