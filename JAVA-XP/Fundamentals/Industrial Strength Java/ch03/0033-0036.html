The Applet
</A></H4>

<P>Applets are a common way of writing Java applications. Integrating web-based sound
and graphics into applications is simplified by using methods in the Applet class. Applets
are essentially programs that run from within a web browser. They appear as a part of
HTML documents in the same way that pictures are presented. The major difference is
that instead of a static graphic, the Java applet is a complete running program. An applet is
just like a window application, but without a classic window frame. The range of
programs that

<A NAME="PAGENUM-34"><P>Page 34</P></A>


<P>can be written as an applet are reduced because of security limitations imposed by
the target browser.
</P>

<P>Applets only run from within Java-enabled browsers such as Netscape, Hot Java,
and Internet Explorer. This means that a user's machine must have a properly
configured browser to execute Java applets. Because more users have these browsers, even
within corporations, the number of potential users is growing quite large.
</P>

<P><B>
The Applet Class
</B></P>

<P>In order for a Java program to be an applet, the starting class for the application
must inherit from the Applet class. The Applet class is very useful because it contains
methods that make accessing the Internet very easy. The following sections detail specific
applet class methods of which you should be aware.
</P>

<P><B>
getDocumentBase()
</B></P>

<P>The getDocumentBase() method retrieves the directory from which your applet
was loaded. This could be on your local machine or an HTTP server. This function is used as
a base point for opening streams, loading pictures with getImage(), or playing sounds
with play(). From the document base, any subdirectory and file can be specified.
</P>

<P><B>
start(), stop(), and destroy()
</B></P>

<P>These three methods are called when the applet starts, stops, or gets destroyed. If
the applet needs to know when any of these actions occur, they must overload in the
main class, and specific code must be added.
</P>

<P><B>
getParameter() and getParameterInfo()
</B></P>

<P>These two methods provide access to the Applet parameter tags. This enables you
to perform the equivalent of command-line options. The getParameter() method retrieves
a specific parameter. getParameterInfo() returns an array of strings describing the
parameters that are understood by this applet.
</P>

<P><B>
getImage()
</B></P>

<P>The getImage() method loads a JPEG or GIF image that is displayable on the
Applet's panel.
</P>

<P><B>
getDocumentBase()
</B></P>

<P>The getDocumentBase() function is used to determine the base directory from which
to
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-35"><P>Page 35</P></A>


<P>load sounds and images. For applets loaded from an HTTP server, the document base
is the root directory from which the applet is allowed to access. The applet cannot
access directories below this point for security reasons. For example, an applet loaded from
/documents/myJava could load images from /documents/myJava/images but could
not load any files from /documents/personal.
</P>

<P><B>
getAudioClip() and play()
</B></P>

<P>These methods enable your applet to play sound files. GetAudiClip() loads a clip into
an AudioClip class that can be played later. The play() method loads and plays in one step.
</P>

<P><B>
The Advantages of Applets
</B></P>

<P>There are several advantages to using applets. The most obvious is that you only need
one copy of your production class files on an HTML server. This reduces the nightmare
of distributing and installing software by tape or disk. Internet and intranet-based
software also reduces the problems of LAN access to software. Instead of accessing a disk by
way of a network mounted disk (not always possible between departments or
company divisions) files are accessed through HTTP and FTP.
</P>

<P>Web pages can also be used as a method of presenting help to your users as well
as keeping them informed about the latest changes to your programs. This enables you
to keep in constant touch with your users.
</P>

<P><B>
The Disadvantages of Applets
</B></P>

<P>Running your application from a web browser is not necessarily a good thing. Target
users must be running a version of a web browser that supports Java. It also helps if users
have an Internet connection of 28.8K or higher on relatively fast computers.
</P>

<P>Another large problem is local file access. If the applet was loaded from an HTTP
server, no local files can be read or written to on the client's machine. This can be alleviated
by loading the applet from the user's local disk storage, but this defeats many of the
web-based applet advantages mentioned earlier.
</P>

<P>Applets have reduced network access. If an applet is loaded from a networked
machine, only that machine can be communicated with via a socket connection. This prevents
the applet from communicating to other machines on the web. This security restriction
is alleviated if the applet is loaded from the user's local disk.
</P>

<P>Applets may have reduced memory access. From within a web browser there may be
a limitation on the memory space that applets are allowed to access. If the application uses
a large amount of memory, developers must force users to modify options in their
web
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-36"><P>Page 36</P></A>


<P>browser before they can run the applet. Also some browsers may not support
JVM memory environment changes, if it does at all.
</P>

<P>Another, relatively new disadvantage of Java is the control over thread priority. The
latest version of the Netscape Navigator 3.0b6 does not allow applets to change
priority. Netscape created this security enhancement to prevent applets from changing priorities
to a point where they take over the machine and prevent other functions from running.
</P>

<P>Applets have a limited capability to communicate information to a host machine.
Host communication is required for saving data or controlling host software. To
currently achieve this, there must be cooperating software on the HTTP server. For more
information on these options, refer to the section on client/server applications that follows.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 11">
Stand-Alone Java Applications
</A></H4>

<P>Java applications are similar to running an applet from within a web browser. Instead
of running in a virtual machine supplied by the browser, the application executes in a
stand-alone version of the Java VM. The application also is loaded from the local file
system. Because it is assumed that users loaded the application to the local file system, there
are fewer file and network security restrictions imposed.
</P>

<P>An important advantage for large applications is that the memory space can be
controlled. From the Java JVM you can control initial limits for the stack and heap. If your
application uses a large amount of memory, you will have complete control of these settings.
</P>

<P>Stand-alone applications must also provide their own connection to resources, such
as pictures and sound. With applets, the connections are provided through the Applet class.
</P>

<P>The other problem with windows applications is that they do not run from web
browsers. As was discussed previously, the web browser reduces problems with delivering
applications by making them available on HTTP servers.
</P>

<P>It is possible to launch this type of application from an icon. You have the option
of running with a console window or without. To launch with a console, use the
standard Java VM. To launch without a console, use javaw.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 12">
Windows Applications
</A></H4>

<P>Windows applications are similar to running an applet from within a web browser.
The main difference is that there are fewer file and network security restrictions.
Stand-alone Windows applications must also provide their own connection to resources such
as pictures and sound.
