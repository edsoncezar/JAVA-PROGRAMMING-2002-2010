Planning Your Application

</H2>

<P>This chapter covers the Java-specific issues of planning applications. Planning is
often overlooked as a step in the design process. Planning should not be confused with
design. Design is the mechanics of creating an application.
Planning is how you decide what to design. Planning includes understanding the following:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What is needed? The problem domain and its requirements. Understanding
these goals and priorities creates a framework that the application will be designed
to meet.
</P>

<P>What is possible? The technology mapped to the problem. What's &quot;possible&quot; <BR>
is the technology at hand. Technology is the development environment,
code libraries, and the staff creating the application. The technology is the context
in which the design is built and the building blocks that are pulled from the shelf
or designed from scratch.
</P>

<P>What is easier? The easily implemented features, either by their nature or
because of the technology. Understanding what is easy can be used to set priorities of
easy functions early in a project to give the application the most utility as quickly
as possible.
</P>

<P>What is harder? Features requiring the most design and coding. By
understanding what is hard, risks and the critical functions can be planned for.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-22"><P>Page 22</P></A>


<P>These four basic questions, when understood for a particular application, can be used
to create the design and implementation details required for programming the
application. Not knowing the answers can lead to failure. For instance, not understanding
requirements leads to creating the wrong application. Not knowing what is possible could lead to
a design that is impossible. Not knowing what is easy can lead to doing what is hard
while never implementing what could be easily implemented and in use far before the
hard functions are ready.
</P>

<P> Without thorough planning you may be faced with a great deal of functional, but
ultimately useless, code. This chapter's purpose is to cover how to answer the questions
and to put them into the context of Java programming techniques and limitations. The
following subjects are covered:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>     Evaluate pre-development issues, which affect how you start designing, such as
the problems and benefits of network based-computing.
<LI>     Learn the mechanics of specific Java language features and how to use them
to create better applications.
<LI>     Discover how Java incorporates the object-oriented design model discussed in
the previous chapter. Lots of code and Booch diagrams are included to help
you visualize the object-oriented structure of Java.
<LI>     Become knowledgeable about delivery issues such as ZIP files and the
basic features of the Java Documentation utility.
</OL>

<P>This information not only helps you write better Java programs, but it can also help
you complete successful applications.
</P>

Java, the Web, and Intranets: The New Programming Environment
</A></H3>

<P>Java brings us a new way of creating applications, although it is not quite a
revolutionary leap forward. Nonetheless, Java represents a large step toward a better way of
programming. Compared to C++, the previous language of choice for object-oriented
programming, Java has many advantages:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>C++: Pointer arithmetic is unsafe, with no bound checking or validation that
pointers are accurate.
</P>

<P>Java: No pointers or pointer arithmetic. References are used to access objects.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-23"><P>Page 23</P></A>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>C++: Arrays in C++ are unsafe and code could run off the ends.
</P>

<P>Java: Arrays cannot overflow without trapping.
</P>

<P>C++: Complex syntax with C roots (for compatibility to legacy C code).
</P>

<P>Java: Language designed from scratch. Syntax similar to C and C++ only to
               reduce the learning curve of existing programmers. Many rarely used C++
             features removed to reduce language complexity.
</P>

<P>C++: Casting is not validated.
</P>

<P>Java: Casting between types is only valid between compatible types.
</P>

<P>C++: Threads are implementation dependent and not part of the language.
</P>

<P>Java: Threads are integrated into the language and into the Java VM.
</P>

<P>C++: GUI is vendor or platform dependent.
</P>

<P>Java: One GUI model for all platforms, the AWT.
</P>

<P>C++: Libraries performing the similar functions are usually not standard between
               vendors.
</P>

<P>Java: Popular libraries have standard APIs. APIs are used by all vendors.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Java may not double production time or eliminate bugs, but generally, experienced
Java developers are more productive than C++ programmers. Java programmers don't need <BR>
to worry about cleaning up memory or platform dependencies because Java has
friendly features, including garbage collection, standard libraries, networking, multitasking,
and cross-platform compatibility. Java also eliminates many common bugs, such as
arrays going out of bounds and misbehaving pointers.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 3">
The Internet
</A></H4>

<P>The Internet has created a whole new way of thinking about software and users. Many
of the changes have improved the delivery of software. Before the Internet, there was a
long process that had to be executed before a program could reach users. Many of these
tasks have been shortened or eliminated as the list below shows:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     Software can be delivered in minutes instead of days or weeks.
<LI>     New versions can be distributed to every user as they are released.
<LI>     Bug fixes can be delivered to all users immediately.
<LI>     No disks need to be copied.
</UL>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-24"><P>Page 24</P></A>


<UL>
<LI>     No packages need to be shipped.
<LI>     No manuals need to be printed.
<LI>     Inventory of old versions does not need to sell before releasing a newer version.
</UL>

<P>The networks have problems too. A new list of problems must be overcome.
Network environments have a distinct disadvantage because communication is so quick and
easy that new problems occur while classic problems become frequent occurrences.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     The cycle between new versions can be days or weeks rather than years.
Users want the latest technology today, not tomorrow.
<LI>     The competition is on the same virtual shelf at the electric shopping mall.
Marketing may be half of your development cost.
<LI>     Users may report bugs to everyone on the net. Damage and rumor control
becomes an everyday occurrence.
<LI>     Users expect bugs to be fixed sooner. Even during holidays.
<LI>     The competition can watch every move you make&#151;and counter them faster
than ever before.
</UL>

<P>These challenges are difficult, but they can all be handled if you are aware that they <BR>
are there. Plan to deal with them because they will eventually affect you. Unexpected <BR>
problems can still be corrected.
</P>

<P>The most important part of this new mode of business is
user support. Customers have much more influence than ever before. Customers can complain to thousands of
other customers and your potential customers, simply by posting a message to a news group
or writing their experiences on their web page. There are also consumer-oriented web
pages where individuals publish information about a range of products. The information
that gets to the web depends on how well you satisify customers, both through good
products and good support.
</P>

<P>You must be very responsive to user problems. Your support also needs to be
concerned with how customers are handled. The worst words a user support representative can
ever use are &quot;I don't know.&quot; Better ones are, &quot;I don't know, but I'll find out and get back to
you ASAP!&quot; To do otherwise could quickly degrade customer loyalty and possibly
generate bad press on the web.
</P>
