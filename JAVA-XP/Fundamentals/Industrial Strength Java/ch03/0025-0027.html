Intranet Software
</A></H4>

<P>Intranets are like the Internet, except that an intranet network is comprised only of
the interconnections within a corporation. Because the intranet is within the corporation,
the network has access to corporate resource's databases, as well as much better
network speeds than can be had through a 28.8 modem. The network can be made secure to
the outside world, which is very important when secure data flows across the network.
</P>

<P>Corporate intranets are usually made of different brands and models of computers.
Each computer has its own software and sometimes dissimilar hardware features. In
other words, corporate intranets are a mix of dissimilar computers. Because of the
hardware mix, a mix of software is needed to run these machines, as well. This mass of software
and hardware has become a large and expensive part of a corporation's operating budget.
</P>

<P>The total cost for software in large corporations can be huge. The types of
software include general office software, such as spreadsheets, editors, and scheduler tools. The
rest of the software consists of specialized programs that are oriented specifically to the
bus-     iness. Such software is either created in-house or by other companies on contract.
The software could be anything from petroleum-prospecting software used by oil companies <BR>
to special planning software used by telephone companies. General business and
specific industry or company software must be inexpensive to obtain or create, and inexpensive
to maintain.
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, because of multiple hardware platforms, software becomes expensive
to maintain. The solution is a corporate intranet and software written in Java. Many
companies have diverse networks of varying brands of hardware and operating systems.
Using Java to write a single cross-platform application for every computer in the
corporation greatly reduces in-house development costs. In addition, many in-house software
programs are unavailable to users in other departments because of network
incompatibility. Now, the intranet is used to bridge the gap. Using Java to write a single Java
cross-platform application for every computer in the corporation can also greatly reduce <BR>
in-house development costs.

Libraries
</A></H4>

<P>Software projects that used to take years to write are quickly becoming out-dated.
Software can now be built by combining application-specific programming with
generic libraries. 
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-26"><P>Page 26</P></A>


<P>Many truly generic functions have been implemented by libraries, reducing
the time and work required to deliver complete applications. For instance, printing has
long been a major effort of many software development organizations. Just making an
application print on two different printers could be a significant stumbling block. Libraries
and operating system services such as the Windows printing system now enables
programmers to focus more energy on their specific applications.

<P>At this time, a Java developer's access to libraries is just starting to multiply. Java
cannot yet print in version 1.0, but third-party companies have implemented printing solutions
for some specific platforms. Sun's 1.1 version of Java supports generic printing. Sun also is
 developing API specifications for industry standard libraries, such as database access
and 3D graphics libraries. Some libraries, such as the Telephone Application Interface
(TAPI) and multimedia libraries, have only recently come into use.
</P>

<P>Because of the corporate commitment to Java, many companies are developing
libraries that implement Sun's APIs as quickly as possible. Before developing a project, it is
wise to survey the current state of these specifications and the libraries that are supplied by
Sun and third-party developers. These libraries help reduce the total code developers have
to design and write. For some applications, this could be the difference between a month
of development with libraries and several years without.

Design Goals and Incremental <BR>
Delivery
</A></H3>

<P>Determining exactly what you want your application to do and when you want to deliver
it to customers are important design considerations. A source of problems that can
affect delivery is the time wasted developing functions that the user does not need or are
too inadequate to use. Preventing this mismatch by creating applications that users want
and can use is accomplished with a design process called incremental delivery.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch03_ 7">
Incremental Delivery Design Model
</A></H4>

<P>Incremental delivery is a good way to both increase the success of an application
and reduce development risks. Incremental delivery starts when a customer makes a
specific 
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-27"><P>Page 27</P></A>


<P>request to a developer. Then the developer begins the design of a base application that
will perform the minimum functions required. The user can then verify that the base
meets everyone's expectations or give the developer information of the application's
short-comings. This process continues with the addition of new features, each verified
before the next is designed and built.

<P>Compare the steps in classic top-down design in figure 3.1 to the steps of
incremental delivery in figure 3.2. There are a few extra steps in incremental delivery, but an
important difference between the two is the loop that feeds information from users testing back
into the design. In top-down design the cycle, test, and redesign happens at the end of
development. Top-down code is designed and written before a customer can see it. In the
incremental delivery model, small, deliverable pieces are designed and delivered to users
for testing and possible use. The steps of incremental delivery are shown in figure 3.2.
</P>

<P>These two types of development are valid, but they have different outcomes. The
incremental delivery approach is better because the feedback loop of design, development, and
testing occurs multiple times, reducing the risk that an error was made in customer requirements
or in how developers interpreted the requirements. Top-down only
receives feedback after the design and development have been completed. You may need to modify or redesign a lot
of code because mistakes made to the basic design can affect most of the code written.
Incremental delivery proceeds in stages. Each stage creates a version of the application that
has increased functionality. For example, an editor design would have dozens of
functions targeted for the final design. The first incremental version would have just simple file
I/O and primitive text editing. Version 2 would implement cut and paste. Version 3 would
add font control. More versions are added until the application is considered complete.
Each function is added to the base application and delivered to the user for testing or actual use.
</P>

<P>The incremental delivery process is very accurate.The user is periodically validating
the current state of the product. Users can determine quickly when a feature may be
incorrect or not as originally envisioned. Developers benefit greatly from this process because
each step is verified or fixed before development continues. Problems are fixed in code
written in the past week instead of code that was written six months ago, as it would be with
top-down design. Incremental design also prevents designers from creating extra
functionality that may never be used. The user is always informed about what is going on so that
