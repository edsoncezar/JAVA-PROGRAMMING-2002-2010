Jeeves and Java Servlets

</H2>

<P>This chapter covers the newest aspect of Java networking&#151;servlets.
Servlets are the server-side equivalents of applets. They are Java programs designed to execute in
an environment provided by an HTTP server. Intended as a Java-style replacement
for Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs, servlets are supported as an
extension package to JDK 1.1 and use a Java-based HTTP server that implements the newly
defined Servlet API. Like applets, servlets can be automatically downloaded to the server,
and untrusted servlets run in a secured environment. Unlike applets,
servlets have no user interface and do not use the AWT classes. Servlets and applets are compared in table
16.1. In this chapter, you are introduced to the basic features of the Jeeves HTTP server
and learn how to construct your own servlets.

Introduction to Servlets
</A></H3>

<P>The obvious question since the introduction of Java and the HotJava browser with
its client-side applets has been this: What can Java do for the server side? Java
applets facilitate the addition of specialized functions, such as intelligent forms, to a web
page; developers may add custom processing functions to the server with the new Servlet
API definitions, which extend Java web server functionality.

Deficiencies of CGI
</A></H4>

<P>Most HTTP servers support the Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) to connect to external programs. This interface enables you to add custom processing functions to an
HTTP server. With CGI, HTTP servers can return not only static
documents, but they can supply dynamic contents generated by
CGI-compatible programs written in C, Perl, shell script, or many
other languages. HTML forms information that is generally processed
on the server using a CGI program. CGI programs can also
process tasks, such as updating server-based files, which are not possible
or practical using client-side techniques such as Java applets
or JavaScript. CGI programs receive information about the task
by means of environment variables or by reading input from
the program's standard input stream (stdin on Unix). They write
results to their standard output stream (stdout on Unix) which is returned
to the web client by the server.

<P>Although CGI is an important first step in the generation of
dynamic web content and HTML-controlled processing, it suffers in
two areas:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     Performance
<LI>     Security
</UL>

<P>Initiating a new operating system process is necessary to execute
the CGI program referenced in the HTTP request. This leads to
performance problems. Despite the proposal of various other
schemes&#151;such as FastCGI, which does more intelligent process
management, and server-specific APIs developed by Netscape and other
HTTP server vend
