<P>In this chapter you will incorporate the skills you learned in Chapter 5, &quot;AWT Basics,&quot; to <BR>
build a flexible component-based application framework. This framework consists of
a series of classes, that, when either imported or extended, enable you to build a
GUI rapidly. You will find this useful for both adding a GUI to an existing text-based
application and creating a new GUI application.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch06_ 2">
The Need for a GUI Framework
</A></H3>

<P>As you develop more applications, you spend considerable time building similar
GUIs. Although these GUIs may differ in function, most applications appear similar. By
encapsulating all GUI components into flexible, reusable classes, you allow yourself to
concentrate on developing the &quot;meat&quot; of the application.
</P>

<P>The maximization of back-end development time occurs for one major reason:
User-interface code basically remains the same from one application to another. This <BR>
characteristic hearkens to the 1980s when Apple Computer pioneered efforts to grant
all applications a common look and feel. The company published a series of
human-computer interface guidelines and asked all developers to follow them for consistency. As a result, <BR>
a user can sit down at virtually any application that conforms to user interface
standards and determine how to use the application in a relatively short time. By encapsulating
code that is often reused into extendible classes, you separate yourself from the drudgery
of implementing this code more than once.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-174"><P>Page 174</P></A>



<P>The implications of this framework reach into many areas. To
those individuals familiar with object-oriented programming, this
code fulfills the object-oriented promise of creating reusable
code. Individuals with a background in procedural programming
also should be excited by this.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch06_ 3">
Planning for the Future
</A></H3>

<P>This book's goal is to teach the object-oriented application
design process. This chapter begins by showing you how to design
this framework and ends with the actual implementation. Many
programmers become so eager to begin the application that they start
coding long before they are ready. Planning ahead ensures that your code
is completely reusable. Failing to plan before you begin
developing often leaves you with classes that&#151;although they might work
well in the original application&#151;are basically useless outside of
that application.
</P>

<P>This framework's design contains features required by all
applications. The following sections encapsulate them into classes
that don't require interaction from the programmer during the
design process. The developer extends the principle class to allow the
back-     end methods to merge with the GUI methods. The programmer
also builds into the framework a support for infinite extensibility. As
you work with the framework, in fact, you will develop a library
of classes that complement the framework in a manner that works
best with the general appearance your applications need. As an
added bonus, you can trade classes with other developers working with
the framework. If you design your additional classes correctly, you
can distribute them to individuals who are not working with the
framework but who still need access to its functions.

By referring to the back end of the application as
the &quot;meat&quot; of the application, I in no way attempt
to degrade the importance of the front end. This assumption,
in fact, could not be further from the truth. Applications with
a minimal (or awkward) user interface suffer even if they
are powerful. Even the simplest computers can frustrate
you enough as it is; making the situation worse does not further
the success of your application. Although UI work is
certainly important, it can appear to be similar across all
applications. Developing a framework that manages UI work
for you allows you to concentrate on the application's
function, not the user instructions.

<P>Brainstorm for a minute about the basic features every application must
support&#151;for example, pull-down menus, error dialogs, and standard dialog boxes. Then look closer
at the features most applications support&#151;for example, the ability to show an image in
a window of an unknown size. With these features in mind,  you can modify the
framework to allow further customization.
</P>



<P>An application must have support for pull-down menus. Individual applications
determine the extent to which you can implement these menus, but all applications must offer
File and Edit menus.
</P>

<P>The File menu must offer support for creating a new window, closing the current
window, saving the current file, and opening a previous file. Of course, the File menu also
should offer the ability to quit the application.
</P>

<P>The Edit menu must offer support for clipboard interaction (Cut, Copy, and
Paste). Although additional menu support is not necessary, it is often desirable.
</P>

<P>In addition to menu support, you must offer support for communicating with the user
via dialog boxes. Use this communication for one of the following reasons:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          To relay information to the user
<LI>          To ask a question of the user
</UL>

<P>Both modal and modeless dialog boxes require support in an application.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch06_ 5">
Starting the Application Framework
</A></H4>

<P>Developing a framework that is both basic enough for all applications and
powerful enough to make itself useful is not an easy task. If you implement features that are
too specific, the framework no longer serves all applications. However, if you do not
add enough features, the framework becomes essentially useless.
</P>

<P>All GUI applications must support menus, but the extent to
which you can implement menus varies within applications.
</P>

<P>You need not look much further than the previous chapter for
strong menu code. The FileFrame class from Chapter 5 offers support
for menus on a few levels, including the ever important File
menu. Almost all menu classes, however, are declared private. Because

<P>want classes that work with your framework to have the freedom
to modify away, it is crucial that all variables are publicly
accessible. You will therefore want to ensure that most classes in your
framework are declared public.
</P>



<P>After you determine that your menu code exists, and you identify needed
modifications, you can begin writing that portion of the framework. First, note the steps required to
make the transition from Chapter 5 menu code to the code used here:


<OL>
<LI>     Copy listing 5.6 into a new text window.
<LI>     Remove all code that implemented any menu other than the
         File menu.
<LI>     Add similar support for an Edit menu.
<LI>     Ensure that all classes are declared public.
</OL>

<P>Applying these steps to the FileFrame class from Chapter 5 provides the code fragment
in listing 6.1.
