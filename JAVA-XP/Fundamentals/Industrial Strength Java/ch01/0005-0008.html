<UL>
<LI>     An application that shows you how to use AWT components to build
complex screens
<LI>     An application that shows you how each layout manager deals with the same set
of components.
</UL>

<P>Both applications are interactive and not only show you the code required to 
implement the application, but how to choose between different components and
layout managers.
</P>

Chapter 6, &quot;Advanced AWT&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>This chapter expands upon the coverage of the AWT API package discussed in Chapter 5
It also taught you how to build a graphical user interface (GUI) application framework <BR>
that can be subclassed to provide an instant graphical front end to an existing
text-based application. You will find that the framework is a great starting point for new applications.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 10">
Chapter 7, &quot;Beginning Data Structures: Taking <BR>Advantage of java.util&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Data structures are the core of any application, and this chapter introduces them
painlessly through the use of the java.util package. The chapter covers what is provided by
the package and explains some slight modifications you can use to make preexisting
data structures act like others.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 11">
Chapter 8, &quot;Advanced Data Structures&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>This chapter moves beyond the basic data structures introduced in Chapter 7 and
covers building data structures from the ground up. This chapter addresses the enigma of the
lack of pointers in Java.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 12">
Chapter 9, &quot;Input/Output: Using Streams&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Chapter 9 is a class-by-class reference to the java.io package. This chapter teaches you
not only how to provide communication into and out of your application, but it instructs
how streams can be used for communication between applications.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 13">
Chapter 10, &quot;Introducing Networking&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Chapter 10 introduces one of the main features built into Java from day
one&#151;networking. This chapter discusses different networking protocols, and how they can be built
using 
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-6"><P>Page 6</P></A>


<P>Java. Additional coverage includes interaction with the Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) using HTTP-GET and HTTP-POST.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 14">
Chapter 11, &quot;Advanced Networking&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Understanding the minute details of an application that takes advantage of Java's
rich networking features is often the key to its success. This chapter expands on the
networking coverage found in Chapter 10 with the development of a complete server
framework written totally in Java. Additionally, you will learn how to build a complete e-mail
client and server application that uses the SMTP, POP, and HTTP protocols.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 15">
Chapter 12, &quot;Distributed Computing with <BR>Java&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Currently, many business solutions are built as client/server applications. This is
changing, however, and a &quot;new wave&quot; of computing is taking over. Distributed computing is
the process by which application tasks are spread out over multiple machines. This
chapter focuses on the Object Management Group's (OMG) CORBA standard for
distributed object technology.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 16">
Chapter 13, &quot;Thinking in Terms of Threading&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Regardless of which language you use, if execution time matters at all, you will need
to build a multithreaded application. Fortunately, this is easy in Java. Chapter 13
briefly introduces the syntax needed to write threaded code and delves into the details of how
and when to use threads in your application.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 17">
Chapter 14, &quot;Interfacing C/C++ and Java&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Although Java is much more fun to work with when compared to C++, the sad truth is
that there are times when a platform-specific language is needed. This occurs frequently
when some sort of direct-to-hardware communication is needed. This chapter shows you how
to build a library that enables a Java application to access serial ports on a Windows 95
or NT machine.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 18">
Chapter 15, &quot;Java Beans&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Java Beans, JavaSoft's component architecture for Java, has the potential to alter
the manner in which software is written. Code that complies with the Java Beans standard
is
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-7"><P>Page 7</P></A>


<P>benefited with increased reuse, a logical event model, and easier testing patterns.
This component architecture is the focus in Chapter 15.
</P>


<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 19">
Chapter 16, &quot;Jeeves and Java Servlets&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Chapter 16 focuses on JavaSoft's Jeeves Java-based web server, particularly on
the implementation of servlets. Of interest is the servelet implementation of popular
web CGIs, such as a shopping basket and a hit counter.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 20">
Chapter 17, &quot;JDBC&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Chapter 17 focuses on the Java Database Connectivity Standard, an API that
facilitates database integration in Java. This chapter is of huge interest to anyone wanting to
move from C++ to Java as a front end development tool.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch01_ 21">
Development of the Book
</A></H3>

<P>It goes without saying that there is a lot of material jammed into this book. It is
the product of a small team of developers getting together to produce a book we
ourselves have always wanted. Although the authors live in different parts of the world and
use different compilers on different machines, the final product is a highly polished piece of <BR>
work that applies to you regardless of compiler or platform choices.
</P>

<P>For the curious, a majority of the book was developed using Natural Intelligence's
Roaster on a PowerBook 5300cs. Other authors used every other platform and compiler
imaginable, from vi and the JDK on one level, to an IDE such as Symantec Caf&eacute; on another. Of <BR>
course, all examples were tested using the JDK as a reference.
</P>

<P>Enjoy and learn from this book! If you ever have any questions, feel free to e-mail me <BR>
at luke@luke.org. Please note that although I may not answer your question right away, <BR>
I will get back to you.
