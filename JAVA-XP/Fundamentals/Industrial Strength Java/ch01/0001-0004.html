Industrial Strength Java: <BR>For the Industry's <BR>
Strongest Developers

</H2>

<P>For the past 20 years, software prophets have been talking about a mythical day when
all software will be capable of running on any computer without it being necessary to
make any modifications whatsoever. Developers bought into this idea with a hope that one
day they would wake up to find that their user base had increased ten fold! They could
then look at titles Egghead Software has to offer and not even bother to check whether they
run on their computer.
</P>

<P>This dream became a reality with the development of a new programming language
from Sun Microsystems called Java. When Java was in late beta form in late 1995, it
was implemented on very few platforms and was scarcely used to build applications.
</P>

<P>It is understandable why Java was embraced by developers. It came at a time when
the web's popularity was growing exponentially and when developers were looking for
an answer to the ever-growing problem created by a diverse platform environment. It
is completely amazing how this language was embraced so completely by
developers. Programmers rarely change development languages; this is one of the main reasons
there are so many COBOL programmers.
</P>

<P>Developers usually find a language that they like and then stick with it. After Java
was announced, developers using C++ or Smalltalk ran like lemmings to Java. In fact, Java
has even made the move from geekdom to mainstream, and not only are people moving
from C++ to Java, but many developers now choose Java as their first language.
</P>

<P>Despite Java's versatility, there are few business solutions currently in existence that
have been developed in Java. In fact, most of the language's publicity has come from
glorified animated GIFs, which amount to nothing more than bandwidth-wasting applets. This is <BR>
all very interesting considering it is business solutions (such as database front ends
or spreadsheets) that often prove a language. However, solutions being written in Java
are increasing, and with the help of this book, you may be among the first people to
develop real-world solutions entirely in Java.

The Industrial Strength Reading Audience
</A></H3>

<P>The Industrial Strength series at New Riders is catered toward intermediate to
advanced developers. As an intermediate Java developer, you should already know most of
the language's syntax and have developed a few applets and applications. This book
is designed to take you beyond this point by providing you with discussions of
advanced Java topics. After all, if you're looking at this book, you know that Java is the
coolest language out there, but, unfortunately, you need to convince your boss of this before he
or she will let you develop in Java. This book not only provides you with fodder for
you boss, but it shows you what it means to develop full-force applications in Java.
</P>

<P>Computer books often focus only on the actual coding process of an application
but neglect to discuss the planning stages involved. How many times have you looked at
a piece of code and said, &quot;Oh, well that makes sense now that I see it. I would have
never thought of that myself though.&quot; Industrial Strength
Java  not only shows you an appli-     cation's finished code, it discusses application design. And yes, if you flipped though
this book, those are Booch diagrams you saw!
</P>

<P>Industrial Strength Java serves a dual purpose. The first is to educate you about
real-world software development in Java. Here you will want to clear off your calendar and curl up
in front of your computer with this book. In addition to teaching you about development
in

<P>Java, this book is designed to serve as that one reference that sits on your lap while
you code. This is not to say that you will find the same annotated API that is featured in
every other book on Java, but rather you will find detailed instructions on how to use
different aspects of Java in various situations.
</P>

The Focus of the Book
</A></H3>

<P>As was stated at the beginning of this chapter, Java owes much of its fame to silly
bandwidth-wasting applets. Although this &quot;applet craze&quot; did a tremendous service to
the language by propelling it into the developer community, the craze has also given
the language a bad name.
</P>

<P>Many people feel that Java is great for spicing up web sites, but it can never compete
with C++. To counter this belief, this book is designed to show you how Java is capable
of producing business solutions. These solutions are almost all applications, and you
will find very little applet code in this book.
</P>

<P>This, of course, is not to say that applets are meaningless garbage because there are
many examples of companies that have a totally applet-based intranet. Applets do have a
great distribution model, and, in many situations, they are the best way to solve a
problem. However, applets suffer due to a draconian security sandbox. This &quot;security sandbox&quot;
 keeps users safe, but it makes developers jump through hoops when building
complex applications.
</P>

<P>If you are using Java to develop applets, this book is a great resource for you. The book
is not limited to the larger topic of application development. If you are using the book as
an applet developer, however, note that some code presented may violate the security
sand-     box. If this is the case, adaptations to the material may be necessary. You should note
that code signing will probably become common soon, resulting in the need for a
config-     urable security manager. Chapter 4, &quot;Applets,&quot; discusses applet development in
greater detail, including a discussion of how you can develop powerful applications within
the security sandbox.

Contents of the Book
</A></H3>

<P>Developing a book about a topic as large as business solutions in Java is not an easy
task. You have what professionals in the field consider to be 1,000 pages of the most
important, available material. However, were we given the time (and trees), we could have
written volumes on this topic.
</P>

<P>The topics that today's professional Java developers feel are the most important in the
Java environment are outlined in the chapter descriptions that follow.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 5">
Chapter 2, &quot;Object-Oriented Programming&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>If it has been a while since you last wrote code in an object-oriented language,
use Chapter 2 as a jump-start. This chapter discusses the most important step in
application development&#151;design. Chapter 2 focuses on what it means to design applications from
an object-oriented perspective.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 6">
Chapter 3, &quot;Planning Your Application&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Chapter 2 provides the framework for Chapter 3, which gets into the nitty-gritty details
of application development. This chapter looks at Booch diagrams as planning tools
and discusses the different forms that your code can take.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch01_ 7">
Chapter 4, &quot;Applets&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>Chapter 4 examines applet development in Java. Topics of interest in this chapter
include the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     Taking advantage of the applet distribution model
<LI>     Surviving within the security sandbox
<LI>     Applet-specific methods and related HTML references
</UL>

Chapter 5, &quot;AWT Basics&quot;
</A></H4>

<P>This chapter is an indispensable resource to the AWT API package. In this chapter,
two applications are developed:
