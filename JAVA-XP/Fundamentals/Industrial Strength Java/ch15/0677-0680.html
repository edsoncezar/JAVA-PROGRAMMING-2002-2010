Java Beans

</H2>

<P>Undoubtedly, the computer industry is among the most quickly evolving industries. <BR>
Consider the explosion of new languages and ideas appearing every day. These
new approaches seem to change even faster than the latest fashions. Today, one of the
biggest trends is the component movement. As such, the Java programming language is
jumping on that bandwagon with Java Beans component architecture. This chapter covers
the following topics to help you understand what Java Beans is and what it does.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     What is a component?
<LI>     Java Beans component architecture
<LI>     Java Beans basics
<LI>     Developing AWT Beans
<LI>     Java 1.1 as it affects Java Beans
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="ch15_ 2">
Using Components
</A></H3>

<P>In an attempt to simplify programming and reduce the average size of
applications, developers are moving toward component development. A
component is a chunk of code that has the capability to function both independently and interactively by working
with other components. By conforming to an agreed standard, developers can reuse
components that were produced by other developers at different points in time and in
different places in the world.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-678"><P>Page 678</P></A>


<P>End users also benefit by combining only the components that they require. For
example, suppose Microsoft Word were component-based; users requiring only basic word
processing functionality could simply install those components. Additionally, in cases where
the user requirements change (suppose that a user needs Word's collaborative
document functionality), then these components may be easily incorporated into the Word directory.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch15_ 3">
Benefits to the Developer
</A></H4>

<P>To a developer, components may be the best thing since sliced bread. Today's
companies release new versions of their software almost monthly, due in part to large
development teams; however, reuse of code is largely responsible for this rapid release of
updated versions. Object-oriented programming (OOP) contributes to code reuse.
Unfortunately, the unique coding styles of each developer pose difficulties. It is rare that one
developer's code is easily reused by another developer.
</P>

<P>The standardization of component architecture enables the reuse of components among
a theoretically infinite number of developers. By being able to take advantage of a
multitude of pre-existing components, development time shrinks dramatically. For example, a
small e-mail application that normally requires a set of classes for SMTP communication
could efficiently reuse existing SMTP components.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch15_ 4">
Benefits to the Consumer
</A></H4>

<P>Software purchases are some of the largest costs to any shop. One thousand licenses of
a typical software product can be very expensive&#151;and they might be required by
everyone in your shop. And to make the cost worse, a shop often purchases a product that
contains superfluous features that the shop doesn't even need.
</P>

<P>For example, a basic calculator with five functions (+, -, *, /, square root) can be
purchased for $5. For around $80, you can buy a complex graphing calculator, which <BR>
contains many unnecessary features. Consumers wanting only a couple of
advanced functions (such as the sine and cosine functions) are forced to purchase the more
expensive product. A component-based product solves this problem by enabling the client
to purchase a customized application with only the desired components.
</P>

<P>Returning to the example of Microsoft Word, most licenses of Word are used for
basic word processing. In fact the most advanced feature used by most people is the
spell checker. Although there are some &quot;power&quot; users of Word&#151;people who use many of
the more complex and obscure features&#151;they are rare compared to your average user.
Unfortunately, because there is only one application, everyone has to buy the same product.

The Java Beans Component <BR>
Architecture
</A></H3>

<P>Although it is a big help that components are based on standards,
it is too much to hope for that there would be only one standard.
The focus of this chapter is one of JavaSoft's component architecture
for Java; the Java Beans component architecture.
</P>

<P>Java Beans is part of Java 1.1 and takes advantage of many of
its new features, including the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     Communication via a delegation-based event model
<LI>     Introspection
<LI>     Serialization
<LI>     The JAR file format
</UL>

<P>It is easy to become overwhelmed when you look over the
concepts listed. What is imporant to remember is that although those
features are required of advanced Bean development, mastery is not a prerequesite to general
Bean development. A basic understanding of the delegation based event model is, in fact, all
that is needed to begin developing your first Bean.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch15_ 6">
The Java 1.1 Delegation-Based Event Model
</A></H4>

<P>One of the most radical changes to Java 1.1 is the
delegation-based event model, which is much different from a the one used in Java 1.0.
</P>

<P>Events in Java 1.0 communicate in a &quot;hierarchical&quot; event model. If an
event occurs in a given component, that event travels up the component hierarchy originating at the
component that generates it. The event continues up until it reaches an action() or
handleEvent() method that returns true.
</P>

<P>This event model becomes very cumbersome for the following reasons:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     If your application needs to respond to an event that occurs in a given
component, it is usually necessary to subclass the component. This can generate an
unwieldy sea of class files.
</UL>

This chapter uses &quot;Beans&quot; as a singular noun. The name
&quot;Java Beans&quot; refers to the component
architecture, which is singular. Therefore, it is
grammatically correct to say &quot;A Java
Beans architecture helps reduce development time.&quot;

<UL>
<LI>     Communication between components at different levels of the component
hierarchy involves unnatural, messy coding.
<LI>     Embedding the event handling so deep within the application results in an
application that is tightly integrated with its GUI. Making changes to the GUI,
therefore, means a lot of code rework.
<LI>     Because locating the event source is usually based on comparisons to a
string passed as a parameter, localization becomes a lengthy process.
</UL>

<P>In the delegation-based event model in Java 1.1, an object designates itself as a
&quot;listener&quot; to another object. When an event occurs in that &quot;other&quot; object, the event is broadcast to
all listeners. This correctly implies that an event propagates directly from the source to
its listeners. Refer to figure 15.1 for an illustration of this.

Figure 15.1 Comparing the Java 1 and Java 1.1 Event Models.
</P>

<P>In the figure, an event travels through a system using the Java 1.0 event model (left)
and the Java 1.1 event model (right). It is important to note that although both models
embody an object hierarchy, only the Java 1.0 model propagates events up the hierarchy.
