<P>Listing 7.13b contains the getIndex() method that locates the index (in our list) of

an object.

<PRE>

      //returns the index of the object passed in. Since we have knowledge

      //of the distribution, we are able to eliminate many elements where

            //searching.

            //is the needed index past the midpoint?

            if(theInt.intValue() &gt;= middleValue) {

            return super.find(theInt, 0);

<P>Finally, the remove() method is implemented in listing 7.13c.

            //calling a method which actually resides in Vector.

Summary

</A></H3>



<P>This chapter began to explore the core of an application, data structures. This chapter

did not, however, cover everything that you need to know to develop your own data

structures in Java. This chapter simply discussed the java.util package that provides some

elementary data structures. This package is great because it not only enables you to quickly

implement some common data structures (java.util.Stack), but also enables you to rapidly

create new data structures based on existing models. As you move on to Chapter 8, you will

learn how to create any data structure from the ground up in Java!
