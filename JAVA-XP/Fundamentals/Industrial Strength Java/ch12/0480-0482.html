Java and CORBA
</A></H3>

<P>Even before work started on the language which was to become Java, the issue of
creating interoperable distributed objects was a challenge facing the computer industry. A
key requirement was the creation of suitably open standards. In a rare show of unity,
several major industry players, Sun among them, came together to create such standards, and
in 1989 the Object Management Group (OMG) was born. In 1991 the group produced
the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) specification and in the
years since has been working continuously to both refine the specification and develop
a comprehensive distributed object architecture with CORBA as its cornerstone.
Currently the OMG's 600-plus membership reads like a &quot;Who's Who&quot; of the computer
industry, including IBM, HP, Novell, Apple, Oracle, CERN and Netscape. Given this level
of support, CORBA can be truly considered an industry standard.
</P>

<P>Sun has been developing the Java IDL tools, in parallel with RMI, to allow Java
objects and applications to interoperate with CORBA-compliant distributed objects. Java IDL
(a key aspect of CORBA) has not been shipped with JDK 1.1 because it is still
undergoing standardization by the OMG. However, like RMI, Java IDL is part of the Java
Enterprise API; it forms part of the core library API, which means developers can assume it will
be present on all Java implementations.
</P>

<P>The following sections provide some background on the OMG, a roadmap to the
comprehensive architecture they have defined, and some details on Java IDL itself, mainly
the proposed mapping between the IDL and Java languages.

The Object Management Group: Building a <BR>Standard
</A></H4>

<P>When the OMG was formed, a perceived weakness in the standards organizations of
the time, particularly those in the fields of telecommunications and computer languages,
was the length of time needed for a standard to be processed. In areas of rapid
development, standards tended to lag behind current technological capabilities. This caused
proprietary extensions to be adopted in the interim, resulting in a great waste of time and
money. Familiar examples are V34 modems and ANSI C where manufacturers were forced
to improvise until suitable standards emerged.
</P>

<P>Thus, the risk of a slow standardization process is the formation of de facto
standards, such as NetScape's influence on HTML. For a new standard to be adopted, it
generally has to be backward compatible with existing practice, which often means taking on
the &quot;baggage&quot; of previous de facto standards.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-481"><P>Page 481</P></A>



<P>Conversely, rapid standardization may be risky. Standards may be incapable of
meeting the needs of their audience because they were rushed out with insufficient thought
and consultation. Standards authoring is a most demanding activity; it is important to
involve as many interested parties with as much industry experience, intellectual firepower,
and political clout as possible. Meanwhile, the groups developing the specifications must
be organized so communication between authors is productive and efficient.
</P>

<P>To tackle these problems, the OMG aimed to &quot;fast-track&quot; standards, working in
cycles much shorter than those of existing organizations. To facilitate this, adoption of
existing approaches and standards was given priority.
</P>

<P>&quot;Fast tracking&quot; is relative of course; standardization is still measured in terms of
years. However, the OMG has been active for eight years and by drawing on the
extraordinarily wide pool of industry experience of its member organizations, their creation, the
Object Management Architecture (OMA), is the most technically credible vision for
distributed object computing currently available. The OMA is based on the following key principles:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Openness
<LI>          Heterogeneity
<LI>          Portability
<LI>          Interoperability
</UL>

<P>All of these are important for its widespread acceptance. Being open means that no
single company can manipulate the market place. Modern networked environments are
internally diverse, so a &quot;universal solution&quot; to which the OMG aspires must be applicable
to different communications protocols, with a range of implementation languages
across different operating systems, running on a range of hardware.
</P>

<P>The standard must also be sufficiently detailed so that different parts of a system
created by different parties can be seamlessly integrated.
</P>

<P>An interesting insight into the OMG's standardization process is provided by
Roger Sessions. As the coauthor of the Object Persistence Services, his 1996 book,
Object Persistence&#151;Beyond Object Oriented
Databases, describes not only the resulting
standard but the personal aspects and political wrangling leading to its adoption.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch12_ 24">
The Competition
</A></H4>

<P>Only one major software company of note has so far refused to involve itself with
the OMG&#151;Microsoft. Given its track record and corporate culture of competition
over cooperation, this is perhaps understandable. Microsoft has positioned its ActiveX
and Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) &quot;standards&quot; in opposition to CORBA.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-482"><P>Page 482</P></A>



<P>As a strategy for general distributed object computing, ActiveX/DCOM is technically
weak. It is based on Microsoft's GUI desktop technology &quot;OLE&quot; and is neither platform
nor language independent. The effect it might have on the field is a subject of hot
debate: Its parentage is to be weighed against its more proprietary and Windows-centric architecture.
</P>

<P>Currently DCOM is in its early stages. Only limited descriptions of how it
might interwork with Java objects are available so it won't be further discussed here.
The proposed DCOM &quot;standard&quot; is available on the Internet at

The Object Management Architecture (OMA)
</A></H4>

<P>Although CORBA is the best-known portion of the OMG's architecture, it is only
the bottom layer or core. CORBA provides the underpinnings for all the higher level
services and facilities which are necessary for  complex software systems. By providing
strong guidelines on how software can be structured, the OMA forms the basis of a new
generation of reusable software components and
systems.
</P>

<B>
The Reference Model
</B>

<P>The Reference Model acts as a &quot;road map&quot; for the OMA. It describes the major
components of the OMA and how they work together. It can be described approximately with
a layered model, with the most application-specific concerns (roughly corresponding to
the concept of componentware) at the top, and most general areas (such as object
communication) at the bottom. Table 12.1 illustrates the layered OMA Reference Model.
