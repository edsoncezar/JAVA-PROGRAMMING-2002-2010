<P>Consequently, corporations find the thin client model&#151;where a central, relatively
costly resource is leveraged across the whole user base&#151;very appealing. They perceive the
new dedicated Java machines, without local storage, as a direct replacement for the systems
of dumb terminals and mainframes currently deployed. Software is automatically
downloaded from a central source, making it easy to update. User data is stored
centrally, facilitating backups.
</P>

<P>At least initially, Java and CORBA solutions will fit this traditional client-server
model. Remote objects on the server will do most of the processing, whereas local objects
will present good-looking graphical user interfaces to the applications. Lightweight Java
ORBs can be downloaded with application software to perform the communication
functions; full ORBs are unnecessary because clients do not need to communicate directly.
Objects at the server end can be coded in an appropriate language, such as C or COBOL.
Legacy applications and databases can be given object-oriented interfaces, implemented as
bridges using CORBAS Dynamic Server Interface.
</P>

<P>This is the model best supported by the first wave of Java/CORBA tools (such
as OrbixWeb from Iona and JOE from Sun). As the tools mature, it is likely that
greater support for peer-to-peer arrangements of objects will be provided. Groupware
and workflow applications benefit most from these arrangements.
</P>

<P>Standardization of the IDL bindings for the Java language by the OMG is a critical
next step. It must happen before CORBA becomes a viable distributed computing
framework for Java, with strong third-party support. The standard is currently receiving a lot
of attention, with an expected end point around the second or third quarter of 1997. It
is likely that the final standard will be close to the one submitted by Sun Microsystems,
as supplied in the Java IDL distribution, and in online form on their web page at

<P>As much of an advance as it is, inter-object communication may still be at too low a
level of abstraction or granularity for tomorrow's applications. Distributed objects are just
one facet (albeit a major one) of component-oriented paradigms. To close out this chapter,
the next section covers Sun's proposal for a software component model, which
subsumes concerns over RMI or IDL by allowing either or both within its architecture.
</P>

Java IDL or RMI: The Java Beans Initiative
</A></H4>

<P>Java Beans is Sun's proposal for a component-level model for Java. Software
components address the granularity of software packaging. Traditionally, software has either been
sold as complete, monolithic applications or as low-level libraries for developers.
Components
</P>
<A NAME="PAGENUM-501"><P>Page 501</P></A>



<P>offer a higher level of functionality than most libraries, but lower than that of
applications, such as word processors. Such granularity is expected to promote reuse, while making
it easier to develop applications tailored to the needs of users (rather than the
one-size-fits-all approach of current application software).
</P>

<P>The Java Beans model is similar to existing models such as OLE/ActiveX and
OpenDoc. The model is based on containers and components, called Beans. Java Beans does
not itself address the distributed objects issue, but subsumes it by integrating the RMI
and Java/IDL approaches within its framework. Beans are not automatically turned
into distributed objects because this would impose inappropriate overhead in many
cases. Instead they are easily made into distributed objects using the appropriate
services. Likewise, existing APIs are used to support the following services:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          Persistence using Java Object Serialization
<LI>          Reflection using the Java Core Reflection API
<LI>          Packaging using the JAR file format
</UL>

<P>Beans have both run-time and design-time parts. At design time, the Bean provides
code to enable its handling in an application builder. Using the Reflection APIs (which
perform a similar function to the CORBA Interface Repository), the builder can discover all
the information it requires about the bean to support its integration into the application
being built. Complex Beans may provide their own editors as part of the design-time code.
</P>

<P>Many Beans will have a GUI component based on the AWT, though some
(especially those that run on servers) may be completely non-visual.
</P>

<P>Beans can even determine their context at run-time and exhibit visual or
non-visual behavior as appropriate. It is expected that most Beans will be small- to
medium-sized components, from buttons to more complex controls such as grids and text editors.

<P>Several companies, such as IBM, have also announced support for the Java Beans
model, integrating it with their existing OpenDoc technology.

<P>References to resources on the Internet have a habit of going out of date, even before
they are published in paper form, which is particularly true with the rapidly evolving field
of distributed objects. To help you explore the field beyond the overview given in
this chapter, a web page has been set up at

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>Networking is intrinsic to most visions of future computing. The technologies
behind distributed computing aim to hide the presence of the network, enabling developers
to create software without regard for where its objects will be eventually located. In use,
the objects are geographically distributed for best efficiency, while interoperating
seamlessly to give an illusion of locality to the user.
</P>

<P>Sun has provided two choices of distribution mechanism for Java objects. Remote
Method Invocation is an elegant, Java specific approach introduced with JDK 1.1. The
alternative Java IDL mechanism is based on the open CORBA2 standard from the Object
Management Group and caters to larger heterogeneous systems. Either can be used to provide
the underlying distribution capabilities to support the JavaBeans software component model.
