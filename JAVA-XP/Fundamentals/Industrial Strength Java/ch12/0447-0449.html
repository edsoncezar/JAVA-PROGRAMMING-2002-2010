Distributed Computing <BR>with Java

</H2>

<P>Widespread enthusiasm for Java is due in large part to the perception that it is a 
&quot;network-aware&quot; language with special Internet capabilities. However, its
real strength in this domain is its portability. By virtualizing a processor and environment,
it provides for platform-independent programs, able to execute anywhere within a
heterogeneous network. Prior to the release of version 1.1 of the Java Developer Kit (JDK),
Java itself did not address the wider issues of distributed computing, particularly those
related to communication between objects residing on different networked machines. These
are the issues covered in this chapter.
</P>

<P>Be forewarned, this chapter does not of necessity have quite the same pragmatic
approach as the previous ones; most of the discussion is focused on the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; of
Java technology, which&#151;although now officially released&#151;will still evolve as it is adopted
by mainstream developers and as any remaining shortcomings are exposed.
</P>

<P>However, despite its immaturity, Java support for true distributed computing is
extremely important. Distributed computing, with an emphasis on distributed objects, may
well become the dominant development paradigm in the near future. Current
applications, written with the assumption that they will always run within the confines of a
single machine, are always limited by the computing power available on a single machine and
do not scale well. By contrast, a distributed application can run on a single machine,
or several as appropriate, and so can take advantage of the increasing ubiquity of
networked computers to increase both performance and capacity.
</P>

<P>Distributed computing is not a new development and is based on more than a decade
of research and development. This chapter aims to acquaint you with the associated
mindset and the fundamental issues faced when moving from a single processor
environment, placing these in a historical context. It then discusses in some detail the two main
approaches supported by the JDK: the Java-specific Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
and the more heterogeneous Java/IDL CORBA support.
</P>

<P>Such support, coupled with Java's inherent portability, almost guarantees it a
preeminent role in this rapidly expanding field.

Distributed Computing
</A></H4>

<P>Computing involves bringing computer hardware and software resources to bear on a
set of information in order to solve problems for people. Taking a broad view,
distributed computing is not a niche area, but rather encompasses the whole of computing. The
case of a single computer running a program on some local data files and providing results to
a user is one end of a spectrum, which stretches out at the other extreme to multiple
users, networked machines, and information spread around the globe.
</P>

<P>It is a complex field, with a large number of forces and constraints making a
one-size-fits-all solution impractical. Each problem to be solved involves differently
distributed information, groups of people, and machines. Each situation has different forces at
work; economics is a major factor, but geography, performance requirements, integrity,
resilience, and availability also greatly affect the solution space.
</P>

<P>What's more, these forces change over time, often quite rapidly. Not only must a
distributed system meet initial requirements, it must be able to evolve gracefully to meet
future, often unpredictable, demands.
</P>

<P>Thirty years ago, computers were multimillion dollar resources, and the demand for
their services by researchers was rising. Rather than try to duplicate the expensive
machinery, the U.S. Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) decided it would be more
cost effective to create a data network linking the machines and their users. The research
and development that ensued lead directly to today's Internet (Salus 1995).
</P>

<P>At that time, there were fewer choices; it simply was not economically feasible to
provide dedicated computers to everyone who could use one.
</P>

<P>The model of a centralized processor and storage with remote users connected
via terminals is still common today. It has advantages&#151;having a single copy of
information held centrally avoids issues of inconsistency. The hardware and software
maintenance expertise can be centralized, and access to the information closely controlled.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-449"><P>Page 449</P></A>



<P>However, the approach has as many disadvantages. It doesn't scale well. As more
users require access, the central site has to become more and more powerful. A limit is
reached at some point, and the system cannot grow any further. Another major problem is that
of resilience; if the central node fails, the whole system is unable to function at all. If
the system happens to be central to a large corporation, the effect of such a failure could
be devastating.
</P>

<P>With the increasing availability of cheaper computing, first as minicomputers and
then microcomputers, the possibilities changed. It became feasible to connect a network
of machines together to spread the load, achieving higher levels of performance and
resilience than could be achieved with a single monolithic machine.
</P>

<P>First came the classic &quot;client/server&quot; pattern where data stored on a central server
is accessed and processed by remote client applications. This reduces the
processing bottleneck, but increases the demands on the network because all data has to be
transferred back and forth between client and server.
</P>

<P>Next came the &quot;peer&quot; pattern where, as far as possible, the data resides on the
machines where it is to be processed, and the distinction between clients and servers
diminishes. This brought new problems related to data consistency. Although some data is only relevant to
a single user or program, other data must be shared and appear consistent to all users
wherever it is stored. Changes made on one system must be reflected to other systems, and some
form of synchronization put in place to exclude the possibility of two or more systems
making incompatible changes to the same data. Having multiple copies of the data increases
its availability, but it also increases the complexity of ensuring its consistency.
</P>

<P>Although distributing computing resources decreases the impact of any system failing,
the additional links and machines actually increase the number of places where a system
can fail. Even if data is distributed, if the node fails where the data you want is located, then
it is just as inaccessible as if it had been on a single system.
</P>

<P>It would be reasonable at this point to give a couple of examples, which should be
familiar to most Internet users. Large repositories of files on the Internet are accessed using
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) (colloquially known as FTP sites). These take the
centralized approach and, despite having high bandwidth links (multiple 45 Mbps T3) and lots of
disk storage (about 100 GB) and memory (about 512 MB), they are still only able to serve
on the order of a few thousand users simultaneously. Many tackle this limit by setting
up mirror sites, but this still puts the onus on the user to select an appropriate site. By
contrast, the &quot;USEnet&quot; network news service is inherently distributed, with millions of
users accessing the feeds via their local servers. The data is not &quot;mission critical,&quot; so missed
and duplicated news items are not the problem they would be for a financial corporation.
