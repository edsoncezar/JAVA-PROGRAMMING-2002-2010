<P>The design and implementation of concurrent systems is a complex field in
computer science. This chapter attempts to cover the basics of multithreaded programming as
it's supported in Java. For further reading on these and related subjects refer to the
following texts:

Lea, Doug, Concurrent Programming in Java: Design Principles and
Patterns, Addison-Wesley, 1996 (ISBN 0-201-69581-2)

Programming, Prentice-Hall, 1990 (ISBN 0-13-701078-8)

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter introduced the idea of multithreading Java classes to produce objects that
can carry out work in parallel with the code that creates them. You should be familiar with
the Java Thread and ThreadGroup classes and understand how they are used.
</P>

<P>You should have learned some basic concepts of concurrent programming, including
the following:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>          The technique of mutual exclusion and how Java implements this using
synchronized methods and blocks.
<LI>          Communicating between threads using condition variables, wait() and notify().
</UL>

<P>Some of the common problems encountered with concurrently executing threads
were covered, with examples developed through several versions to demonstrate approaches
to coding that will help you to avoid or correct these problems. Working through the
various versions of the printer access classes pointed out common situations in which
race conditions occur and how the Semaphore class might be used to avoid them.
