Check Boxes and Radio Buttons
</A></H4>

<P>Two methods of prompting a user to choose between a series of options are by
using check boxes and radio buttons. Radio buttons allow a user to pick one option from a set <BR>
of mutually exclusive options, and check boxes allow a user to pick from a number
of options from a group. Although functionally different, the code used to implement them
is similar. Figure 5.1 shows a series of check boxes along the left side of the screen and
a pair of radio buttons on the right.

Figure 5.1 Two methods of obtaining input from a user: check
boxes and radio buttons.
</P>

<P>If you have a group of items from which the user must select only one, you would
choose to represent these items as a series of radio buttons. The radio buttons in figure 5.1,
for example, enable the user to choose his or her gender. Gender status is mutually
exclusive; you are either male or female (note that, like gender, it is possible to change the
selected radio button).
</P>

<P>Often the options presented to a user are from a group in which the user can select
more than one. With the check boxes in figure 5.1, the user is presented with a choice of
foods and asked to select those foods he likes. Note that the user is not asked for his
favorite food (that would involve radio buttons, as you can only have one favorite) but to
choose which foods he likes.
</P>

<P>Because they have totally different uses, you might conclude
that they are built using different code, but you would be wrong.
Check boxes are created by placing a series of Checkbox objects 
on-screen, and radio buttons are created by placing a series
of Checkbox objects on-screen, and then grouping them together
with the aid of a CheckboxGroup object.
</P>

<P>Having stated that the Checkbox and CheckboxGroup classes
are used to create check boxes and radio buttons on-screen, it is
obvious that a greater understanding of these classes will have to be
developed.

In noting the details of both radio buttons and check boxes, it
is important to realize that any one screen can have multiple groups
of radio buttons that are all mutually exclusive
at the group level.

<P>When simply passed a string, the Checkbox class creates a new check box with the
string as a label. This label can be altered later using the
setLabel() method. If you want to create a group of radio buttons, you first need to create an instance of the CheckboxGroup
class and then pass that class as a second parameter to
the Checkbox constructor. Note that this constructor also accepts a Boolean value
to indicate the initial state (checked or unchecked).
</P>

<P>Listing 5.3 shows the code behind the majesty of figure 5.1. Note the creative use of
blank Label objects that act as placeholders in the
GridLayout class. The blank Label objects are used to show one rapid way to work within the limitations of the AWT layout
managers. All layout manager classes in the AWT are discussed later in this chapter.

<P>The ability to place some radio buttons and check boxes on a screen is nice, but
besides impressing your friends, the code is pretty useless. Now you will take your new
knowledge of creating radio buttons and check boxes and add it to what has already
been covered in this chapter. You will create a simple frame that poses the question, &quot;What
is your favorite color?&quot; The user is presented with a series of choices, and after he makes
up his mind, the application uses the ModalOK class (from listing 5.4) to tell the user
the color that he chose. In the spirit of Monty
Python's The Holy Grail, you will allow the user to say &quot;I don't know.&quot; The code to create this Frame with radio buttons is presented
in listings 5.4a through 5.4c.
</P>

<P>The code in listing 5.4a builds the screen that is displayed when the application
loads. Note how the Checkbox objects are grouped with a CheckboxGroup object to form
radio buttons.

<P>Listing 5.4b contains the doResponse() method which our code will call when a
radio button is clicked. This method creates a new instance of the ModalOK class and
displays in that dialog box the label corresponding to radio button that was clicked.
