CardLayout
</A></H4>

<P>If you have ever flipped though a stack of
3&#165;5 index cards, you will have little trouble understanding the
CardLayout class. This class lets you specify a series of &quot;cards&quot;
where only one can be viewed at a time.
</P>

<P>You can add components to the class using the addLayoutComponent(String
name, Component target) method, where the name variable is a unique identifier, and the
target variable indicates where the &quot;card&quot; should be displayed.
</P>

<P>To flip through the cards sequentially, call next(Component target) and
previous (Component target); again, target indicates where the information should be
displayed.
</P>

<P>For nonsequential access to the cards the method
show(Container target, String name) is called, where the name variable matches the unique identifier applied when the
component was originally added.
</P>

<P>The class supports the following constructors:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     CardLayout(), which creates a default card layout.
<LI>     CardLayout(int hgap, int vgap), which creates a card layout with a &quot;hgap&quot;
horizontal gap and a &quot;vgap&quot; vertical gap.
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 19">
BorderLayout
</A></H4>

<P>BorderLayout enables you to lay out components in terms of five relative screen
positions: north, south, west, east, and center. Each component stretches to fill the screen;
those placed east and west stretch vertically; those placed north and south stretch
horizontally; the component placed in the center stretches in both directions. Components are added
by calling the add() method and passing it not only the component but also one of the
five screen positions. For example, add(&quot;North&quot;, new Label(&quot;North&quot;)) adds a label at the
top of the screen.
</P>

<P>Two constructors are supported, and are listed as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     BorderLayout(), which creates a default border layout.
<LI>     BorderLayout(int hgap, int vgap), which creates a border layout with a
&quot;hgap&quot; horizontal gap and a &quot;vgap&quot; vertical gap.
</UL>

GridLayout
</A></H4>

<P>Although the layout managers covered already do not have
much practical use, GridLayout will probably show its face from time
to time in your applications. GridLayout divides the screen into a
grid, and each component takes up one block on the grid. Every block
in the grid must contain a component, and no support is provided
either to skip over one block on the grid or to enable a component to
take up more than one block.
</P>

<P>The number of rows and columns in the &quot;grid&quot; is specified
as parameters to one of the constructors. The class supports a
default constructor (GridLayout(int rows, int cols)) that creates a grid of the specified size.
An additional constructor (GridLayout(int rows, int cols, int hgap, int vgap)) enables you
to specify not only a grid size, but also default spacing between each component.
</P>

<P>Components can be added to the screen by using the
add() method, where adding occurs in a left to right fashion. The block size of the grid defaults to the size of largest
component and remains constant for all blocks. In many cases, components are stretched
and look unappealing. For this reason, you should only stick with GridLayout when
all components are the same size.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although GridLayout does not enable you to skip over a block on
the grid, you can simulate a skip by adding some non-visible
component, such as a blank label (Label blankLabel =
new Label(&quot;&quot;)).

GridBagLayout
</A></H4>

<P>GridBagLayout is both the most flexible layout manager and the hardest to learn. It
works in conjunction with the GridBagConstraints class and gives you the freedom to
build screens that meet your specifications 100 percent of the time.
</P>

<P>In contrast to GridLayout, which creates a grid with a preset number of rows and
columns, GridBagLayout allocates space to the grid on the fly and is determined by
GridBag-     Constraints's variables.
</P>

<P>The following is the basic procedure required when building a screen using
the GridBagLayout manager:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>     Create a new instance of GridBagLayout.
<LI>     Call setLayout() with the GridBagLayout object.
<LI>     Create a new instance of GridBagConstraints.
<LI>     Configure GridBagConstraints's variables to properly deal with the component.
<LI>     Apply GridBagConstraints to the component.
</OL>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-160"><P>Page 160</P></A>


<OL START="6">
<LI>     Add the component to the screen.
</OL>

<P>The procedure seems relatively logical, but until you spend a lot of time working with
the class, you will have great trouble with the fourth item. Basically,
GridBagConstraints offers a series of variables that do things such as tell which grid block the
component should take up, the number of blocks that it can occupy, and also things such as how
the component is to be stretched when the screen is resized. The exact use of each variable
is detailed in the following sections.
</P>

<P><B>
gridx, gridy
</B></P>

<P>The gridx and gridy values specify the &quot;block&quot; on the grid that needs to be occupied
by the component; gridx indicates the row, and gridy indicates the column.
</P>

<P><B>
gridwidth, gridheight
</B></P>

<P>The gridwidth and gridheight values specify how many grid &quot;blocks&quot; should be taken
up by the component.
</P>

<P><B>
weightx, weighty
</B></P>

<P>The weightx and weighty values specify how a component is to be stretched when
the screen is resized. A value of 0 means that it never changes size. This value is rather
tricky to properly configure; set it around 100, and tweak it later.
</P>

<P><B>
fill and anchor
</B></P>

<P>The fill value is used when the component's display size is larger than its requested
size. The value determines whether (and how) to resize the component. The default value
is NONE, and other values are as follows:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>     HORIZONTAL.Does not change height, but stretches the component's width.
<LI>     VERTICAL.Does not change width, but stretches the component's height.
<LI>     BOTH.Stretches both the height and width of the component.
</UL>

<P>The anchor value is used when the component's display size is smaller than the grid
block and specifies where in the block to place the component. The default value
is CENTER, and additional valid values are NORTH, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST,
SOUTH, SOUTHWEST, WEST, and NORTHWEST.
</P>

Implementing the Layout
Managers
</A></H3>

<P>Now that you have a basic understanding of the potential each layout manger has,
this section takes five different buttons and shows what each layout manager can do with
them. You will create a small application that displays the five different buttons in one part of
the screen and displays a pop-up menu that enables you to change layouts in the other part
of the screen. All components are visible in the same Frame, and the only pull-down
menu option enables the user to quit the application.
</P>

<P>The Panel class, covered earlier, is a great tool for grouping together different sets
of components. The following example takes advantage of the fact that each panel can
have its own layout, enabling you to alter the layout of the five buttons in one Panel
without affecting the layout of the Panel that displays the pop-up menu. Both panels are added
to the main Frame, which has a consistent layout of GridBagLayout.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch05_ 23">
Switching Between Layout Managers
</A></H4>

<P>In the constructor for the panel that contains the different components, you place all
five buttons on the screen using the FlowLayout() layout manager. Switching between
different layout managers is easy except for GridBagLayout and BorderLayout.
</P>

<P>If you add a series of components to a screen using one layout manager, the call
set-     Layout() using a different layout manager, and then call
layout(), the screen is properly redrawn for you. This operation will cause problems with BorderLayout
and GridBagLayout because they add components in unique ways. Listing 5.17 shows
the code used to add the components using the BorderLayout layout manger.
</P>

<P>One final thing to note is that CardLayout is meant to display only one component at
a time. Therefore, when this option is selected you only see one component.
