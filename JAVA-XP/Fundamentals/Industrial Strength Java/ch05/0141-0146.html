<P>A button in Java is generated by creating a new instance of the Button class and adding
it to a screen. The Button class constructor accepts a String that is used as the text of
the button. If you take a look at listing 5.9, you will note the next class in this chapter's
ever-growing AWT demo application. The class uses the GridBagLayout class to place a
series of buttons on the screen. Again you ask the user the question, &quot;What is your
favorite color?&quot;

More Menuing
</A></H4>

<P>The AWT demo has progressed to support radio buttons,
check boxes, buttons, and pull-down menus. This section expands on
the menuing to include support for pop-up menus. A pop-up menu
is used on a frame to enable a user to make changes to some
setting. For example, most word processors employ this feature to
enable you to set fonts. In Java, you generate a pop-up menu by creating
an instance of the Choice class and calling its addItem() method
to sequentially add new options to the menu. At any time you can
call the getSelectedItem() method to get the label of the
currently selected option.
</P>

<P>Although in the radio button and check box demos you are able
to match the color of the option to the color of the components, it is
not really possible to do with a pop-up menu. Instead, you change
the color of the Frame to match the color selected by the user with
the setColor() method.

Human Computer Interface is a field of its own and is studied
in books larger than this one. You should note, however, that
the reason buttons are used when asking a user to answer a question is
to present him with all options up front so he can make a
fair decision.

running AWT application, simply compile it, and then uncomment the code in the
FileFrame method that creates a new instance of the ChoiceDemo class. Figure 5.6 shows
the ChoiceDemo class in action.

Scrolling Lists
</A></H4>

<P>If you take a pop-up menu and stretch out the number of choices visible at one time,
you end up with a scrolling list. A scrolling list serves two purposes:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>     It enables a user to view more than one option at a time.
<LI>     If warranted by the application, it enables the user to select more than one
item from the list.
</OL>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-146"><P>Page 146</P></A>



<P>You produce a new scrolling list by creating an instance of the
List class. The List class's constructor takes two parameters, an int indicating the number of rows visible at any <BR>
one time, and a Boolean indicating whether multiple selections are possible. Options
are added to the list by calling List's addItem() method. At any time you can query the
object for its currently selected options by calling either
getSelectedItem() if the list supports only one selection at a time, or
getSelectedItems() if the list supports selection <BR>
of multiple items.
</P>

<P>As with ChoiceDemo, the Frame's background color is set to match whatever the
user selects as his favorite color. The listing for the
ChoiceDemo class is contained in listing 5.11, and figure 5.7 shows the class in action.
