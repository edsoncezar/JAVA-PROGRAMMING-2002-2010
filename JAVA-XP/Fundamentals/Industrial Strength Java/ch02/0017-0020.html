<P>Now that the back end is shaping up, it is time to begin designing the front end. The
front end for this application comes in the form of the Display object, shown in figure
2.5. Display is in charge of displaying on screen a list of all available entries in the
contact book. Display is responsible for managing all user interaction, such as allowing the user
to create and delete entries, saving the contact file to disk, and retrieving full information
on a contact.
</P>

<P>The Display object functions by asking the Registry for a list of all registered
contacts. After this information has been obtained, the values of each Contact object's
firstName and lastName variables are displayed. The firstName and lastName fields are used
again later in the program's execution as search criteria when a user wants to view a
full information on a contact. The flowchart in figure 2.6 documents not only this process,
but the entire flow of execution that the program exhibits.

<P>The flowchart shows that the when the application begins, it streams in the contents of
a file that contains all contact information. Information on each contact is parsed out of
the file and used to create a series on Contact objects. As each Contact object is created,
it registers itself with the Registry object. After the file is fully processed, the Display
object is created and consequently creates an interface through which the user may interact
with the application. At this time, the application basically stops and waits for input from
the user. Figure 2.7 shows the application at this point.
</P>

<P>Now that display has been implemented, the only additional features that need
implementation are the saving of the entire data to a file and the deletion of contacts from
the contact book.
</P>

<P>As shown in figure 2.6, the contact book saves data via the following steps:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>     The Registry object is asked for a list of all Contact objects.
<LI>     The data from those Contact objects is written to a file.
</OL>

<P>When you look over the two steps for saving data and the steps taken when data needs
to be displayed, the process used to delete a contact becomes obvious. If the Registry
object does not have a contact object registered, then it cannot be accessed and, effectively,
does not exist. Therefore, the steps to delete a Contact object are as follows:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>     Tell the Registry object not to track the object that needs to be deleted.
</OL>

<P>For a final overview of the entire application, see figure 2.8,
which uses cloud-like shapes to indicate the existence of all objects in
the application. Objects that interact with each other have
interconnecting lines. Instead of detailing all methods, only those that are
of importance to the interaction between the objects are indicated.

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>You have stepped through your first object-oriented application. Was it as bad as
you thought it would be? As the book progresses, you will see how planning an
application aids in the development process.
</P>

<P>Code introduced throughout the book occurs in one of two formats. On one level,
code snippets serve as quick teaching tools and as references after you are finished with
the book. On a more advanced level, these examples help you to develop actual
applications. The applications developed throughout this book are designed with the same level
of detail provided for the contact book, except that in these cases you will actually code
the application.
