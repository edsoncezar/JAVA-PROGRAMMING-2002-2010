Object-Oriented <BR>
Programming

</H2>

<P>Programming in an object-oriented language can be a lot of fun. It can also be a huge 
headache. Headaches are obviously a result of not fully understanding the
environment, and having fun is a result of entirely grasping the environment. Most Java
books provide an overview of terms such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism,
but few really teach you how to visualize your application as a whole. Being able to
visualize your application is the most important step in the entire software development process. <BR>
By fully planning your application, the coding process becomes smoother, and
most importantly, your debug time decreases exponentially. As a reminder (and to serve as
a reference), this chapter briefly covers object-oriented programming terminology and
then jumps right into a discussion of the process used to design an application; in fact, you
will use this process to design a complete application.
</P>

<P>One of the most important points of this chapter is that object-oriented design mirrors 
human communication. As an example of this, parallel a human
dialogue to an object-based information transfer. The human
dialogue is constructed by stringing together a series
of phrases, which either tell the one individual about the other or ask questions of one 
individual.
</P>

<P>When two objects need to perform an exchange of information, one object either calls
an information-retrieval method in the other object or a set-information method in the
other. Learning to program with objects, therefore, does not require that you learn any
new concepts; it only means that you must approach application development in a
different manner.
</P>

Object-Oriented Programming Terminology
</A></H3>

<P>Every object contains a series of methods. Access to these methods is strictly
controlled, and without the proper permissions, one object cannot use another object's methods.
Most objects offer some methods that any other object can access and some methods that can 
be accessed only by certain objects.
</P>

<P>Allowing the outside world to access only a small part of your data is called
encapsulation. Because object interaction parallels human interaction, the discussion on
encapsulation is detailed with an object-to-human analogy. It could be stated safely that there
are two levels of human communication. We communicate with ourselves (thinking), and
we communicate with others (talking, typing, signing, and so on).
</P>

<P>When thinking, we access parts of our brain that are only &quot;viewable&quot; by ourselves. This
is very similar to an object, which limits certain data and methods to itself. To mark
such data and methods as such, the private keyword is used.
</P>

<P>Communicating with other objects is similar to the manner in which two humans
interact. When two humans talk, data is shared, and when two objects communicate, some data
is shared. Methods and data that can be shared between two objects are referred to as
public.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch02_ 3">
Inheritance
</A></H4>

<P>Although information transfer between two objects can be viewed as sharing data
that results from a computation, another form of object communication that passes along
the skills necessary to perform those computations is called
inheritance.
</P>

<P>As an example, if you needed to know the square root of 42, you could either ask me
for the answer or you could ask me how to compute the answer. If an object supports a
public method called getSquareRoot(int n), for example, any other object could call that
method and find out the square root of 42. However, an object could also inherit (or extend) off
the 
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-11"><P>Page 11</P></A>


<P>object that contains the getSquareRoot(int n) method, and then both objects would
know how to compute square roots.
</P>

<P>Objects that take on methods of other classes can accomplish this method gain by
inheriting from those classes. For example, whenever you develop an applet, that applet
is actually a subclass of the Applet class contained in the java.applet package, which is
why the init() method is automatically called when your applet loads.
</P>

<P>As humans, we inherit certain traits from our parents. These traits are so deeply
embedded in who we are that fighting them is pointless. For example, many people believe that
the ability to breathe is passed from the mother to child during pregnancy. Have you ever
tried to just stop breathing for a while? I doubt that you will be successful. Objects are the
same way. When one object extends another object, it carries along certain methods. The
child object can do nothing about the fact that it now has access to those methods; it
must simply accept them.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch02_ 4">
Polymorphism
</A></H4>

<P>If you are experienced with developing code in structured programming languages,
then you are accustomed to writing functions that accept one value and return another.
These functions are far from versatile and support input/output for a fixed data-set, which
is rather odd when you consider that there are few models in the universe that follow
the same pattern. Can you imagine what humans would be like if they could react to only
one type of input and then produce only one type of output based on it? Fortunately, this is
not the case with humans or in object-oriented programming.
</P>

<P>Imagine, for example, that humans were only programmed to answer one question:
Do you want pepperoni on that? And these same humans only knew one answer: Sure,
my cholesterol is rather low today! This situation could get pretty sticky when dealing
with people who have high cholesterol or are vegetarians. In structured programming,
a function is a lone block of code that serves a totally unique data-set.
</P>

<P>Polymorphism (&quot;many forms&quot;) is the process by which objects are able to respond
to different environments. As humans, polymorphism enables us to inform the bearer of
the pepperoni that we are vegetarians. An object-based example is an object that can
evaluate a mathematical expression stored on a stack or on a parse tree and produce a correct
result 
</P>

<P>in each situation.

Applying Object-Oriented Theory <BR>to Application Design
</A></H3>

<P>Most explanations of object-oriented programming (OOP) are incomplete because
they often do not show how OOP concepts are put to use. Many books on Java simply
introduce the concepts early and then teach you Java syntax without much regard for
how theory applies to application development.
</P>

<P>To properly develop industrial-strength applications, you should have a full grasp on
OO theory. To reinforce this fact, most examples in this book are complete applications,
and before their code is revealed, you are given a detailed understanding of how and why
the code was developed.
</P>

<P>Remember that by designing your application before you begin coding, you can
reduce errors and ensure the success of your application. The end of this chapter discusses
the design of a working application. In the discussion of the design, the full outline of
a project is developed. By the end of this chapter, you will have little trouble
understanding how to take the outline and make it a full-fledged application.
</P>

<P>The application outlined in this chapter is a simple contact book (addresses,
phones numbers, and so forth). Due to space constraints, the application is not developed to
a point where it could compete with a product such as Now Software's Now Contact, 
but you will see how the application's potential for expansion includes a
comparable feature set.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch02_ 6">
Contact-By-Contact: Allowing for the <BR>Existence of Each Contact
</A></H4>

<P>On the most basic level, the contact book needs to hold data about all of your
contacts. The information about each contact is contained in a separate instance of the
Contact object. Figure 2.1 shows a representation of the Contact object made while developing
this application.
</P>

<P>The notation for the Contact object is quite easy to understand. It has public methods
for getting and setting quantities, such as first name, phone, fax, and e-mail. Another
method,
