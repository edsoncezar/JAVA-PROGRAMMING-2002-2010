Introducing Networking

</H2>

<P>One of the most exciting aspects of Java is programming for a network. Experienced <BR>
network programmers are familiar with the headaches caused by trying to
convince different hardware and operating systems to communicate in anything but the
most primitive ways. The java.net package includes classes that enable the programmer
to easily pass data across networks. When this factor is combined with Java's
platform independence, network programming becomes as simple as coding for the
stand-alone computer.
</P>

<P>In this chapter and the next, you will learn how to use Java to pass information
between programs running on separate machines. Java will do much of the work for you;
however, you first must become familiar with several concepts. Because many programmers
with years of experience are just now becoming familiar with the technical details of
the Internet, the first section of this chapter introduces the necessary concepts to learn
network programming. The topics covered in this chapter follow:

Programming for Networks
</A></H3>

<P>The java.net package was designed to transfer data across TCP/IP networks.
Although there is no reason the classes cannot be extended to deal with other protocols, the
examples provided throughout this chapter deal with TCP/IP.
</P>

<P>When your computer sends data to another machine, it must deal with a handful
of variables. What type of machine will receive the data? What types of wires will
actually carry the data? With the immense size and complexity of the Internet, rarely does
one know the answer. Even if one did, it would be poor style for the programmer to assume
a certain set of conditions would always hold true. However, one is not expected to
write programs that detect different types of networks and behave differently. Instead,
the network is divided into layers. Each layer handles a piece of the task. The result is that
the big picture can easily be divided into distinct tasks and jobs.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch10_ 3">
Layers
</A></H4>

<P>When you execute a simple network program, such as a telnet session, the data
you transfer passes through seven distinct network layers. The uppermost layer is
represented by the application you are running, and the lowermost layer is represented by the
actual network connection (wire) plugged into your machine. When you send
information, another header is appended to the data each time the data is passed to a lower level.
When the information is returned, each layer strips off one header. The seven layers, in
descending order, are shown and described in table 10.1:

<P>Of these seven layers, application, transport, network, and physical can be considered
the &quot;primary&quot; layers, while you are learning networking. To make things even simpler,
the code

you will write deals with either the application or the transport layer. The
following mini-table associates these layers with concrete examples:
</P>

<P>HTTP, TCP, IP (Application, Transport, and Network) can all be referred to as
protocols. The physical layer refers to topologies. It would not be too &quot;wrong&quot; to simplify this
and refer to all examples as protocols.

<P>The classes of java.net deal with either the application layer or the transport layer.
An example of the application layer is an URL; an example of the transport layer is a
socket. If you feel competent with the information presented so far, great. If not, you will
understand it better as you see how java.net implements the concepts.

URLs
</A></H4>

<P>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the fully qualified address of an object on
the Internet. It specifies the protocol, host, port, and file to be accessed. A generic URL
format follows:
</P>

<PRE>
[protocol]://[full.host.address]:{Port}/[file/path]
</PRE>

<P>The port is optional and does not need to be specified if you are accessing the default
port for the protocol. Here are two examples:
</P>

<PRE>
<a href="http://www.xyz.org:8080/letters/g.html">
http://www.xyz.org:8080/letters/g.html</A>

Ports, Protocols, and Connections
</A></H4>

<P>A port is not a physical opening in your computer or some network control box. Rather, <BR>
it is a number that allows a system to maintain multiple network connections
simultaneously. A protocol is another way of saying a rule.
Protocols are the standards that govern the Internet. Finally, a
connection is just what you would imagine it to be. You
will see how it applies to network programming.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-326"><P>Page 326</P></A>



<P>A single machine accepts data from a variety of network connections
simultaneously through the use of ports. Many common services have a dedicated port. Because
some ports are reserved for common services (&quot;common&quot; is a misnomer&#151;many
common services are rare proprietary standards that are seldom used these days), the
programmer cannot use any port (see table 10.2). Ports numbered under 1024 are often referred to
as reserved ports, many of which are reserved for a specific program. None of these ports
are available to standard users on Unix computer systems. If your program is designed for
all types of users, not just administrators, it is important that you only attempt to use
ports over number 1024.

<P>The Internet and all networks are governed by a series of
protocols. Each protocol is a group of rules that specify how applications
that conform to the protocol behave. TCP, IP, UDP, HTTP, SMTP,
and most of the acronyms that are associated for the Internet are
protocols. Protocols define every detail of how a message is sent from
the header format to the &quot;end&quot; command. Luckily, with Java, the
devel-     oper does not need to understand all the intimate details of
each protocol, only their general properties and behavior.
</P>

<P>Network programming has two general types: connection
and connectionless. Connection-oriented
programming is exactly what the term implies&#151;the client and server have a communication
link that is open and active from the time the application is executed
until it is closed. Using Internet jargon, the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol. It is a reliable
connection&#151;packets are guaranteed to arrive in the order they are sent.
A familiar example of a connection-oriented network is the
phone system.
</P>

<P>In connectionless programming, each instance that packets are sent, they are
transmitted individually. No link to the receiver is maintained after the packets arrive. The
Internet equivalent is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP ). Connectionless communication is
not

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although you will find the services mentioned in the
table running on their default port on most machines, the
ser-     vices may also be running on a second port. A simple way
to have two web servers on one machine is for the second to run on <BR>
a non-standard port. The URL <a href="http://my-/">
http://my-</A>
.machine.name:8080 specifies that a web server is running
on port 8080.
