Summary
</A></H3>

<P>By now you should be comfortable sitting down and writing network code at the
same speed as you write Java code in general. In fact, you should experiment with the
examples provided in this chapter and write some of your own code before continuing. The
next chapter deals with advanced networking techniques and presents implementations
of several common servers, including SMTP and HTTP.
</P>

<P>Most readers probably fall into one of two categories: programmers with a
network background or programmers unfamiliar with the network. If you are in the first group,
you understand by now how much the java.net package provides that has not previously
been integrated into a popular language. Also, you realize that programming with the classes
in java.net.* is much simpler than using TLI or other network extensions. If you are in
the second group and thought to yourself, &quot;What was all the fuss about network
programming being so tricky,&quot; be glad that you have Java as a tool so that programming for the
network is more accessible than ever.
</P>

<P>The java.net package contains all the classes that are necessary in order to program for
the Internet. From the simple downloading of data via a URLConnection to writing
complex client-server applets using multiple threads and sockets, it is all built into the Java
Development Kit. Java is network-aware. For the programmer, this means guaranteed
compatibility across platforms and versions. As more and more users demand applications
that are &quot;network-ready,&quot; Java and the java.net package promise to be at the forefront
of development technologies.
