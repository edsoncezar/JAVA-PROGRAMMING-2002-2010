JDBC

</H2>

<P>This chapter is intended to facilitate the development of database access applications 
using Java. The focus of this chapter is the Java Database Connectivity
Application Programming Interface, or JDBC, as it is known. The features of this API are
explored with relevant code examples. Alternative technologies for database access from
Java applications are evaluated. In addition, the compelling reasons for the widespread
acceptance of JDBC are presented.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch17_ 2">
What is JDBC?
</A></H3>

<P>With the widespread development and deployment of Java-based applications,
developers and users require database connectivity that is easy and flexible. Powerful, yet
simple, application code that is independent of any particular DBMS or database
connectivity mechanism is often sought by developers. In March 1996, JavaSoft announced their
step in this direction. The first specification for the JDBC API was made available as a draft
for open analysis. Within months, leading commercial database vendors and
third-party developers introduced JDBC-compliant drivers and products using JDBC.
</P>

<P>JDBC is intended as a call-level SQL interface that provides Java programmers with
a uniform interface to a wide range of relational databases. It is similar in concept
to Microsoft's Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API, which has become the standard
for personal computers and LANs. JDBC provides a common base on which
higher-level APIs and tools can be built. Using proprietary interfaces for Java applications is no
longer
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-758"><P>Page 758</P></A>


<P>necessary because the JDBC provides a standard DBMS-independent database
access mechanism. This operates via a Driver Manager that can support multiple drivers
connecting to different DBMSs.
</P>


<H3><A NAME="ch17_ 3">
What Does JDBC Do?
</A></H3>

<P>The primary function of JDBC is the execution of
SQL statements and the retrieval of results. It defines Java classes to
represent database connections, SQL statements, result sets, metadata, and
so on. These classes, written completely in Java, enable a much
closer interaction than what would normally be possible by embedding
C language function calls in Java programs.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch17_ 4">
JDBC Release Information
</A></H3>

<P>Today, JDBC 1.1 is available. This version will be included in
JDK 1.1 (Java Development Kit) and can be downloaded as a
compressed .tar or .zip file from the following:

<P>This includes the .java and the .html files for the API; however,
this does not include any database drivers. The JDBC 1.1 specification
is available from the JavaSoft site as a postscript or acrobat file.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="ch17_ 5">
The Application Programming <BR>
Interface of JDBC
</A></H3>

<P>The Java core classes have been designed to use different methods to perform
different tasks, instead of using methods that take many parameters to control a wide range
of behavior. This pattern has been maintained in the JDBC API.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The JDBC API allows a Java program to pass a query to
an underlying DBMS driver. This means that the application
can exploit the capabilities of the underlying DBMS; however,
this leads to the risk of receiving an error on other DBMSs
that might only have some (if any) of the specific functionality that
is required.

<P>The key components of the API are shown in figure 17.1.

<P>The components are discussed in the following sections.

Driver Manager
</B></P>

<P>The Driver Manager controls the interaction between the application and the driver
being used. It can support multiple drivers connecting to different DBMSs. It loads the
requested driver and provides support for the managing database connections.
</P>

<P><B>
Drivers
</B></P>

<P>Drivers provide the interface between the application and the vendor-specific
DBMS. JDBC drivers are currently available from a number of vendors. A list is
available at the following site:
</P>

<PRE>
<a href="http://splash.javasoft.com/jdbc/jdbc.drivers.html">
http://splash.javasoft.com/jdbc/jdbc.drivers.html</A>
</PRE>

<P>Drivers can be written in Java so that they can be downloaded along with an applet.
They can also be implemented using native methods to connect to database access
libraries. JavaSoft requires that a driver support at least ANSI SQL-92 Entry Level functionality
to pass the JDBC compliance tests.
</P>

<A NAME="PAGENUM-760"><P>Page 760</P></A>


<P>In general, the drivers should provide implementations of the abstract classes that
are specified in the JDBC API. Each database driver should provide a class that
implements the java.sql.Driver interface. This interface is used by the java.sql.DriverManager class
to locate a driver for a particular database URL. In
addition, each driver must provide implementations of the following interfaces:
</P>


<UL>
<LI>          java.sql.Connection
<LI>          java.sql.Statement
<LI>          java.sql.PreparedStatement
<LI>          java.sql.CallableStatement
<LI>          java.sql.ResultSet
</UL>

<P>Drivers can be classified as indicated in the following sections.
</P>

<P><B>
A Native-API Partly Java Driver
</B></P>


<P>This type of driver maps JDBC calls to calls on the client API for Oracle,
Sybase, Informix, DB2, or some other DBMS. It also requires some binary code to be loaded
on each client machine. This driver is useful when corporations want to develop Java
applications, and at the same time leverage their existing investment in DBMSs that do not
have ODBC drivers. Because the driver maps the JDBC calls to client API calls, the
Java application does not need to embed native DBMS access API in it.
</P>

<P><B>
A Net-Protocol All-Java Driver
</B></P>


<P>This driver is considered to be the most flexible type. It translates JDBC calls to a
DBMS-independent net protocol, which can then be translated to a vendor-specific
DBMS protocol by a server. The net server middleware is capable of connecting its Java clients
to a variety of different databases. Vendors that provide this type of driver probably
provide products that are suitable for use in intranets. To support Internet access, these
drivers must satisfy web-imposed security requirements. For example, they limit access
across firewalls, among other things.
</P>

<P><B>
A Native-Protocol All-Java Driver
</B></P>


<P>This driver translates JDBC calls to the network protocol used by the
vendor-specific DBMSs. DBMS vendors are the source for these drivers because many of the
protocols used in this scenario are proprietary. Using these drivers is a feasible solution for
intranet access because they enable a direct call from the client machine to the DBMS server.
