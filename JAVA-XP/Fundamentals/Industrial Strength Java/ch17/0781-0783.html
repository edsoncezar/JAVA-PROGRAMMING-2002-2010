<LI>     DECIMAL&#180;java.lang.Bignum. DECIMAL also
represents fixed point numbers when absolute precision is
required. This type is often used for currency values.
<LI>     BIT&#180;Boolean. BIT is mapped directly to the Boolean
type in Java. It can be used to indicate a 0 or 1 value.
<LI>     BINARY&#180;byte[]. BINARY can be expressed as a byte
array in Java. Java programmers do not need to
distinguish between the three SQL byte arrays: BINARY,
VARBINARY, and LONGVARBINARY.
<LI>     VARBINARY&#180;byte[]. VARBINARY can be expressed as
a byte array in Java.
<LI>     LONGVARBINARY&#180;byte[]: LONGVARBINARY can be expressed as a byte array in Java. The
LONGVARBINARY SQL type can be used to return multi-megabyte data
values. So, it can be retrieved as a Java input stream.
Programmers can then read data from the stream, in the chunk size
that they prefer.
<LI>     CHAR&#180;String. CHAR is expressed as a String type in Java. Java programmers
do not need to distinguish between the CHAR, VARCHAR, and
LONGVARCHAR SQL data types because they can be expressed identically in Java.
<LI>     VARCHAR&#180;String. VARCHAR is expressed as a String type in Java.
<LI>     LONGVARCHAR&#180;String. LONGVARCHAR is expressed as a String type
in Java. The LONGVARCHAR SQL type can be used to store
multi-megabyte strings. By retrieving a LONGVARCHAR value as a Java input stream,
programmers can retrieve the value in chunks. Java streams can be used for Unicode,
as well as ASCII data.
<LI>     DATE&#180;java.sql.Date. Consists of a day, month, and year. For SQL DATE
infor-     mation, java.sql.Date can be used. The hour, minute, second, and
millisecond fields of the base class java.util.Date are set to zero.
<LI>     TIME&#180;java.sql.Time. Consists of hours, minutes,
and seconds. For SQL TIME information, java.sql.Time can
be used. The year, month, and day fields of the base
class java.util.Date are set to 1970, January, and 1,
respectively. This signifies the &quot;zero&quot; date in

Both the NUMERIC and DECIMAL SQL data types are mapped to
java.-     lang.Bignum extended precision number type, which
is provided in JDK 1.1. Moreover, simple Strings and arrays
of chars can be used to access DECIMAL and NUMERIC values.
In this way, Java pro-     grammers can use getString to receive
a NUMERIC or DECIMAL result.

the Java epoch.
<LI>     TIMESTAMP&#180;java.sql.Timestamp. Comprises of
both DATE and TIME, and also a nanosecond field. For
SQL TIMESTAMP information, you can use
java.sql.Timestamp. This class has a nanosecond field, too.

<P>This section discusses the mapping of results and parameters
whose types are known at compile time. Some applications may not
have knowledge of the database schema that they access, at the time
they are compiled. So, JDBC provides support for complete
dynamically typed data access.

JDBC Metadata Capabilities
</A></H3>

<P>Metadata is information about the data in the database and the database itself.
This information is invaluable when determining the nature of the data in the database, and
the capabilities of the database. The initial design of JDBC used complex methods in
core JDBC classes to implement metadata features. This approach was, however, discarded 
and replaced by two additional interfaces in JDBC release 1.10. JDBC provides
database application programmers with two interfaces that provide a wide range of
metadata functions. These interfaces are java.sql.DatabaseMetaData and
java.sql.ResultSet-MetaData.
</P>

<P><B>
The DatabaseMetaData Interface
</B></P>

<P>DatabaseMetaData provides metadata about the database itself. The methods of
this interface generally return their results in java.sql.ResultSet objects. Only a few of the
most commonly used features of DatabaseMetaData are discussed here. For a
complete reference document, refer to the JavaSoft web site at the following:

The standard Java class java.util.Date does not match any
of the preceding three SQL data types exactly, although
it provides date and time information. It lacks the nanosecond
value needed for TIMESTAMP. Consequently, three subclasses
of java.util.Date are defined.

URL is returned as a Java String object, if it can be determined.
An SQLException is thrown if the URL cannot be determined.
<LI>          String
getUserName(). Returns the user name that is known to the database as
a Java String object. It throws an SQLException if the user name cannot be
determined.
<LI>          int
getMaxConnections(). Provides the maximum number of active
connections that the database can support. An integer representing the maximum number
of connections is returned.
<LI>          ResultSet getTables(String CatalogName,
String SchemaNamePattern, String TableNamePattern, String
TableTypes). Searches for tables matching the TableNamePattern and the specified TableTypes (for example, Table,
System Table, View, and so on) in the catalog (specified by CatalogName). It also
searches for all the schema matching SchemaNamePattern. It returns a ResultSet
containing the descriptions of all the tables matching the above mentioned criteria. Each
row in the ResultSet describes a single table. The user can iterate through the
ResultSet to obtain table descriptions.
</UL>

<P>If you are wondering how to specify the catalog names and
schema names, methods to obtain the catalog names and schema
names from a database exist. Similarly, there are methods that
determine the available table types and general database information
(this includes the product name, product version, and information
about the provided driver).
</P>

<P><B>
The ResultSetMetaData Interface
</B></P>

<P>This metadata interface is probably more commonly used than
the DatabaseMetaData interface. The ResultSetMetaData interface
gives an application programmer information about the ResultSet
obtained from a query. The programmer can use this interface to
determine properties of the columns in a ResultSet.
</P>

<P>The important methods of this interface are mentioned in
the following list, along with a brief description:

Not all the methods of this interface may be completely implemented by
all database drivers. Database vendors or third-party
driver providers may implement only the most commonly
used methods. Any method that is not implemented throws
an SQLException, if the method is invoked.
