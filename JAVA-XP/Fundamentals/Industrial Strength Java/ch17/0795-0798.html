Java API for Databases
</A></H4>

<P>An increasing number of database vendors might provide a Java API for database
access. An example is MsqlJava (refer to
<a href="http://www.minmet.uq.oz.au/msqljava/).">
http://www.minmet.uq.oz.au/msqljava/).</A> MsqlJava is a Java API for mSQL databases.
</P>

<P>Using a Java database API would produce a seamless integration of database access
code within the application. Therefore, this is certainly a more desirable approach compared
to CGI scripts.
</P>

<P>However, using a Java database API restricts the application to the particular DBMS
for which the Java API is provided. Therefore, JDBC is certainly a better option.
Furthermore, not many DBMSs come with a Java API. (To this author's knowledge, mSQL is the
only DBMS that provides a Java API.)

Vendor Tools for Database Access from <BR>
the Web
</A></H4>

<P>Some DBMS vendors provide tools for web access; for example, Microsoft's SQL
Server Web Assistant (refer to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platforms/doc/backoff/sqldrop/hydra/admin/src/adminwn_4.htm)">
http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk/platforms/doc/backoff/sqldrop/hydra/admin/src/adminwn_4.htm)</A>
. This is a non-CGI solution for database access from the web. The Web Assistant is mainly used to create HTML pages
on a pre-scheduled basis, triggered basis, and so on. For more information on how
Microsoft SQL Server can be used in the Internet environment, refer to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/sqlinet1.htm.">
http://www.microsoft.com/sql/sqlinet1.htm.</A>
</P>

<P>However, using these kinds of tools limits the web application to a particular DBMS and
a particular vendor. This is not a desirable characteristic of any application.

JDBC's Future Direction
</A></H3>

<P>JavaSoft intends to provide a higher level API over JDBC that will target
transparent objects and relational mapping. This will enable the mapping of Java objects to one
or more relational database tables. JavaSoft also plans to enhance the capabilities of
the JDBC API to include increased cursor support and other useful features. Currently,
there are plans for a Java Transaction Service API that will be designed to enable Java
programs to complete transactions across multiple databases (refer to
<a href="http://splash.javasoft./">

com/jdbc/jdbc.databases.html).

Other Database Access <BR>
Technologies for Java
</A></H3>

<P>There may be other non-relational DBMS-based options available to Java
application programmers who want to introduce persistence in their applications. The options
presented in the following sections are Persistence through Object Serialization and
ODMG Java Object Database Standard.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch17_ 37">
Object Persistence Using Object Serialization
</A></H4>

<P>For small applications, it is possible that the amount of data
involved may not be sufficient to warrant the use of a DBMS. In
such situations, it may be optimal to use Object Serialization to
emulate database functions (such as persistence).
</P>

<P>Object Serialization involves the mapping of objects into an
object output stream and the subsequent reconstruction of objects from
an object input stream.
</P>

<P>Most common Java objects can be serialized by using the
Object Serialization system
(http://chatsubo.javasoft.com/current/serial/index.html
). Serialization of user-defined classes requires the implementation of either the Serializable or
Externizable interface. The difference between the two interfaces is that the
object stream for Serializable objects contains sufficient information
for reconstructing an object from the stream, whereas
Externizable objects are solely responsible for their external formats and
reconstruction.
</P>

<P>Serialization can be used for persistence by creating files of
objects. These files can be used instead of databases; however, it
becomes the responsibility of the programmer to save all the objects in
files (using serialization) before quitting the program and to read
these objects from files before starting execution again. The
overheads involved are quite considerable and increase rapidly with
increasing numbers of application objects. An example of providing persistence for Java objects
is Persistent Java (http://copeland.smartchoice.com/~laforge/index.html#
Introduction), created by Bill la Forge. Serialization has been used for persistence
in other languages such as C++ using products such as the Tools h++ Class Library
from

ODMG Java Object Database Standard
</A></H4>

<P>Object Database Management Group (ODMG) and JavaSoft created a new working
group in February 1996. The goal of this working group is to define an object database
standard for Java. Object databases are ideally suitable to represent Java objects in a
transparent and seamless manner. Key concepts of the standard include
transparent persistence, persistence by reachability, multiple implementations of Java binding, and addition
of classes to Java in order to implement the complete ODMG object model.
Transparent persistence involves making active instances of Java objects persistent without
any modifications to existing code. The requirement that all objects that can be reached
from any root object be made persistent at commit-time is defined by
&quot;persistence by reachability.&quot; The Java environment must be enhanced to fully comply with the
ODMG object model. This requires that classes and constructs such as collections,
relationships, transactions and databases be added to Java.
</P>

<P>Currently, there are some products designed for
object database support for Java. They include ObjectStore PSE (persistent storage engine) from ObjectStore and
POET for Java from POET. However, these products do not claim to be compliant with the new
ODMG Java standard for object databases.

<P>This chapter provided you with an overview of the aims and functions of JDBC.
The documentation of the JDBC API should prove to be a valuable guide. The
real-world implementation scenario shows how JDBC is used to achieve better integration
and flexibility for a corporate enterprise. The insight provided can be extended to
other environments. A comparison of JDBC with competing technologies showed a
perspective that may be used when making you make decisions. As it evolves to provide
wider functionality, JDBC certainly is a technology worth watching and following.
