Looking Inside RandomAccessFile
</A></H4>

<P>The sheer number of methods supported by this class can make it rather intimidating.
On the other hand, having so many methods at your disposal can be exciting. Most of
the methods contained in RandomAccessFile should be familiar to you from the
DataOutput-     Stream and DataInputStream classes. What does need to be studied is the manner in
which one stream can provide read and write access, and the manner in which you can
change your position in a string.
</P>

<P>When you create a new RandomAccessFile object you pass it
to either a File object or a String object representing a system-
dependent file path, and a String object representing the mode
with which the file is to be opened. If this mode String object has a
value of &quot;r,&quot; the stream will have read only permission to the file.
However, if the mode String object has a value of &quot;rw,&quot; the stream
will have read/write access to the stream.
</P>

<P>The name RandomAccessFile stems from the fact that you
can randomly jump around the file when reading or writing.
The getFilePointer() method returns the current position in bytes of the file pointer from
the beginning of the file. This position can be altered using the seek() method; seek() is
passed a long integer that represents the position at which the next read should start. This
position begins at the start, where the first byte is zero indexed.<BR>

Those of you who are familiar with C will probably
relate RandomAccessFile to the manner in which C deals with I/O.

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter covered a lot of ground. It is not assumed that you know all the methods
in the java.io class, but you should leave this chapter with an understanding of all classes
in this package. If you are a little shaky, reread specific parts of the chapter to better
understand the information provided. After you feel that you understand all the methods,
take some time to experiment with the different stream classes. Any large application that
you may develop will rely heavily on I/O, and you will benefit greatly from an
understanding of the classes covered in this chapter.
