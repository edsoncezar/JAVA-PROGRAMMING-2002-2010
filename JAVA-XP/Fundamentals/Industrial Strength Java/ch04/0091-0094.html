Applets

</H2>

<P>Because this book is geared toward application development, you might be surprised
that it contains a chapter about applets. Indeed, other chapters focus more heavily on
application code than applet code, but although application development numbers among
the more powerful uses for Java, certain projects require the implementation of
applets. Applets employ a distribution medium that most people recognize, eliminate the
headache associated with distributing software upgrades, and enable users to interact in an area
of familiarity.
</P>

<P>This chapter serves primarily as an applet development reference. The following
sections discuss an applet's required characteristics, as well as how to properly implement
these requirements. In addition, the chapter concludes with a detailed discussion on how
to decide whether to develop your project as an applet or as an application. If you plan
to undertake any applet development in the future, keep this chapter on hand as a reference.

Applets versus Applications
</A></H3>

<P>When developing an applet, you must work within the
&quot;Java applet security sandbox.&quot; This sandbox is the result of the high-level security restrictions the browser places on the
applet. These restrictions exist for good reason&#151;without them, malicious applets could damage
a host machine. Developing within the sandbox can be very annoying, however, and
sometimes you might feel as though you are jumping through hoops to produce a
working solution. With all the headache involved, the big question remains: Why develop an 
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-92"><P>Page 92</P></A>


<P>applet?
</P>

<P>Applets offer many advantages over an application, which you can exploit to produce
a successful business solution. These advantages prove useful in two distinct
categories: distribution and administration.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 3">
The Applet Distribution Model
</A></H4>

<P>In the past year, the World Wide Web has become a household name for many
reasons. The Internet has moved from something that &quot;geeks&quot; kept as a little secret to
something that even their moms turn to for entertainment or information. This means that
although many people are not familiar with the steps involved in the local installation of a
remote application, virtually everyone understands the steps involved in downloading a web
page. Now that Java applets can be distributed through web pages, users of your software
can click on one link and begin using your software within a short time frame.
</P>

<P>Because of Javasoft's intense marketing during the past year,
you probably already recognize this concept. This topic, however,
should not be taken lightly. If you distribute your software to thousands
of people, you should consider developing it as an applet.
Installing software on thousands of machines costs money, and allowing
your users to install the software themselves saves both time and money.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 4">
Administration of Applets
</A></H4>

<P>Depending on your occupation, you might find administration to
be one of your biggest headaches. If you oversee hundreds of
computers, you would need to work day and night to even hope to keep
all software fully updated. With business applications, however, it
is usually necessary to keep up with the most recent versions. If
your staff uses a custom-developed application to access the
company Oracle database, for example, your staff most likely will need
the updated software before it is available. With applets, the most
recent versions are downloaded every time a client uses them.
Therefore, distributing a new version is as simple as placing that new
version on the company intranet web server.

Currently, the major browsers download new copies of
an applet's class files every time they are needed. In the
future, however, browsers might download applets once and
then access them from a local file. When this happens,
applet authors most likely will stamp each applet with a
version signature, in which case the applet will
be downloaded only if the server has a version with a more
recent version number.

Inside Applets
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter covers virtually every aspect of applet development. As with any new topic,
it is important to build a stable foundation before diving too deep into the topic. The
next few sections teach you about embedding an applet in HTML, some methods specific
to applet development, and also the form that an applet takes.

Developing Applets
</A></H4>

<P>This book does not intend to provide a detailed analysis of the applet development
cycle; its focus remains the development of large projects. However, you can use the text as
a reference and model for applet implementation.
</P>

<P>Although applets do suffer greater restrictions than applications, the two are not
radically different. In fact, most of the topics covered in this book apply to applets as well
as applications.
</P>

<P>The development of a complete applet reference involves the following steps:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>     Coverage of the appropriate HTML used to call an applet from a web page
<LI>     Coverage of certain methods to which only applets have access to
<LI>     The building of two applet frameworks
</OL>

Calling an Applet via HTML
</A></H4>

<P>You don't need magic to place an applet on a web page. In fact, the process
appears similar to the process of inserting an image. At the most basic level, an applet joins a
web page with the &lt;APPLET CODE=&quot;xxx.class&quot;&gt;&lt;/APPLET&gt; container tag, where
xxx.class is the name of the class file that extends java.applet.Applet. However, as with images,
the tag can accept additional attributes. Table 4.1 describes these attributes in detail. If
you plan to develop applets, mark this page for future reference.

Any additional information passed into the

The name attribute of an applet, used mainly
for inter-applet communication.

ARCHIVE
</TD><TD>
Enables you to specify a .zip file to be
downloaded instead of a series of .class files. New
to Netscape Navigator 3.0, this attribute proves useful when many .class files exist and can
be downloaded faster all at once.
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Listing 4.1 illustrates an example of a web page that uses many of these attributes.
Note that a browser that contains the capability to display applets displays an applet
named &quot;MyApplet.class,&quot; located in the Applets directory, in a
300&#165;300 square to the right of the web page. This applet includes a 10-pixel margin on all sides. If a browser that does
not support Java (such as Lynx) loads the page, the screen displays the words, &quot;Either
your browser does not support applets, or display has been disabled.&quot;
