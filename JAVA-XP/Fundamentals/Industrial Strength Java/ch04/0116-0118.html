Differentiating Applets from <BR>
Applications
</A></H3>

<P>Applets can basically accomplish the same procedures as applications, and you can
apply the techniques for working with applications to applet development. However,
certain differences do exist between applets and applications.
</P>

<P>If you prefer tiny details, you probably could write an entire book about the
differences between applets and applications. The primary differences, however, have one
distinct theme&#151;security.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="ch04_ 13">
Security Issues
</A></H4>

<P>An applet's functionality is limited by one major factor;
the security manager. The security manager basically gets to play God over your applets by instituting a set of
pre-defined rules to which your applets must conform. The security manager stops an applet's <BR>
attempts to violate any rule.
</P>

<P>Although security often ranks as the chief source of headaches for programmers, it
does keep users safe. Remember that an applet is an independent program that you allow to
run on your system. Without restrictions on applets, they could cause huge security
holes. Imagine, for example, loading what you thought to be a simple animation applet
and instead finding that the applet scans your hard drive for credit card numbers and
uploads that data somewhere else!
</P>

<P>Obviously, the need exists for some level of applet security, but the level to which
this security is implemented remains an item of debate. Currently, the restrictions are
very strict, but this might change at some point in the future.
</P>

<P><B>
Restricting Access to a File System
</B></P>

<P>As one of the more obvious restrictions, applets cannot access the local file system.
This means that not only can an applet not scan your hard drive for financial data, but it
also cannot create directories, write files, or even check the attributes of a known file.
This creates problems when you attempt to write applets that retain information about its
user in a preferences file. Incidentally, a preferences file allows your favorite word processor
to remember your favorite font every time you load the application. To avoid this
problem, you usually must store all user information server-side and then force the user to
&quot;log-in&quot; every time he uses the applet.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-117"><P>Page 117</P></A>


<P><B>
Restricting Access to Outside Servers
</B></P>

<P>Moving beyond the local file system, the applet's potential external connections are
also limited. Although Java contains rich networking features, applets can load data only
from the server that hosts the pages. Many developers are confused by this restriction. After
all, if a web browser can access a web site anywhere in the world, why does an applet not
gain this freedom? Simply, a standard web page consists of text that does not contain the
ability to actually take any action, such as reading files from your hard drive. Careful readers
now point out, however, that web pages used to be text, but now they can contain Java
applets. Users of a web browser have the freedom to load any web page they desire, and those
web pages can contain any number of Java applets.
</P>

<P>To cut to the chase, the issue involves trust. When you load a web page that contains a
Java applet, you load that web page from a known host. You can decide whether you trust
that host and either download the web page or cancel the download. If you load a Java
applet from a known (trusted) web site, and if that Java applet extends to a different
(untrusted) source for data input, the applet could load a new class from a host that you do not trust.
</P>

<P>Granted, &quot;trust&quot; is a term that is not too technical and deserves further explanation. It
is not always a safe practice to randomly download files to your hard drive (or RAM
cache). It is a rare occurance that an HTML page or Java applet contained on an HTML
page could cause problems, but the chance is there.
</P>

<P>This trust in Java applets is currently being examined as a source for a more
flexible security manager. This proposed security manager is based on code-signing, in
which developers finish an applet and then &quot;sign&quot; it. This digital signature would not
guarantee that an applet is not malicious, but it would guarantee the source of the applet. Thus,
if you download an applet from java.sun.com, you can be confident that both the true
source of the applet is java.sun.com and that no one has modified the applet since the
Sun engineers finished with it.
</P>

<P>As a user, you could set up rules based on digital signatures. For example, you could
allow all applets developed as part of your corporate intranet total unabridged access to
your machine and all external machines. However, you also could institute a rule that
treats applets from servers different from those maintained internally. This system
currently exists for Microsoft's ActiveX.
</P>

<P>In the ShakerNET applet developed earlier in the chapter, the new window bore the
stamp &quot;Unsigned Java Applet Window.&quot; This stamp acts as part of the security manager
and prohibits a developer from tricking a user into thinking that an applet is actually
their standard web browser.
</P>


<A NAME="PAGENUM-118"><P>Page 118</P></A>


<P>As the last restriction that could affect you as a developer, your applets do not
contain access to any threads outside their own group. This is actually very logical as if an
applet were able to toy with Threads belonging to another applet or to another application, a
very dangerous situation might develop.
</P>

Summary
</A></H3>

<P>This chapter provides an excellent resource on applets, and the rest of the book
details developing powerful Java code. Some of this code violates the applet security
manager and thus cannot be used in applet development. However, you can use most of the code
in any applet. Remember that applets are not limited to silly animations or scrolling
texts: You can develop a very powerful applet that can solve many business issues. In
fact&#151;supported by the points at the beginning of this chapter&#151;applet development
often emerges as a more logical choice than application development.
