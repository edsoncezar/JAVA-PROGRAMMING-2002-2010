The First Java Day, 1995</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
It was a sweltering Indian summer day in New York City in October,
1995. EarthWeb's team of crack Internet programmers had managed
to get tickets to the very first Java Day. We had heard of Java
before, and a few of us had kept up with the white papers and
Usenet groups. We knew something was afoot, but to that day all
that we had heard could be classified as hype without substance.
This would be Sun's chance to prove that Java would live up to
its reputation.
<P>
Everybody who was anybody in the East Coast cyberworld sat crammed
together in the standing-room only auditorium. The conference
began with a highly-polished sound and light extravaganza, featuring
a giant fake coffee percolator (no joke!). We witnessed some of
the most famous programmers in the world dancing on the stage
to loud rock music as if it were Letterman. We sat through elaborate
introductory remarks peppered with terms like &quot;object oriented,&quot;
&quot;robust,&quot; &quot;platform independent,&quot; and &quot;network
aware.&quot; We were amused but not convinced: These terms were
so overused already that on their own they didn't mean much. 
<P>
There was a tangible feeling of electric excitement throughout
the room. Everyone could tell something really new was beginning
and we all were a part of it. Things began to heat up during a
tongue-in-cheek dialogue between Eric Schmidt and Arthur Van Hoff,
where they demoed Java running inside of Netscape for the first
time. Poor Arthur had been up debugging this demo for at least
84 hours and was a bit punchy. We still hadn't seen any code yet,
but we had to admit, this was cool.
<P>
Bill Joy stood up and told us about the history of the Java language.
Java began as a small entrepreneurial experiment by a group of
Sun engineers. They had begun with a radical, if somewhat misguided,
project: to design a new operating system for set-top boxes and
consumer electronics devices. The team examined existing languages
to see if they were up to the task and found that none of them
had both the power and simplicity that this goal required. Their
solution: Write a new language. Their approach promised to result
in a language that was as powerful as C++, as object-oriented
as Smalltalk, as easy to learn as Perl, but that avoided the particular
headaches of each, and that worked seamlessly over the Internet.
<P>
But what did this language look like? For the developers in the
audience, the crucial turning point was Frank Greco's tutorial,
&quot;Your First Jolt.&quot; Finally, we all got to sink our teeth
into the code itself. This was the moment we had been waiting
for. And oddly enough ... it looked like C! We had been expecting
some esoteric new hybrid syntax from another planet. This was
a bit of a letdown for about a second and half, and then we realized
that the very familiarity of Java code would enable it to catch
on like wildfire.
<P>
As the day progressed we were shown a number of early demos of
what Java could do on the Web. Miko Matsumura, from <I>HotWired</I>,
showed some of the first animated media applets and blew us all
away. Dimension X showed their cool Vectorman demo and a prototype
of their VR rendering engine-it looked like a gray Pop Tart floating
in space, but it showed promise (later this evolved into Liquid
Reality). We also sat through a very boring talk about connecting
content feeds to some weird server hardware that had essentially
nothing to do with Java but that everyone thought was cool anyway
because we were all so excited. Finally, Danny Hillis delivered
a fascinating speech on the grand scheme of human evolution and
the future of information technology, in which he masterfully
unified it all with Java in the final sentence (what a genius!).
<P>
We realized that a new stage of the Internet revolution was about
to start. Dozens of fledgling Java companies were already forming
in the audience as developers began to brainstorm. The Java community
was forming before our eyes. We realized that this new community
would need a central meeting place-a Web site where Java developers
could share information, learn, and keep abreast of the state
of the art. 
<P>
But we knew, with all due respect, that Sun's Java site just wouldn't
cut it. The Java Team engineers at Sun were busy enough working
on the language itself and would not have time to maintain this
central community site. We also knew that for our own purposes,
we needed access to this kind of information if we were going
to be leaders in developing Java software for the Internet. Like
the original Java Team itself, we saw a need, assessed existing
resources, and chose to create our own solution.
<P>
During the lunch break between free Danish, we cornered Kim Polese
and Lew Tucker of Sun and convinced them to endorse the project.
They agreed that a site of this nature would be an invaluable
catalyst for the growth and adoption of the Java paradigm. By
the end of the day we had a mission-now all we needed was a name.
<H2><A NAME="GammaWhat"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Gamma-What?</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
On the island of Java there is a traditional form of performance
art in which a troupe of musicians, dancers, and puppeteers enact
famous tales from the <I>Mahabarata</I>, one of the Hindu classics.
The leader of the puppeteers is known as the Dalang. The performance
sometimes lasts all day or even for many days. Delicately carved
leather puppets dance behind backlit curtains, projecting phantom
shadows before the audience. Dancers wearing brightly painted
masks depicting gods, goddesses, and demons cavort to the rhythms
of a large orchestral ensemble. Unlike a western orchestra, the
music is composed in an exotic tuning and the instruments are
mostly percussive-including gongs, metallophones, drums, and zithers.
<P>
This orchestra is called a Gamelan.
<P>
Why did we use this weird name? Well, first of all, we liked it
because it sounds cool. Secondly, the Java Revolution had barely
begun and all the good coffee names were already taken (we discovered
this after fruitless hours searching the Internet for every coffee-related
domain name imaginable. Sun had taken many of them in a vast defensive
maneuver. By the way, java.com was already owned by Mr. Coffee,
Inc.!). We also liked the name because it related to the island
of Java and a few of us had actually played in real Gamelan orchestras
in college. Like a Gamelan orchestra, our Gamelan site would bring
together both creators and audience for an entertaining and educational
community experience. The only downside of the name has been the
large number of people who come up to us at trade shows and compliment
us on our cool &quot;Game-Land&quot; site. Gamelan is actually
pronounced as &quot;gamma-lawn,&quot; and is actually not about
computer games-it's about gardening.

The Beginning</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Once we had a name, we really got to hacking-well, actually it
was Alex Chaffee who did all the work. The rest of us just breathed
down his neck and made comments that he mostly ignored. We started
with a simple text-based database backend populated with the few
existing applets and other resources that we found on Sun's &quot;Applets
at Other Sites&quot; page and on a few other sites on the Net.
Two weeks after we started writing code, the site went live and
we commenced our marketing strategy: Build it and they will come.
After only a few postings to the new Java mailing list (there
wasn't yet a Usenet group), Gamelan began to receive hits.
<P>
Among the first of them were a number of visits by students from
universities in Indonesia wondering what this new Gamelan site
was about. Soon after that we were paid very cordial visits by
various Javanese dignitaries: the cultural ambassador for Indonesia,
and the head of the largest Gamelan orchestra in the USA. The
ambassador was very interested in our project and thought it was
wonderful that a New York Internet company would create a major
Web site to promote Gamelan music and Javanese culture. We tried
to explain that we were promoting Java software, and he seemed
to understand. However, as he left our office, he happily suggested
that we collaborate on future Gamelan performances in the USA.
<P>
Within a few weeks, Gamelan became the central site for Java on
the Internet. Java developers and programmers from around the
world flocked to the site to find out what was going on. We were
pleased to see domains from the best labs and companies in the
world in our log files, coming back every day, and sometimes every
few hours. Soon our applet listing was larger than Sun's. Not
long after that, Sun's Java Team abdicated to us, stopped listing
new applets on their Java site, and simply linked users to Gamelan
instead. Within a few weeks of launch, Gamelan was the most successful
site EarthWeb had ever built. And it didn't stop there-Gamelan
kept growing and growing.
<P>
We received our one millionth hit on the thirtieth day after launch.
Soon we were receiving up to 200,000 hits a day and we moved the
site from its training wheels (a shared Sparc 10) to a dedicated
Sparc 20. We started running ads for Symantec. Within two months
hit levels had grown beyond 500,000 hits per day and even the
new server was groaning. We appealed to Sun for help and Alex
Davidson and Kate Christopherson, of Sun's Netra Internet Server
division, came through by providing us with sponsorship in the
form of a custom built, prototype Ultra Sparc server. On the basis
of this new, much faster machine, we launched the second version
of Gamelan, which was more graphically intensive and incorporated
a number of our own Java applets into the interface. A few months
later, we moved the site and the Ultra to a dedicated 10MB port
on a T3 Internet hub point. Now we were really wired!
<H2><A NAME="GamelanToday"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Gamelan Today</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Gamelan's primary mission is to serve as a central registry and
directory of Java resources. Much like Yahoo! (<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com</A>),
Gamelan collects links to resources stored on other sites across
the Web. However, unlike Yahoo!, which attempts to index all the
possible categories of information on the Internet, Gamelan's
mission is much more specific. Gamelan collects and classifies
pointers to resources related to Java and JavaScript. This specificity
allows us to go into more depth than Yahoo!; we collect a wealth
of information on each entry, including its URL and a brief description,
and also information about its author, links to related resources,
documentation, and so forth.
<P>
All of this information is searchable in Gamelan, so in addition
to finding a resource by way of its category, you can find it
by entering arbitrary keywords or specific search criteria. The
resources we accept range from applets-Java programs you can add
to Web pages-to articles about Java, announcements and press releases,
Web sites and developers' groups devoted to Java, people and companies,
and even source code and programming examples. We constantly update
and expand the directory, classifying new submissions, reorganizing
categories, and adding fields. It's a lot of work, but we love
it.
<P>
Gamelan also serves as a showcase for the latest and greatest
in Java technology. We also have separate sections on the site
listing &quot;What's Cool&quot; and &quot;What's New.&quot; Plus,
every week or two, we select a new submission as the &quot;Featured
Applet.&quot; This applet is meant to illustrate an aspect of
Java or an implementation of a technique that we find especially
instructive, well-executed, or just plain cool. The Featured Applet
has become so popular that we have actually crashed someone's
Internet service provider by featuring their applet-they got so
much traffic that their host couldn't sustain the load. We now
ask for permission before designating Featured Applets.
<P>
Our own applets are often released on the Gamelan, and have frequently
served to illustrate new applications of Java to solve real problems
faced by Webmasters that had previously been unsolvable. For example,
our Gamelan Navigator applet provides a &quot;bird's-eye&quot;
view of the Gamelan hierarchy, allowing visitors to our site to
step back and get a broader sense of the information space. Our
Site Monitor applet provides a real-time view of the accesses
to the site, and demonstrates the use of Java to communicate between
client and server. And Java allowed us to create EarthWeb Chat,
the first online chat room that is truly seamlessly integrated
with the Web, which is also featured within Gamelan.
<P>
In addition to being a directory and a showcase, Gamelan is the
de facto center of the Java community. Most serious Java developers
visit our site every day to keep up with breaking developments
and new techniques (not to mention their competitors!). Using
EarthWeb Chat, they can communicate immediately with each other
to exchange observations and techniques. They can also visit our
Who's Who section to discover the interests, activities, and e-mail
addresses of hundreds of other Java developers and users. Plus,
our Announcements section allows them to unveil their latest projects
and to keep abreast of current events. Gamelan is really much
more than a directory-it's an online community.
<H2><A NAME="GamelansAudienceandIndustryPosition"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Gamelan's Audience and Industry Position</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Gamelan focuses on Java, a somewhat technical subject. However,
our audience comprises a broad spectrum of the Internet population.
Our users come from all around the world, and are primarily early
adopters. In particular, significant portions of our audience
come from high-tech companies. However, increasing numbers of
casual Internet surfers are visiting Gamelan to play with the
latest Java applets. As of this writing (May, 1996), Gamelan averages
between 500,000 and 1,000,000 hits a day, for an average of approximately
two to four million pages (as opposed to raw hits) a month. Our
audience constitutes one of the most prized market segments for
Internet advertisers, and we now run advertising for technology
leaders such as Symantec, Borland, Sun, and others.
<P>
Gamelan has achieved an industry position as the central site
for Java developers and users on the Internet. As well as winning
numerous industry awards, Gamelan has been ranked among the top
25 most popular Internet sites by <I>PC Magazine</I>, based on
an analysis of Internet traffic. Gamelan has been featured in
the press countless times, including such well-known publications
as <I>WIRED</I> magazine, the <I>Washington Post</I>, <I>PC Magazine</I>,
<I>Communications Week</I>, <I>Interactive Age</I>, <I>Inter@ctive
Week</I>, and on c|net television, among many others. We have
even heard reports of Java focus group studies which indicated
that Gamelan is used by nearly 80 percent of Java developers as
their primary source of information on Java. Gamelan is endorsed
by Sun, and specifically by JavaSoft, SunSoft, and SMCC, and is
linked off of Netscape's &quot;Directory&quot; and &quot;Search&quot;
pages as a primary Internet resource. Gamelan is linked to by
numerous other major Web sites and by most, if not all, Java related
sites. As a testament to Gamelan's growing brand-name status it
is now the subject of books and CD-ROMs (for instance this!).
We couldn't be more pleased by the popularity of Gamelan; it proves
that hard work and community service on the Internet can be highly
successful and even rewarding.
<H2><A NAME="WhereGamelanisHeaded"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Where Gamelan is Headed</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Gamelan has certainly come a long way since it started-is there
anything left to be done? Oh, yes! Behind the scenes, our procedures
for classifying entries and maintaining the database are continually
being improved. We recently changed the database backend to a
more modular and powerful setup, which will allow us to make changes
more easily and robustly. We are also adding more information
to the database-including ratings and comments-and establishing
a new database in which to store event and announcement information.
We are also considering establishing a searchable source code
library (though that might take a little work). Finally, we are
expanding and unifying the search capabilities of the site, allowing
more sophisticated field-based searching as well as the existing
keyword search.
<P>
The user interface of Gamelan is also becoming more and more refined.
We were one of the first sites to use HTML 3.0 frames to provide
a unified navigational view. We were also the first to use a Java
applet to give an alternative to the maze of twisty little links
that most of us call Web surfing. Look for future enhancements
along those lines, including a graphical site navigation aid.
Moreover, we are working on applets that will allow you to both
view and edit the database itself, again fulfilling Java's promise
to allow Internet computing to match and surpass current GUI operating
system functionality. We are also developing Web sites related
to Gamelan. Our new site, Toko: The Java Shop, builds on the success
of Gamelan to provide an online venue for buying and selling Java
software (&quot;Toko&quot; means &quot;shop&quot; in Indonesian).
Toko is positioned to catalyze the growth of a commercial Java
industry, just as Gamelan catalyzed the growth of a Java development
community.
<P>
Gamelan started from a flash of inspiration during a conference.
That's the way a number of Internet innovations were actually
invented and we're proud to uphold this tradition. Today, Gamelan
is an important feature of the next-generation Internet that is
evolving before our eyes. It seems like Java is being licensed
into just about everything these days-we would not be surprised
to find Java actually licensed into consumer devices such as handheld
computers, fax machines, cellular phones, game machines, and perhaps
(in an interesting recursive twist of fate) even coffee machines.
In any event, we are glad to be situated comfortably in the eye
of this technology hurricane and we hope you enjoy our site.
