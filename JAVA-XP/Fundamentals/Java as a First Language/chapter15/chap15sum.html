<h2>Summary of Chapter 15<br>
</h2>

<h2>
<ul>


<li>Dynamic data structures can be much more efficient in their
use of resources than static data structures.
<p>

<li>A dynamic data structure consists of a number of nodes and
links which connect them together. 
<p>

<li>A class declaration file can encapsulate private class declarations
within itself. 
<p>

<li>The <i>LinkedList</i> and
<i>BinaryTree</i> as presented
in this chapter both implement the <i>OrderedStructure</i>
interface, allowing either of them to be used wherever an <i>OrderedList</i>
can be used.
<p>

<li>Recursive data structures contain instances of themselves,
within themselves.
<p>

<li>Recursive actions call themselves as part of their implementation.
<p>

<li>Recursion is more cognitively complex than iteration but for
many requirements is provides a much simpler design.
<p>

<li>A binary tree is more appropriate than a linked list when
there is a large number of additions and searches, but a smaller
number of removals and traversals.
