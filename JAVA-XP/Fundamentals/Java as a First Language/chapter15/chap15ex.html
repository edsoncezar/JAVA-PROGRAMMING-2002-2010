<h2>Exercises for Chapter 15<br>
</h2>

<h2>
<ul>
<p>
15.1 Revisit the <i>OrderedList</i>
demonstration harness from Exercise 14.1 and re-implement it to
demonstrate the equivalence of the <i>LinkedList</i>
and <i>BinaryTree</i> classes
as presented in this chapter.<br>

<p>
15.2 Revisit the <i>ContactList</i>
application from Exercise 14.3 and re-implement it to demonstrate
the equivalence of the <i>LinkedList</i>
and <i>BinaryTree</i> classes
as presented in this chapter.<br>

<p>
15.3 Trace the construction of a binary tree when the data to
be stored in it is supplied in an alphabetical sequence. What
does this tell you about the advantages of a <i>BinaryTree</i>
over a <i>LinkedList</i>?<br>

<p>
15.4 Revisit the black box test plans from exercise 14.5 and consider
their relevance to the <i>LinkedList</i>
and <i>BinaryTree</i> structures.
Produce glass box test plans for all three structures and compare
the tests now required for all of them. What does this tell you
about the importance of glass box considerations?<br>

<p>
15.5 It was not possible to use a <i><b>binary chop</b></i> search
to locate the position to insert a new element into a <i>LinkedList</i>,
as it was not possible to determine the preceding node in the
list. A <i>DoubleLinkedList</i>
is made up from nodes which contain two links, one for the next
node in the list and one for the previous node in the list. Implement
a <i>DoubleLinkedList</i> class
using a binary chop search in the <i>add()</i>
action.<br>

<p>
15.6 Adapt the demonstration harness from Exercise 15.1 to store
all the integers from 1 to 1000 in a random sequence and to subsequently
output them, in an <i>OrderedList</i>,
a <i>LinkedList</i>, a <i>DoubleLinked</i>
list and a <i>BinaryTree</i>.
Execute each harness several times and calculate the average execution
time in an attempt to determine which structure is the most efficient.
