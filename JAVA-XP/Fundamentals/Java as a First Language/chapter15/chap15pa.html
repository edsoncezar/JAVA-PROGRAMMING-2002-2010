<h2>15.10 <i>LinkedList</i>s, and <i>BinaryTree</i>s compared
</h2>

<p>
The major advantage of <i>BinaryTrees</i>
over <i>LinkedLists</i> are that
it can be much faster to search for elements, which includes adding
elements, as this is essentially a search for the appropriate
location followed by the insertion. With a <i>LinkedList</i>,
or indeed with a Vector, a search
of the structure might have to traverse the entire list if the
element being sought is not present or is the last element in
the list. With a <i>BinaryTree</i>
the range of the search is restricted by up to half on each iteration
and this can dramatically improve the performance for large structures.
However this is not always the case as will be demonstrated in
an end of chapter exercise. <br>

<p>
<i>BinaryTrees</i> are not as
suitable when it is expected that an Enumeration
traversal of the structure would be frequently required and, for
this implementation, if a significant number of removals of elements
from the structure was envisaged. <br>

<p>
However the major reasons for introducing dynamic structures before
the end of this introductory book is because they are representative
of a much larger number of structures which might be suitable
for particular requirements. By becoming familiar with the design
and implementation of these structures at this stage it will be
possible to approach these more advanced structures when required.
<br>

<p>
The <i>BinaryTree</i> also allows
the concept, and implementation, of recursion to be introduced.
Although, when it is first encountered, recursion is very difficult
to comprehend, once assimilated it can be very powerful. There
is always an iterative alternative to a recursive design, but
in many cases the recursive design is simple and elegant whereas
the iterative design is inelegant and complex. Again an initial
familiarity with recursion at this stage is essential.<br>
