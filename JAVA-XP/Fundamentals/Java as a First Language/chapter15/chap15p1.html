<h2>15.1 Linked Lists<br>
</h2>

<p>
A linked list is a data structure which, assuming it is not empty,
contains an <i><b>element</b></i> which holds the <i><b>data</b></i>
being stored and a <i><b>link</b></i> which connects it to the
rest of the list. The rest of the list, assuming it too is not
empty, contains an element which holds the second data item being
stored and a link which points to the rest of the list. This third
element in the link is identical to the first two elements, and
so can contain links to further elements, which themselves contain
links to further elements, etc. Eventually the list will come
to an end where the link in an element does not contain a reference
to a further element. A linked list, containing three e-mail addresses,
is illustrated in Figure 15.1.<br>

<p>
Each element in the list, which contains the data being stored
and a link which can connect it with the next, is known as a <i><b>node</b></i>.
In Figure 15.1 the first node in the list contains the details
of <i>anorak@boring.com</i> and a link which connects it to the
second node containing <i>geek@nowhere.edu</i>. This node contains
a link to the third node containing <i>sad@lost.org</i> and, as
this is the last node in the list its link is shown as a , connecting
it to nothing. As suggested in the diagram the nodes are maintained
in the list in an alphabetic sequence, so if the details of <i>dull@hopeless.com</i>
were added the structure of the list would have to change to that
shown in Figure 15.2.<br>

with another node added.<br>
</font></center>
<p>
Likewise if <i>abbot@monastery.org</i> were added it would have
to be inserted into the list before <i>anorak@boring.com</i> and
the link of the <i>abbot</i> node would have to connect to the
<i>anorak</i> node, whose onward links would have to be undisturbed.
Or if <i>zzz@snooze.gov</i> were added it would have to be linked
to the <i>sad</i> node, with its link not connecting to a further
node.<br>

<p>
When an element is removed from the list then the node containing
the element will have to be removed, reconnecting the links as
appropriate. For example, if <i>geek@nowhere.edu</i> were removed
from the list in Figure 15.2, then the node containing <i>dull@hopeless.com</i>
would have to be linked to <i>sad@lost.org</i>.<br>
