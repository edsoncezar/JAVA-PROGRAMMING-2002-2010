<h1>Chapter 15. Dynamic and recursive data structures<br>
</h1>

<p>
In this chapter the consideration of data structures will be concluded
with an introduction to a group of data structures known as <i><b>dynamic
data structures</b></i>. These structures can grow, and shrink,
as they are used, under the developer's control. This is something
like the Vector and Hashtable
classes introduced in Chapter 13. Those structures will reallocate
space for themselves as more elements are added, but will not
automatically release the space once it is no longer required.
The two structures which will be developed in this chapter will
dynamically obtain, and subsequently release when no longer required,
the resources used to store them.<br>

<p>
For small structures, containing perhaps a few hundred elements,
this is an insignificant consideration. But as the structures
get larger, containing perhaps thousands of elements, this can
become a significant consideration. The first structure which
will be introduced, known as a <i><b>linked&nbsp;list</b></i>,
is not suitable for use with large structures, but introduces
the concepts and techniques which are required for the second
structure, known as a <i><b>binary&nbsp;tree</b></i>, which is
suitable. Many other dynamic data structures can be developed
and used, in addition to the two which will be presented, and
a knowledge of the nature, construction and characteristics of
this family of structures is an essential part of learning to
become a software developer. <br>

<p>
The implementation of the binary&nbsp;tree structure will also
introduce another technique for controlling the execution of software.
In addition to sequence, selection and iteration it is also possible
to use <i><b>recursive</b></i> control structures. Recursion is
more cognitively complex than the three techniques used so far
but for some situations it is an extremely elegant technique.
