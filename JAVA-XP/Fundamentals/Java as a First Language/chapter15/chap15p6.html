<h2>15.6 Binary Trees<br>
</h2>

<p>
This part of the chapter will introduce the final data structure,
binary trees. The easiest way to describe the nature of a binary
tree is to show a tree being constructed from a sequence of data.
Figure 15.12 illustrates the construction of a binary tree from
the names <i>geek</i>, <i>sad</i>, <i>boring</i>, <i>zzz, anorak</i>
and<i> dull</i>.<br>

<p>
A node in a binary tree contains the data which is being stored
and two links to other nodes, known as the left and the right
links, either or both of which may, or may not, link the node
to a further node. The first diagram in Figure 15.12 shows a tree
consisting of a single node, known as the <i><b>root node</b></i>,
storing the name <i>geek</i>. When the next name, <i>sad</i>,
is added to the tree it is stored in a new node which, as <i>sad</i>
is alphabetically greater than <i>geek</i>, is linked into the
tree as the right hand node of the <i>geek</i> node. Likewise
the third name, <i>boring</i>, is linked as the left node of the
<i>geek</i> node as it is alphabetically lower than <i>geek.<br>
</i>
<p>
The forth name, <i>zzz</i>, needs to be added to the right of
the <i>geek</i> node but the <i>sad</i> node is already in this
position. So the rule is applied again, <i><b>recursively</b></i>,
to the <i>sad</i> node and a new node containing the name <i>zzz</i>
is linked to the right of the <i>sad</i> node. Likewise the fifth
name, <i>anorak</i>, needs to be added to the left of the <i>geek</i>
node, but as this is already occupied it is added to the left
of the <i>boring</i> node. The final name, <i>dull</i>, needs
to be added to the left of the <i>geek</i> node already occupied
by <i>boring</i>. When the rule is applied to the <i>boring</i>
node it is added as a new node to the right of the <i>boring</i>
node, producing the final diagram in Figure 15.12.<br>

<p>
This process could continue with the addition of more names, using
the rules as described above, to produce an increasingly complex
binary tree. One characteristic of the tree is that for any node,
all the names which are alphabetically greater than the name at
that node will be found to the right of it and all the alphabetically
lower names to the left.<br>

<p>
One other way of thinking about a binary tree is that it contains
the data stored at the <i><b>root node</b></i> location and two
binary trees. Each of these binary trees can be an empty tree,
containing no data, or a non-empty binary tree and two further
binary trees. Each of these trees can be empty or non-empty and
if non-empty contain two further binary trees. This definition
of a binary tree contains within itself more binary trees, an
example of a recursive definition. As the data structure can be
described recursively it can also be constructed recursively as
suggested above and implemented below.<br>
