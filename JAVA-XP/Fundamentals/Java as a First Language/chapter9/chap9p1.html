<h2>9.1 The <i>SimpleInput</i> and <i>ValidatedInput</i> class hierarchy
</h2>

<p>
Input from the user was first obtained in Chapter 6 when the <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">BasicMenu</font></i>
class was developed but this input was limited to a single character.
In order to accomplish the input an instance of the <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">java.io.DataInputStream</font>
class was constructed from the pre-supplied <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">System.in</font>
class. The reason for this was that the <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">System.in</font>
class is a raw input stream which regards its input as a sequence
of byte values and has no knowledge of its division into lines,
each terminated by an <font SIZE="2">&lt;ENTER&gt;</font> key press.
The <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">DataInputStream</font> class is
able to recognise the division of the user's input into lines
and it will be instantiated again in this chapter to provide the
basic input facility. <br>

<p>
The abstract <i>BasicInput</i> class will encapsulate the instantiation
of the <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">DataInputStream</font> class
within itself and supply two semi-public actions, <i>readLong</i>
and <i>readDouble</i>, both of which may throw an exception when
they are called. These actions are provided to support the <i>ValidatedInput</i>
class which supplies two corresponding actions, <i>readLong</i>
and <i>readDouble</i>. These actions implement an iterative dialogue
with the user and do not return until the user has provided an
appropriately formatted numeric value within limits supplied as
arguments. The class hierarchy diagram for these two classes is
given in Figure 9.1.<br>
