<h1>Chapter 9 Keyboard input and formatted output<br>
</h1>

<p>
One of the most fundamental operations required by interactive
programs is to obtain input from the user via the keyboard. This
sounds a very simple operation, but in practice can be fraught
with problems. For example whilst the program may be expecting
the user to input a floating point value it must be prepared to
accept and respond to anything which the user may type in. Java's
standard classes, strangely, do not supply any keyboard input
routines for numeric values and the first part of this chapter
will introduce a class hierarchy which implements this facility.
<br>

<p>
In order for this to happen the techniques by which exceptions
can be thrown and caught will have to be introduced in greater
detail than previously. Considering the example above; whilst
the program is anticipating a number to be input the user may
type in the word 'help'. This will cause an exception to be thrown
and unless it is caught and handled will cause the program to
terminate prematurely. This is an unacceptable occurrence for
production quality programs and can only be avoided by catching
and handling the exception.<br>

<p>
The <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">System.out.println</font>() action
has been used since the earliest chapters for the output of numeric
values. However, the output produced by this action is determined
entirely by Java and is consequently not always appropriate for
the application's requirements. The latter part of this chapter
will introduce a class which allows for numeric output to be precisely
formatted. <br>
