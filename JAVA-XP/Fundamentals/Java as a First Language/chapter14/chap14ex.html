<h2>Exercises for Chapter 14<br>
</h2>
<h2>
<ul>

<p>
14.1 Complete the demonstration harness clients for the <i>Queue</i>,
<i>Stack</i> and <i>OrderedList</i>
classes and use them to increase your confidence that the classes
are implemented correctly.<br>

<p>
14.2 Produce a black box test plan for either the <i>Queue</i>
or <i>Stack</i> classes and compare
it with the actions you have included in demonstration harnesses
from Exercise 14.1. By how much has this increased your confidence
in the implementation of the class?<br>

<p>
14.3 Revisit the <i>ContactList</i>
application from Chapter 13 and re-implement it making use of
an <i>OrderedList</i>. From the
user's point of view are there any differences?<br>

<p>
14.4 Using the <i>LibraryBook</i>
hierarchy from Exercise 13.6 re-implement the <i>LibraryList</i>
application making use of an <i>OrderedList</i>.
<br>

<p>
14.5 Produce a black box test plan for the applications from 14.3
and 14.4. Compare the two test plans and decide which aspects
of the tests are testing the <i>OrderedList</i>
functionality. What would this imply for the test plan of a third
application which also makes use of an <i>OrderedList</i>?
