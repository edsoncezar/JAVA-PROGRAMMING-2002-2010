<h1>Chapter 13 Standard Iterative Data Structures<br>
</h1>

<p>
The previous chapter introduced a class which contains an homogenous
iterative data structure. Prior to this the examples had, largely,
concentrated upon the representation and manipulation of a single
data item. Although single data items are fundamental to the production
of software artefacts, most applications require that an iteration
of data items are processed. The topic of iterative data structures
is commonly known simply as <i><b>data&nbsp;structures</b></i>
and is a large and complex part of software development. This
book can only provide an initial introduction to this important
topic.<br>

<p>
The internal implementation of the iterative data structure in
the previous chapter was by means of an <i><b>array</b></i>. This
chapter will continue the introduction to arrays and will also
introduce some other standard iterative data structures which
are supplied by the Java environment. The two following chapters
will continue with a consideration of some developer supplied
iterative data structures.<br>
