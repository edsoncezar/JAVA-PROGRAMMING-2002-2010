<h2>Summary of Chapter 12<br>
</h2>

<h3>
<ul>
<li>Streams are places where information can flow between a program
and various devices. 
<p>
<li>Text streams store information in a human readable format
which can also be used to transfer information between different
computer systems. However a text stream is larger than its equivalent
binary stream.
<p>
<li>The <i><font FACE="Arial">args[]</font></i> argument
to the <i><font FACE="Arial">main()</font></i> action can
be used to obtain the command line arguments, as <font FACE="Arial">String</font>s.
<p>
<li>Streams, and data structures, which contain items of exactly
the same class are known as homogeneous. Those which contain items
of different classes are known as heterogeneous.
<p>
<li>Data in text format is written to a stream with <font FACE="Arial">println()</font>
and read from the stream with <font FACE="Arial">readLine().</font>
<p>
<li>Data in binary format is written to a stream with <font FACE="Arial">writeInt()</font>
(or <font FACE="Arial">writeDouble()</font> etc.) and read
with <font FACE="Arial">readInt()</font> (or <font FACE="Arial">readDouble()</font>
etc).
<p>
<li>Strings can be written to a binary stream with <font FACE="Arial">writeUTF()</font>
and read with <font FACE="Arial">readUTF().</font>
<p>
<li>The <font FACE="Arial">Class</font> class can be used
to obtain a description of a class which can be used to write
to and read from heterogeneous streams.
