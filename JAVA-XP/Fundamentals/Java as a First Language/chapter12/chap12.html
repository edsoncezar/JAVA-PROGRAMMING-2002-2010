<h1>Chapter 12 Streams<br>
</h1>

<p>
In the programs which have been presented so far all input to
the program has come from the keyboard and all output has been
sent to the screen. To be more useful an application may have
to accept data from, and send data to, a wide variety of other
sources and destinations. These might include disk files, printers,
modems, fax machines, network connections and other processes
running on the same, or a different, machine. Information is considered
to flow from, or to, the device as a sequence of data items known
as a <i><b>stream</b></i> of data.<br>

<p>
The detailed consideration of the use of streams to connect with
a variety of devices is beyond the scope of this book. Accordingly
only the use of files on the local disc drive will be considered;
the use of streams to connect with other devices is fundamentally
very similar. The use of files will address another limitation
of the programs which have been introduced so far; that is, any
information which has been input has been lost as soon as the
program finishes. This is rarely appropriate and most specifications
require that information input during one run of a program is
stored in a file in order that it can be made available to the
same program when it is run again, or by another program in order
to further process the information.<br>

<p>
When considering the use of disc files a distinction needs to
be made between files which are intended to be readable by humans
and files which are intended only to be used by programs. Files
which are readable by humans are known as <i><b>text&nbsp;files</b></i>,
those intended only to be used by other programs are known as
<i><b>binary&nbsp;files</b></i>. Binary files have the advantage
of usually being smaller than the equivalent text files. However
the binary files produced by a particular compiler are not necessarily
readable by a program produced by a different compiler and in
these situations text files can also be used to transfer information
between programs.<br>

<p>
One final aspect of communication with a program will also be
introduced in this chapter, communication with the program from
the command line. This facility is very often used with operating
system command line programs. For example when the command <i>copy
this.file that.file</i> is issued at the system prompt, it can
be thought of as starting a program called <i>copy</i> and passing
to it the arguments <i>this.file </i>and<i> that.file.</i> Any
additional information on the command line, following the name
of the program, is made available to the <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">main()</font></i>
action in the array of <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">String</font>s,
conventionally called <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">args[]</font></i>,
which must form part of <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">main</font></i>'s
signature. <br>
