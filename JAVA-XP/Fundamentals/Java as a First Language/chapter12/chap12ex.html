<h2>Exercises for Chapter 12<br>
</h2>

<h3>
<ul>

<p>
12.1 Obtain and demonstrate the <i><font FACE="Arial">TextFileDemo</font></i>,
<i><font FACE="Arial">Type</font></i> and <i><font FACE="Arial">NumberList</font></i>
programs then build and demonstrate them.<br>

<p>
12.2 Adapt the <i><font FACE="Arial">Type</font></i> program
so that it takes an arbitrary number of arguments and iteratively
outputs all of the files which they identify to the screen.<br>

<p>
12.3 Adapt the <i><font FACE="Arial">Type</font></i> program
from 12.2 so that if it is not given any arguments it asks the
user for the filename, with an iterative dialog, until they enter
the name of a file which can be opened.<br>

<p>
12.4 Implement a program which writes an indeterminate number
of random integer values to a text file. Implement a second program
which reads the integers from the file and outputs on the screen
the number of integers in the file, the highest value, the lowest
value and the floating point average value.<br>

<p>
12.5 Extend the <i><font FACE="Arial">NumberList</font></i>
class to produce a <i><font FACE="Arial">PageList</font></i>
class. This class should encapsulate a page number attribute and
its own line number attribute. Every fifty lines it should output
three blank lines, a line containing the file name and page number
and three more blan lines. The lines which form the page break
should not be numbered.<br>

<p>
12.6 Extend the <i><font FACE="Arial">RoomMonitor</font></i>
class to produce an <i><font FACE="Arial">ExtendedRoomMonitor</font></i>
class. This class should not introduce any data attributes and
need only supply a <i><font FACE="Arial">toString()</font></i>
action which clearly identifies it as an <i><font FACE="Arial">ExtendedRoomMonitor</font></i>.
Adapt the <i><font FACE="Arial">HeterogeneousMonitors</font></i>
class so that it can create instances of this class in the array
and demonstrate that this is all that is needed for the class
to be written and saved.<br>

<p>
12.7 Design and implement a menu driven program which provides
access to the <i><font FACE="Arial">HeterogeneousMonitors</font></i>
class. It should offer options to reinitialise, to show the display
the structure on the screen, to write it to a file named by the
user and to read the structure from a file named by the user.
Use this client to demonstrate that a file produced by one run
of the program can be used by a subsequent run of the program.
