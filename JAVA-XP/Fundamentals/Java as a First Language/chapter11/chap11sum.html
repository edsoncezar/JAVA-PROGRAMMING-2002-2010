<h2>Chapter 11 summary<br>
</h2>

<h3>
<ul>
<li>Testing can only increase confidence in the correct implementation
of the artefact, it cannot prove that the artefact is correct.
<p>
<li>Testing can be used to assure the quality of the artefact
but, by itself, cannot introduce quality characteristics into
the artefact.
<p>
<li>The quality of a test process depends upon the quality of
the rationale.
<p>
<li>There are two approaches to testing, black box and glass box.
<p>
<li>Black box testing can use inverse, composite, relational and
parallel techniques.
<p>
<li>Parallel techniques can always be used, but the techniques
should be favoured in the sequence inverse, composite, relational
and parallel.
<p>
<li>Automated test harnesses increase the costs of testing but
pay off in an increased ease of (re)applying the tests.
<p>
<li>Testing is not a mechanistic process.
