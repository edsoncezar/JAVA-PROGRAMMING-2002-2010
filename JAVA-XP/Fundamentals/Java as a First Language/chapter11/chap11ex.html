<h2>Exercises for Chapter 11<br>
</h2>
<h3>
<ul>
<p>
<p>
11.1 Is the <i><font FACE="Arial">JulianDate</font></i>
hierarchy now adequately tested? If so do you have a greater confidence
in it than in the hierarchies which have been previously introduced?
<br>

<p>
11.2 Choose one of the hierarchies which have been developed in
the previous chapters and produce a black box rationale and test
harness for it. Does this process increase your confidence in
the quality of the implementation? <br>

<p>
11.3 Produce flowgraphs for all the actions in <i><font FACE="Arial">JulianDate</font></i>
hierarchy. Review all the flowgraphs and determine if there is
a relationship between the complexity of the flowgraphs and your
difficulty in understanding the implementation. <br>

<p>
11.4 Produce flowgraphs for the hierarchy used in exercise 11.2
and use them to review the black box test plans. Have the flowgraphs
indicated any tests which were not covered by the black box plans?
<br>

<p>
11.5 If you decided that the <i><font FACE="Arial">JulianDate</font></i>
hierarchy was adequately tested in exercise 11.1, run the interactive
<i><font FACE="Arial">JulianDateTestHarness</font></i>
again and input the string 5/5/1900/1999. What does this tell
you about the process of testing?<br>
<br>
