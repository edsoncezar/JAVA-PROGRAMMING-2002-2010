<h1>Chapter 11 Testing Software<br>
</h1>

<p>
In previous chapters client programs have been provided to <i><b>demonstrate</b></i>
that the artefacts produced appear to be working correctly. This
is not altogether satisfactory and this chapter will introduce
techniques by which artefacts can be <i><b>tested</b></i> to improve
the confidence that they are implemented correctly. However techniques
to provide an absolute <i><b>proof</b></i> that an artefact has
been implemented correctly are beyond the scope of this book,
and are very difficult and expensive to apply in practice.<br>

<p>
One way of obtaining such a proof is to use exhaustive testing;
however this approach is impossible in all but the simplest situations.
Taking the <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">tomorrow</font></i>()
action from the <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">JulianDate</font></i>()
package as an example: in order to test this exhaustively all
possible dates between the 1<sup>st</sup>  January 1900 and the
31<sup>st</sup> December 1999 would have to be demonstrated to
be working correctly. This would involve applying a total of 109573
trials, all of which would have to be checked to make sure that
they were not faulty. Even though this might just be possible,
this is only one of 25 actions in the <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">JulianDates</font></i>
hierarchy all of which would require a similar approach.<br>

<p>
As exhaustive testing is clearly impractical all that can be done
is to demonstrate that the artefact appears to be correct on a
set of trials and supply an argument that the set chosen is sufficiently
representative of all possibilities for the confidence in the
correct operation of the artefact to be acceptable. The argument
to support the contention that the set is representative is known
as a <i><b>test rationale</b></i>. <br>

<p>
There are two fundamental approaches to producing a test rational.
One which relies only upon the specification of the artefact,
known as <i><b>black box</b></i> testing. The second approach
relies upon an understanding of the implementation and is known
as <i><b>glass box</b></i> testing. This chapter will introduce
the techniques of black box testing in detail and conclude with
a brief consideration of glass box testing.<br>
