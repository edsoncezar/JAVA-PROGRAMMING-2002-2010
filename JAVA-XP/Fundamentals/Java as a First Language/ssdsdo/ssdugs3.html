<h3><a name="L2">Short introduction to the unit</a></h3>
<div align=right><font size=small color=darkred><a href=#top>Return to top</a></font></div>

<p>Software Development is a difficult and complex process and learning how to
develop software is equally difficult and complex. Most students report that
software development is the most difficult of their first year classes.
Software Development is both an academic body of knowledge and a
practical skill. Just like other practical skills, such as riding a bicycle or driving
a car, it is not possible to learn the skill by reading about how to do it.
<H1><font color="red" ><div align=center>The only way to learn<br>
Software Development<br>
is to<br>
Develop Software!! <br></div></font></h1>
<p>The skills and knowledge involved in software development are fundamental
to your studies in the second and final years; and in particular is vital for your
final year project. When you graduate in computing you may never be
required ever to actually develop a software artifact, but every employer will
expect that you have a practical understanding of the process and minimal
skills in the process.
<p>
Even when you complete a computing degree you will only be qualified to
work as a junior developer and will require several years experience and
practice to progress. If you look at the pages of job adverts that appear in
national papers and in the weekly Computing newspaper you will discover
that the vast majority of the jobs on offer require both software development
skills and practical experience.

<h3><a name="L3">Aims of the unit</a></h3>
<div align=right><font size=small color=darkred><a href=#top>Return to top</a></font></div>
<p>The principal aim of this course is to provide a practical introduction to modern
software development theory, practice and techniques. Software is the
product that defines the computer industry and an understanding of the
processes by which software is developed is an essential requirement for
anyone who hopes to work in the computer industry.
<p>This is recognized in the course regulations which place a particular emphasis
upon students successfully completing both first year software development
units (this unit and the semester 2 unit Software Development with Objects
CSD-1-SDO) before proceeding to year 2. Software development units will
continue to be a core theme throughout the remainder of the computing
courses in the school.


<h3><a name="L4">The learning outcomes for the unit</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Use a simple integrated software development environment.
  <li>Use appropriate graphical notations to describe and design software.
  <li>Demonstrate that artifacts appear to be implemented correctly.
  <li>Practice development by extension.
  <li>Employ appropriate features of an OO language to implement requirements.
  <li>Produce documentation describing both the product and its production process.
  <li>Make suitable use of existing resources.
  <li>Log and reflect upon individual learning progress.
</ol>

<h3><a name="L5">Key and cognitive skills</a></h3>
<div align=right><font size=small color=darkred><a href=#top>Return to top</a></font></div>
Specifically by the end of this course you should be able to:

 <ol>
  <li>operate an NT workstation and manage your NT environment.
  <li>produce a program design from a program specification.
  <li>implement the program design making use of pre-supplied components.
  <li>demonstrate that the implementation conforms with the specification.
  <li>produce documentation to support and describe the software produced.
  <li>extend the facilities of a pre-supplied software component.
</ol>



<h3><a name="L6">Introduction to studying this unit</a></h3>

<p>Software Development is a complex skill that can only be perfected by
practical activity. To this end you will be expected to spend much of your time
designing and implementing software. Only one hour a week will be used for
lectures, the remaining three hours contact time will be devoted to lab-based
workshops. You will be also expected to spend at least another four hours a
week practicing these skills.

<h3>Syllabus</h3>

<p>This unit will run for 15 weeks starting in February 2002 and ending in June
2002. The first 13 weeks will be contact weeks the remaining 2 will be used
for assessment.
<p>The majority of the time allocation for the unit will be spent in workshops,
where you are expected to progress through your learning plan at your own
pace. It is your responsibility to keep your tutor informed of your progress and
in particular to ensure that you are formally assessed at the waypoints.

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>At the start of the unit you will be assigned to a software development tutor
who will staff the workshop and who will assess your progress. The tutor's
availability will be made clear during the first meeting.
<p>The team as opposed to your tutor will communicate with you via messages
on course notice boards, e- mail into your account and/ or messages on the
Web and discussion group. We will assume that a message sent by any of
these methods has been received by the entire group.

<p><b>NOTE:</b>   the student should understand that the guide, as shown above, is an
indication of how the course ideally fits into the structure of the semester.
Although every attempt will be made to try and follow this structure, there may
be times when it is impossible to do so. Students may be re-assured though,
that all the material listed will be covered.

<p><div align=center><font size=5 font-weight=600 color=darkred>Students MUST get at least 40% in coursework <br>AND
at least 40% in the examination to pass this unit.</font></div>

<h3>Exam format and instructions</h3>
  <div align=right><font size=small color=darkred><a href=#top>Return to top</a></font></div>
<p>The examination will be administered on-line and will consist of 50 multiple
choice questions.
<p>The waypoint 1 &amp 2 material has a number of on-line self-test multiple choice
quizzes. The questions in the examination will be similar to those provided.
The best way to prepare for the examination is to practice on the self-test
quizzes.


<h3>Waypoints</h3>

<p>There are three defined waypoints in the SSD unit. We expect you to reach
these waypoints at approximately weeks 5, 10 and 12. It is more important
that you have thoroughly understood all the material and completed all the
practical exercises, before the waypoint assessment; than to attempt to keep
to a schedule which is too fast for you. However it is also necessary for you to
complete all three waypoints by the end of the semester!
<p>To pass waypoints 1 and 2 you have to present your logbook which provides
evidence that you have completed all activities and will contain a summary
sheet which you fill out to show this. You will also have to take a short test
and to complete a practical development exercise, during a lab session.
<p>Waypoint 1 and waypoint 2 have 10 marks for the logbook, 5 marks for the
test and 15 marks for the practical exercise. You should aim to get at least 20
marks in total. The table below gives the dates when the waypoint 1 &amp 2
assessments will be conducted.
<p>Waypoint 3 consists of a complete design, build and document exercise and
is worth 40 marks.

<h3>Early Referral</h3>

<p>In recognition of the fundamental nature of the skills taught by this unit the
B.Sc. Computing course regulations allow for an early referral in software
development. Students who do not pass this unit in semester 2 will not be
allowed to take the second semester Software Development with Objects
(CSD-1-SDO) in semester 3, but will be required to re-take this unit in
semester 3.
<p>Students who fail either the coursework or examination part of the
assessment will be offered an opportunity to redeem the failure in the last
week of semester 2 or the first week of semester 3. This will involve retaking
the examination and completing a lab-based practical assessment.

<p>Students who fail this unit in semester 2 will be expected to redeem the failure
by re-attempting the waypoint and examination assessments in semester 3.

<h3>Logbooks</h3>
 <div align=right><font size=small color=darkred><a href=#top>Return to top</a></font></div>
<p>Your are expected to maintain a logbook. In it you should make an entry every
time you do some work on a terminal which contributes towards a waypoint.
The entry should:
<b><b><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#800000"><ol>
  <li>Indicate what you intend to achieve.
  <li>Indicate what you did to achieve it.
  <li>Indicate what problems you had achieving it.
  <li>Indicate what questions you have on what you have done.
  <li>Indicate what you intend to do next.
</ol></font></b></b>
<p>Your logbook should not be a notebook. That is it should not contain
summaries from the text book or from the web material. It should not contain
program designs or listings or scripts of program runs. It is an executive
summary of your learning activities.

<p><div align=center><font size=5 font-weight=600 color=darkred>The logbook must be a live document
which records your own work!</font></div>

<p>You should make an entry in the logbook every time you do a significant
activity connected with the unit, not just during the weekly practical classes.
You should bring your logbook to every practical class so that you tutor can
assess and sign it. Logbooks will no be assessed or signed at any other
time.


<cite>An example logbook entry might be as follows.
(This example is illustrative not perscriptive!)</cite>

<pre><i><font color="darkgreen">25 October 2000 LRC 5.00 pm
I intend to make up an activity to do at the end of waypoint 1 because I heard
ny tutor say 'well done!' to somone who had done just that. I will adding a
changing temperature called hotDay to the demonstration, set it to 25 degrees
centigrade and then taking it up to 30 degrees centigrade, showing it and
saying it is getting hotter wach time. Like this:
	The value of hotDay is 25 degrees centigrade
 	It is getting hotter, it is now 26 degrees centigrade
	. . . and so on. . .
When I typed it in it first said:
	Error No entity named "hotday" was found in this environment
I puzzled over this for half an hour as I knew I had constructed something
called hotday but I could not get it fixed. Then I phoned my firend and he said
that I had not spelled hotday properly - but I checked and I had. Then I
noticed it hotday is not the same as hotDay.
When I fixed this it then gave the error:
	Syntax: ";" inserted to complete ExpressionStatement
I know this one! It means that I need to put a semi-colon at the end of that
line. (But it seems to say that it has already done so).

Today I learned that when the compiler says:
	Error No entity named something was found . . .
Then it doesn't know what something is and it could be bacause I have
spelled something differently or because I have confused UPPER and lower
letters again!!</font></i></pre>

<p>The usefulness of this entry is that the student has written down
something that can be used later if they hit a similar problem.



<h3><a name="L8">Learning support material</a></h3>
 <div align=right><font size=small color=darkred><a href=#top>Return to top</a></font></div>
<p>The set book for this, and its follow-on unit SDO, is
<br>
<b>'Java: An Object First
Approach', Fintan Culwin, Prentice Hall 1998, ISBN 0-13-858457-5.</b> This book
is no longer available, but a copy of it is included on the BURKS CD (see
below).
<p>The majority of the material which you will need is available on the SBU Web
server. During your first sessions your tutor will help you to get started with
accessing and using this material.
<p>Course materials can be obtained via the internet home page at <br>
<a href="schedulepage.html">
www.scism.sbu.ac.uk/jfl/ssdsdo/schedulepage.html</a>,<br>which contains
example programs and other documents which are available for student use.
You will be directed by the lecturers and tutors to look for certain files in the
team area when they are required.
<p>The Java development environment, Ready to Program, is available for home
use on the <b>intranet</b> at <br><a href="http://www.sbu.ac.uk/jfl/ready_download">
www.sbu.ac.uk/jfl/ready_download</a><br> Notice that this will require 8 floppy disks
if you do not have a zip drive.
<p>A free Java development environment (Sun JDK) and program editor (PFE),
is available. To run it you will need a pentium pc with at least 16 Megs of RAM
and about 90 Meg spare disc space running Windows 95 or NT. The easiest
way to obtain it is to buy a copy of the <b>BURKS 6 CD (£7.50)</b>, available from
Blackwell's bookshop. (This CD also contains a large number of other
resources that you might find useful throughout your degree.)
