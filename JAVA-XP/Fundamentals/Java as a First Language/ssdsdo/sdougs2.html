<p><b>Introduction : Learning by doing! </b></p>

<p align="center"><b>This unit will continue the theme,
organisation and structure <br>
of the preceding SSD unit. Insofar as it is possible you will
have <br>
the same tutor as in the first semester.</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You are reminded that Software Development is both an
    academic body of knowledge and a practical skill. Just like
    other practical skills, such as riding a bicycle or driving a
    car, it is not possible to learn the skill by reading about
    how to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>The only way
to learn Software Development<br>
is to Develop Software!!</b></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The truth of this statement should be clear from your
    previous Software Development unit(s) and the necessity of
    scheduling your time so as to be able to make the most
    effective use of the learning resources should also be
    apparent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Aims and Objectives </b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The initial level of knowledge and skill provided by the
    preceding SSD unit will be further developed in this unit.
    Software development is seen as an intellectual skill and the
    development of skills requires continual practise and
    extension. Several additional aspects will be introduced in
    this unit allowing artefacts to communicate more effectively
    with their environment and to operate concurrently. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Learning Outcomes</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>On completion of this unit the student should be able to: </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Appreciate the needs of a human user and design
            appropriately. </li>
        <li>Use and implement objects which contain a number of
            other objects. </li>
        <li>Output the state of an object, in a number of
            different ways. </li>
        <li>Input the state of an object which has previously
            been output. </li>
        <li>Implement a simple object which can safely operate
            concurrently. </li>
        <li>Implement an object which can respond to the receipt
            of events. </li>
        <li>Describe an artefact which has a GUI in terms of a
            three-layer model. </li>
        <li>Implement and demonstrate a simple GUI driven
            artifact. </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Studying this unit</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Software Development is a complex skill that can only be
    perfected by practical activity. To this end you will be
    expected to spend much of your time designing and
    implementing software. Only one hour a week will be used for
    lectures, the remaining three hours contact time will be
    devoted to lab-based workshops. You will be also expected to
    spend at least another four hours a week practising these
    skills. <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Organisation and structure</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This unit will run for 15 weeks starting in February 2000
    and ending in May 2000. The first 12 weeks will be contact
    weeks the remaining 3 will be used for assessment. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The majority of the time allocation for the unit will be
    spent in workshops, where you are expected to progress
    through your learning plan at your own pace. It is your
    responsibility to keep your tutor informed of your progress
    and in particular to ensure that you are formally assessed at
    the <i>waypoints</i>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Communications</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>At the start of the unit you will be assigned to a
    software development tutor who will staff the workshop and
    who will assess your progress. The tutor's availability will
    be made clear during the first meeting. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The team as opposed to your tutor will communicate with
    you via messages on course notice boards, e- mail into your
    account and/ or messages on the Web and discussion group. We
    will assume that a message sent by any of these methods has
    been received by the entire group. </p>

<p><b>Resources</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The set book for this, and its follow-on unit SDO, is 'Java:
    An Object First Approach', Fintan Culwin, Prentice Hall 1998,
    ISBN 0-13-858457-5. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The majority of the material which you will need is
    available on the SBU Web server. During your first sessions
    your tutor will help you to get started with accessing and
    using this material. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is an account on the CSD Unix machine called <i>jfl</i>,
    which contains example programs and other documents which are
    available for student use. You will be directed by the
    lecturers and tutors to look for certain files in the team
    area when they are required. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>A <i>free</i> Java development environment (Sun JDK) and
    program editor (PFE), is available. To run it you will need a
    pentium pc with at least 8 Megs of RAM and about 30 Meg spare
    disc space running Windows 95 or NT. The easiest way to
    obtain it is to buy a copy of the BURKS 4 CD (£5.00),
    available from Blackwell&#146;s bookshop. (This CD also
    contains a large number of other resources that you might
    find useful throughout your degree.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Waypoints</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There are three defined <i>waypoints</i> in the SSD unit.
    We expect you to reach these waypoints at approximately weeks
    4, 9 and 12. It is more important that you have thoroughly
    understood all the material and completed all the practical
    exercises, before you ask for a waypoint assessment; than to
    attempt to keep to a schedule which is too fast for you.
    However it is also necessary for you to complete all three
    waypoints by the end of the semester!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To pass waypoints 4 and 6 you have to present your
    workbook which provides evidence that you have completed all
    activities and will contain a summary sheet which you fill
    out to show this. You will also have to take a short test and
    to complete a practical development exercise, during a lab
    session.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Waypoint 4 and waypoint 6 have 10 marks for the workbook,
    10 marks for the test and 10 marks for the practical exercise.
    <b><i>To pass a waypoint you have to get at least 20 marks in
    total</i></b>. The table below gives the last date by which
    you must submit for your waypoint 4 &amp; 6 assessments. If
    you obtain less than 20 marks on your first attempt at either
    of these assessments you can have a second attempt in the
    following week, so long as this is not later than the last
    allowed date, to obtain a maximum of 20 marks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Waypoint 5 consists of a complete design, build and
    document exercise and is worth 40 marks. </p>

    <dir>
        <li>Indicate what you intend to achieve. </li>
        <li>Indicate what you did to achieve it. </li>
        <li>Indicate what problems you had achieving it. </li>

    is it should not contain summaries from the text book or from
    the web material. It should not contain program designs or
    listings or scripts of program runs. It is an executive
    summary of your learning activities. </p>
