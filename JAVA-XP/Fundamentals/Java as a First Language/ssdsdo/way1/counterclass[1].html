<h1>A Simple Class</h1>

<p>Here is a simple example Java class </p>

<pre>

  <strong>public class</strong> SimpleCounter <strong>extends</strong> Object{
      <strong>private int </strong>count;
  	             <span class="comment">// the constructor</span>
      <strong>public</strong> SimpleCounter (<strong>int</strong> startValue){
         count = startValue;
      }<span class="comment">  // End constructor</span>

	             <span class="comment">// a simple method </span>
      <strong>public void </strong>click (){
         count++;
      }<span class="comment">  // End click()</span>

	             <span class="comment">// a 'getter'</span>
      <strong>public int </strong>getValue(){
          <strong>return</strong> count;
      }<span class="comment">  // End getValue()</span>
  }<span class="comment">  // End class SimpleCounter</span>

</pre>

<div class="stress">What is it called?</div>

<p>It is called <span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span>.<br>
Notice that names used in Java are case sensitive so that
<span class="reserv">simpleCounter</span> and
<span class="reserv">Simplecounter</span> are different</p>

<div class="stress">What does it do?</div>

<p>Well it is not a complete program so it will not run. In fact it will not do anything at all.
It is not meant to! It is a description of something we might create later. A description of
a component which may be part of a much larger system, the description is called a
<strong class="nameit">class</strong>.  Using this description, we will later create instances
which make up a system.  These are called <strong class="nameit">objects.</strong>.
</p>

<p>You might want to think of it this way. An object can be considered to be a software
component which can provide services to other components in system. The code above is
a <em>description</em> of one of those components</p>

<div class="stress">What does it mean?</div>

<p>It lets the system know what attributes will be stored inside a <span
class="reserv">Simplecounter</span> object. It also says what a
<span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span>
object can do.</p>



<p>A <strong class="nameit">class</strong> is a description of the attributes and methods
available to an <strong class="nameit">object</strong> </p>

<p>So here is a more detailed description of the code above</p>

<p>The class announces to the world that when an object of class
<span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span> is created, it will
contain within it an integer called <span class="reserv">count</span>
and an object of this kind can <strong>only</strong> perform the
actions <span class="reserv">click()</span>, <span class="reserv">getValue()</span>
and finally the constructor method <span class="reserv">SimpleCounter()</span>
which initialises the object when it is created.
There may be many objects of this kind in our final system.</p>

<p><img src="images\simpleclass.gif" width="441" height="303"> Click to see this in <a
href="uml_eg.html#Simple">UML</a></p>

<p>The integer variable called 'count' is <strong class="nameit">encapsulated</strong>
within the object, and can only be accessed by the supplied <strong class="nameit">methods</strong></p>

<div class="stress">How can I use it?</div>

<p>By creating another class which can be executed (It contains a method called
<span class=reserv>main()</span>). Here is such a class that makes a
<span class=reserv>SimpleCounter</span>
object, of the kind we described above.</p>

<pre>
<strong>public class</strong> SimpleCounterDemonstration <strong> extends </strong> Object{
	
	<strong>public static void</strong> main (String[] args){
	
		 SimpleCounter count = new SimpleCounter(21);
		 
		 System.out.print(&quot;First  count  : &quot;);
		 System.out.println(count.getcount());
		 count.click();
		 System.out.print(&quot;Second count  : &quot;);
		 System.out.println(count.getcount());
		 count.click();
		 count.click();
		 System.out.print(&quot;Third  count  : &quot;);
		 System.out.println(count.getcount());
	 } <span class="comment">// End of main</span>
} <span class="comment">// End of class SimpleCounterDemonstration</span>
</pre>
 <p>Download the file <a href="source\simplecounterdemonstration.java">here</a></p>
<div class="stress"> Working through the code a step at a time</div>

<pre><strong>public class</strong> SimpleCounterDemonstration {
	
	<strong>public static void</strong> main (String[] args){
</pre>

<p>The new class called <span class="reserv">SimpleCounterDemonstration</span> is defined
which contains within it a <span class="reserv"><span>main()</span></span> method. The <span
class="reserv"><span>main()</span></span> method is the start point for an application</p>

<pre>		 SimpleCounter count = new SimpleCounter(21);</pre>

<p>An object of class <span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span> is created. The object is
referenced by the name <span class="reserv">count</span>. In making an <strong
class="nameit">instance</strong> of the object, we call the constructor, passing it the
count 21. If all goes to plan, we should have an object with count of 21 stored in its <span
class="reserv">count</span> variable. Everything we specified in the <span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span>
class is here in this object.</p>

<pre>		 System.out.print(&quot;First  count  : &quot;);
		 System.out.println(count.getcount());</pre>

<p>Writes to the screen, the string of characters <span class="reserv">&quot;First count :
&quot;,</span> then displays the count returned from the object, by asking the object to <span
class="reserv">getcount()</span></p>

<p><span class="reserv">println()</span> appends an end of line character so that the
cursor moves onto the next line ready for the next output.</p>

<pre>		 count.click();</pre>

<p>Ask the <span class="reserv">count</span> object to execute its <span class="reserv">click()</span>
<strong class="nameit">method</strong> . That is, send object <span
class="reserv">count</span> a <strong class="nameit">message</strong> to <span
class="reserv">click()</span> this should increment the count held in the object called <span
class="reserv">count</span> </p>

<pre>		 System.out.print(&quot;Second count  : &quot;);
		 System.out.println(count.getcount());
</pre>

<p>Following through the rest of the code it should be obvious that the output will be </p>

<pre class="output">
First  count = 21
Second count = 22
Third count  = 24
</pre>

<div class="stress">Things to try</div>

<ol class="tasks">
  <li>Modify the class <span class="reserv">SimpleCounterDemonstration</span> to create a
    second <strong class="nameit">instance</strong> of class <span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span>
    called <span class="reserv">myCount</span>. Give it an initial count of 5, and write
    sufficient statements in the <span class="reserv">main()</span> method to convince
    yourself of its its actions. It is important you realise that you <strong>do not</strong>
    have to modify the original class to <strong class="nameit">reuse</strong> it.</li>
  <li>Modify the class <span class="reserv">SimpleCounter</span> so that it has a new method
      called <span class="reserv">add2()</span>, that adds 2 to the <span class="reserv">count</span>.  Then modify the class <span class="reserv">SimpleCounterDemonstration</span> to demonstrate the action of the method.</li>
  <li>Make sure you understand all the <strong class="nameit">terms</strong> used above. <ol>
    </ol>
  </li>
