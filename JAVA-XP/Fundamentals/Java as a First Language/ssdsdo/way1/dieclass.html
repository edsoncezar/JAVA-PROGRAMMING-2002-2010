 The Problem</p></div>
 <table border=0><tr><td width="80%">
 We would like to create a Die class for a game. This should
 be created so that it will be useful for any games we might
 create in the future which require dice.</td>

Answers are available on the link at the end of this page,
but you will benefit much more if you try all the stages first.    <hr>
 <p class="tasklist">Tasks:</p>


  <ol class="tasks">
    <li>For the Die Class, first answer the following questions
    <ol type="a">
        <li> What value(s) will it hold?  What types of values?</li>
        <li> What does an object of type Die do?  What methods will it have?</li>
        <li> Do <em>all</em> dice have the same number of sides for <em>all</em>
        games?  What is the implication of this answer?</li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li> Try to draw a class diagram for the Die Class</li>
    <li> Using previous examples as a starting point, write a Java class for
          the Die class</li>
    <li> Write a demonstration program to illustrate the action of the Die
          objects <sup>*</sup></li>
    <li> <em>Advanced : </em>Extend the Die class to create a new class that contains
    both a minimum and maximum value.  The random values returned must be within this 
    range.  The minimum and maximum values can both be set on creation of an object, 
    or if no parameters are provided, the default values should be 1 and 6 respectively.
    Also supply methods which will allow the user to change the minimum and maximum 
    values.</li> 
    <li> <em>Advanced : </em>Draw a class diagram for this new class</li>
    <li> <em>Advanced : </em>Create a demonstration program which fully shows the action 
    of at least 2 objects of this class.</li>
 
  </ol>

  * You might find it useful to create a random number, by using :<br>

  <tt> result = (int)(Math.random()* maxValue)+ 1;</tt><br>
  Which will put integer between 1 and the value held in maxValue inclusive
  into the variable called result. </font>
