  <li>You need to create a set of directories to work in on the local machine and on your
    floppy disks</li>
  <li>Work with files on the hard disk whenever possible and make lots of back-ups</li>
  <li>There are secure drives on the network where you can store your work and these are one
    of the preferred areas to keep your work because it will then be available wherever you
    are in the University, and will not be available to other students</li>
  <li>Only store work on floppies when transporting it to and from the University, or to make
    back-ups of your work. It is a bad idea to use a floppy disk as your default drive with
    the compiler or with say a Word Processor, Spreadsheet or Database. (Floppies are not as
    reliable as hard disks and there <em>will</em> come a time when the floppy becomes
    unreadable)...</li>
