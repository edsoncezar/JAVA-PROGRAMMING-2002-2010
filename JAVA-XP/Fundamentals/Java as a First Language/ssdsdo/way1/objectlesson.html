"Don't panic",
"If you are having trouble ",
"With basic computer skills",
"Go to the Learning Resource Centre",
"There is a lot of help there",
"for anyone who wants to learn",
"Now lets look at this first waypoint",
"There is no need to worry about Objects",
"So don't panic",
"There's nothing hard about using Objects",
"I mean.... it's just like in real life, isn't it?",
"The world is full of objects",
"With objects you can describe",
"What they are.....",
"....and what they can do.....",
"You can describe a whole bunch of objects",
"As a *class*",
"A *class* is just a description of something.",
"...and an *object* is one of those somethings",
"O.K. so they use other words to describe it",
"like",
"An object is an instance of a class",
"... but that's just like",
"'my pen'",
"is an instance of 'all pens'",
"So 'my pen' is an object",
"and it belongs to the *class* of 'all pens'",
"that's all there is ",
"I don't see what all the fuss is about",
"Who are they kidding???",
"'An object is an instance of a class",
"... that has state and behaviour'",
"Like that's hard!",
"The *state* is all the values the object holds",
"...at that moment",
"as the values change",
"so does the state",
"A 19 year old is in the state",
"of being a teenager",
"We know this because the value",
"in the attribute called Age",
"has a certain value",
"When that value changes",
"... on the 20th Birthday",
"The state of that person changes",
"and they are no longer a teenager",
"So the state depends on all the *values*",
"in the *attributes*",
".......combined",
"..................at that moment",
"That's all",
"They like to call the names of the values 'attributes'",
"We know what they mean!",
"If you were an object in a computer",
"you would have attributes",
"like ---",
"an attribute called Name",
".....that might have a value 'Fred'",
"Everyone has an attribute called Name",
"but not everyone has the value 'Fred'",
"or you have an attribute for your Age",
"or an attribute for your Address",
"just as in real life!",
"I bet you could think of other attributes",
"that describe you",
"not all of them would fit into a computer program",
"Like how nice your voice sounds",
".........or how you smell",
"...... charming I'm sure",
"....",
"and an objects behaviour....",
"It's just too easy...",
"the *behaviour* is what an object can do,",
"...and to some extent what can cause it to do it",
"and these are described in the *methods* in the class",
"And they seem to make a big deal about all this",
"I don't know why",
"So remember...",
"'An object is an instance of a class",
"... that has state and behaviour'",
"     ",
"Oh yeh,..... there is also that special method",
"the one thats called when a new object is created",
"it's called the *constructor*",
"but you can always tell it's a constructor because",
"the constructor has the same name as the class",
"....",
"Then there's Java.",
"So what's the big mystery there?",
"We start with a Java file that we write",
"that has the same name",
"as the one we choose for the java class",
"So if I want to write a class called 'Hello'",
"I would have to store it",
"in a file called 'Hello.java'",
"This is called the *source code*",
"and from that file",
"the java *compiler* creates *bytecode*",
"which ends up in a file with a name that ends .class",
"In my case that would be 'Hello.class'",
"That's just something the *interpreter* can understand",
"You see ",
"We want this to work on all sorts of computer",
"So we use bytecode",
"which is not a real computers machine language",
"Well not yet anyway",
"And as long as we have an interpreter",
"On whatever machine...",
"...it should still run",
"because all the interpreters (JVMs)",
"understand bytecode",
".......",
"You have developed these programs",
"using an IDE",
"that's an Integerated Development Environment",
"that includes the Editor",
"...and the Compiler",
"......and the Debugger",
"and the ability to run the programs,",
"so it has it's own interpreter",
"Theres more to it than that,",
"But you can find that out in the lecturers,",
"right??",
"make sure you understand all that",
"public and private stuff too",
"They are sure to stick a question in there!!!",
"And how those diagrams fit together",
"if you really want to score",
"make sure you have done all the examples too",
"...and it's all written in your logbook",
"You know",
"You learn this subject by doing it!",
"You learn how to program...",
"...........by programming",
"there is no easy way out there",
"the more you do.......",
"..........the better you get",
"........",
"It is no real surprise to you",
"I'm sure",
"that the assessment needs you",
"to compile a Java class",
"then in another file",
"make an object of that class",
"...to show it working",
"Just like the examples we asked you to do!",
"......",
"so make sure you have done all the examples",
"........",
"Now this was a simple description",
"and you should try to understand at least the words",
"marked out with *---*",
"then.....",
"Your next step is to use all the words",
"In the correct way",
"Well,",
"I hope that helped",
"but I'll say it all again",
"just for you"
