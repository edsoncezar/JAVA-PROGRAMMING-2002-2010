<h1>Usernames and passwords</h1>

<p>This section tells you how to <strong class="nameit">logon </strong>to the NT
workstations, how&nbsp; to change your password and how to <strong class="nameit">logout </strong>again.
It also contains&nbsp; some advice about how to keep your account secure. Before
attempting this part&nbsp; of the booklet you should have received a account sheetfrom
your&nbsp; software tutor which contains details of your <strong class="nameit">username</strong>
and&nbsp; <strong class="nameit">password</strong>. </p>

<p><strong class="nameit">Logging on</strong> to a computer system means making a
connection from&nbsp; the computer in one of the labs to a remote computer or more
generally to a network. <strong class="nameit">Logging out</strong>&nbsp; means closing
that connection and it is essential that you logout every time you&nbsp; leave the
computer you are using so that nobody can use the machine and pretend&nbsp; to be you. In
order to log onto the system it needs to know who you&nbsp; are, and also to make sure
that you are who you say you are. </p>

<p>Your <strong class="nameit">username</strong> is how you identify yourself to the
remote computer. It is based upon your family name and is up to eight characters long. It
is the name by which you will be known to all SBU's computer systems and the name by which
you can receive and send electronic mail. Anyone can find out what your username is once
they know your personal name. </p>

<p>Your <strong class="nameit">password</strong> is how you prove to the system that it is
you who is attempting to log on, and not an imposter. It is rather like the four digit
code which you may have with your bank card. Anyone may find your card in the street but
without the four digit code they cannot get any money out of your account. Likewise anyone
may find out what your username is but without your password they will not be able to log
on to the system as if they were you. </p>

<p>It is important to make sure that you keep your password secret: 

<ul>
  <li>choose a password that you will be able to remember. </li>
  <li>choose a password which is at least six characters long. </li>
  <li>do not choose anything obvious like the name of your dog or your car registration.
  Childrens or friends names, football teams or silly words like 'PASSWORD' are the first
  to be tried</li>
  <li>you should include a digit {0 ..9} somewhere in the password, but do not include any
    spaces. </li>
  <li>do not write the password down. </li>
  <li>do not tell <font color="#ff0000"><strong><u>anyone</u></strong></font> what your
    password is. </li>
  <li>do not allow anyone to look over your shoulder while you are typing in your password. </li>
  <li>change your password on a regular basis, at least once per term. </li>
</ul>

<p>If you ever think that someone has found out what your password is, or that someone has
been making changes to your account, please contact your software tutor urgently. </p>
