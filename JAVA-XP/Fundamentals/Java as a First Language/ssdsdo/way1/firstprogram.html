<h1>Using the Compiler </h1>

<p>
First load up the Simple Java IDE by clicking on the 'Ready' icon<img src="images\icon.gif" width="90" height="60"> <br>
or from the start bar and you should find you are presented with the following screen. It has been chosen to be as simple as possible to get you programming right away</p>

<p><img src="images\ide1.gif" width="693" height="545">
</p>     <br>

<hr>

<p>You can start typing in a program in the white edit screen immediatly, or you can load
up a program from a file. </p>
<p><img src="images\ide2.gif" width="693" height="545"></p>
<ol class="tasks">
  <li>Click on the <em>OPEN</em> button and load up the file you saved in the previous section
    (<em>if you have not done that yet, go back and follow the instructions</em> <a
    HREF="beforestart[1].html#task">here</a>). <p>You should see the program in the editor as
    above<p> </li>

  <li>Run the program (select <em>RUN</em> from the menu or press <em>F1</em>) This will
    compile and run the program, showing the output in a new window.</li>
  <li>Close the output window and modify the original program so that it will display <pre
    class="output">
Goodbye friends 
from yourname
today is date
</pre>
    <p>using your name where it says <span class="reserv">yourname</span> and todays date
    where it says <span class="reserv">date</span> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file with a new name (Use File, SaveAs) </li>
</ol>

<p>It is important you know what is going on here. The program hides a lot of the details.</p>

<p><img src="images\compile.gif" width="601" height="282" border="0"></p>

<ul>
  <li>The source code you loaded and edited is visible in the <strong class="nameit">editor</strong>
    (<em>the white screen you type into</em>).</li>
  <li>If you select <strong class="nameit">Run -&gt; compile</strong> the program converts the
    <strong class="nameit">java source code</strong> into <strong class="nameit">java byte
    code</strong> storing it in a <strong class="nameit">.class</strong> file.</li>
  <li>When you <strong class="nameit">run</strong> the program, if the class file does not
    exist the source code is <strong class="nameit">compiled</strong> into <strong
    class="nameit">java byte code</strong> and the <strong class="nameit">java class</strong>
    file is passed on to a java <strong class="nameit">interpreter</strong> which runs it,
    along with other system classes, sending the results to the output window. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img src="images\compile2.gif" width="360" height="240"> </p>

<p>Instead of an executable file coming from a compiler and linker, as you would from C++
or Fortran for example, java is compiled into byte code format. these byte codes are then
executed by the virtual machine. The advantage is being able to run the byte code on any
machine which has a java virtual machine (JVM) available. Internet browsers such as
Netscape and Microsoft Internet explorer (MSIE) have a JVM within them allowing a type of
Java class called an applet to be downloaded over the internet and run locally.</p>

<p>We will explain programs like the above in more detail soon, but you should notice the
method <span class="reserv">main()</span> is the point where an application starts
execution</p>
