<h1 align="center">4.1 The public resources of the <font size="6"
face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font><font size="6"> class </font></h1>

<p>Figure 4.1 shows an instance of the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class contained within a very
simple demonstration harness, which will be introduced at the end
of this chapter. The harness supplies the text buttons at the
bottom of the application and reports the status of the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> at the top.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4.1</b> The <font face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
class within a simple user interface harness <br>
(with the drawing area reduced in height).</p>

<p>The feedback area at the top of the screen indicates that the
tuttle it is at x location ­105, y location 60, heading in
direction 300 and that its pen is up. The origin
(&nbsp;0,0&nbsp;) of the tuttle's <i>frame of reference</i> is
the centre of the screen and direction 0 indicates that it is
heading directly towards the top of the screen. The screen is
always 1000 tuttle steps wide and 1000 tuttle steps high, no
matter what the physical size of the screen might be.</p>

<p>Directions are measured in degrees and increase as the tuttle
rotates clockwise, so that a direction of 90<sup>o</sup> would
indicate that the tuttle is heading directly towards the right of
the screen. The representation of the tuttle changes to indicate
the direction in which it is heading and its color also changes
to indicate what color trail will be left when its pen is down.
The hexagon beside the tuttle was constructed by telling the
tuttle to move forwards and turn right by 60<sup>o</sup>, six
times; its pen was then raised and the tuttle moved clear of the
hexagon before the image was produced.</p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class
diagram is given in Figure 4.2.</p>

diagram.</font></p>

<p>A <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> instance
has six obvious data attributes: the tuttle's <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>xLocation</i></font>, <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>yLocation</i></font>
and its <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>direction</i></font> on
the screen, the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>currentForeground</i></font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>currentBackground</i></font>
color and its <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>penDown</i></font>,
either <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>true</b></font> or <font
size="2" face="Arial"><b>false</b></font>. There are a number of
other attributes within the class which will be described in
detail below. There are also a number of other methods, as
suggested by the dotted lines at the bottom of the diagram, which
will be introduced in Chapter 8.</p>

<p>The constructor creates a new <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
centred within an area whose physical <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>width</i></font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>height</i></font> are as
specified in its arguments. It also requires the identity of the
applet which it is executing within, for reasons which will be
explained below. The creation of a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
also includes calls of the two <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>private</b></font>
methods <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>initialiseTuttle()</i></font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>intitialiseCursor()</i></font>,
as will be described below.</p>

<p>The remaining methods are all concerned with the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>'s essential actions.
The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>forward()</i></font> and <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>backward()</i></font> methods move the
tuttle the number of tuttle steps specified in its current
direction, unless this would take it outside its area in which
case it is not moved. The steps are expressed in terms of the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>'s <i>virtual</i> size
which is always 1000 by 1000 steps and not in terms of its <i>physical</i>
size determined by its constructor.</p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>turnRight()</i></font> and <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>turnLeft()</i></font> methods rotate the
tuttle clockwise and anti-clockwise respectively, the argument
indicating the number of <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>degrees</i></font>
to turn. The tuttle cursor will be always rotated to indicate the
direction in which the tuttle will move forwards. The <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>clearArea()</i></font> method will clear
all drawings from the tuttle's drawing area by filling it with
the current background color, leaving the tuttle with its current
location and direction. The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset()</i></font>
method will move the tuttle back to the centre of the screen
(0,&nbsp;0) and set its direction to 0, without disturbing the
contents of the screen. The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>clearAndReset()</i></font>
method will combine the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>clearArea()</i></font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset()</i></font> methods to
fully restore the initial state. </p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>setForeground()</i></font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>setBackground()</i></font>
methods change the color of the tuttle and of its drawing area
respectively. When the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>setForeground()</i></font>
method is called the color of the tuttle cursor will change to
indicate the color which it will draw with. When the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>setBackground()</i></font> method is
called any parts of the drawing shown in the old background color
will be changed to the new background color. The <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>penUp()</i></font> and <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>penDown()</i></font> methods cause the tuttle to
leave, or not to leave, a trail as it moves. The final method, <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>getDetails()</i></font>, returns a
string of the form &quot;<i>x:&nbsp;nnn&nbsp;y:&nbsp;nnn&nbsp;d:&nbsp;nnn&nbsp;pen&nbsp;{up/&nbsp;down}</i>&quot;;
that is the virtual x and y location and the direction and the
state of the pen, either up or down, as shown at the top of
Figure 4.1.</p>

<p>The prototypes of the methods which are of interest to a
client, which needs only to control a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>,
are given in Table 4.1. </p>
