<blockquote>
    <p><strong>4.1</strong> Revisit the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>Doodle</i></font> application from Chapter 2
    and re-implement it to provide <i>save under</i> capability. </p>
    <p><strong>4.2</strong> Extend the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class to provide a facility
    to render a <font size="2" face="Arial">String</font> onto
    the drawing area at the current <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
    location. This will also require methods to support a <font
    size="2" face="Arial">Font</font> attribute to be provided. </p>
    <p><strong>4.3</strong> Re-implement the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class, removing the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>update()</i></font> method, so that
    the flickering effect becomes visible. </p>
    <p><strong>4.4</strong> Extend the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class to produce a <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>GeometricTuttle</i></font> class
    which has the capability to draw rectangles, polygons, ovals,
    arcs, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>4.5</strong> The execution of the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>Tuttle setBackground()</i></font> method can
    take some time even on a fast machine. One way to avoid the
    usability problems caused by nothing apparently happening is
    to process the image one row at a time. This will take longer
    but the user will see the background changing slowly from the
    top to the bottom of the drawing. Reimplement the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>setBackground()</i></font> method
    making use of this technique.</p>
    <p><strong>4.6</strong> Design and implement a <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>ColorValue</i></font> applet which contains
    three <font size="2" face="Arial">Scrollbar</font>s, a <font
    size="2" face="Arial">Canvas</font> and a <font size="2"
    face="Arial">Label</font>. The user should be able to
    interactively use the sliders to indicate the red, blue and
    green components of a color. The applet should respond by
    filling the <font size="2" face="Arial">Canvas</font> with
    the specified color and the <font size="2" face="Arial">Label</font>
    should display the hexadecimal RGB values.</p>
    <p><strong>4.6</strong> Implement an image processing class.
    This class should be capable of loading an image from a GIF
    file and then applying various filters to it. For example a
    color can be converted to its grey scale equivalent using the
    formula GG = (RR + GG + BB) /&nbsp;3 and then setting the RR,
    GG and BB bytes to GG. A cut off filter can then be produced
    which converts all pixels above a certain GG value to black
    and all below it to white. </p>
    <p><strong>4.7</strong> Extend the application from 4.5 to
    provide an image intensity histogram. The GG value is a
    measure of the intensity of the pixel and has a range of 0 to
    255. By counting the number of pixels from the image which
    have each possible intensity value and then displaying these
    numbers as lines of different heights an intensity histogram
    can be produced. </p>
    <p><strong>4.8</strong> The decision not to move the tuttle
    beyond the bounds of the virtual space was somewhat
    arbitrary. Other possible decisions might have been to move
    the tuttle up to the limits of the space rather than to
    refuse to move it at all, or to allow the tuttle to get lost
    in tuttle space reappearing when it moves back into view or
    when the tuttle moves beyond the right (top) of the space to
    reappear on the left (bottom) of the space. Implement one, or
    all, of these alternative behaviours.</p>
