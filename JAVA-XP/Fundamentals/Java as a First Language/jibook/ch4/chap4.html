<h1 align="center">Chapter 4 Drawing and Image processing with
Java - <br>
the <font size="6" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font><font
size="6"> class</font></h1>

<p>This chapter will introduce a class which implements a style
of graphical output known as <i>turtle graphics</i>. In this
style of graphics it is imagined that a turtle, or other small
creature, is crawling across the surface of the screen and
sometimes leaving a trail as it goes. Instructions such as crawl
forward, or backwards, so many steps; turn right, or left, so
many degrees or pull your pen up, or down, can be given to the
turtle and result in the expected output being produced on the
screen. Due to a typing error during a project involving turtle
graphics several years ago these became known as <i>tuttle</i>
graphics to the author and the name has stayed.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter the <font size="2" face="Arial">Canvas</font>
class was extended to produce specialised interface components
and the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class
will be similarly produced in this chapter. To enable
sophisticated components to be produced Java's drawing facilities
will have to be understood in greater detail, and the
implementation of <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
graphics will more than satisfy this requirement. This will also
afford an opportunity for an introduction to the algorithmic
manipulation of images to be provided. As this book is only a
primer these introductions will necessarily only provide an
initial understanding and competence. The intention is that they
will be sufficient for more advanced discussions of these topics
to be approached, suggestions concerning suitable references are
made in Appendix A.</p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class is
also being developed at this stage so that various different
styles of user interfaces, which will be used to control the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>, can be introduced in
the chapters which follow. It may be that the details of Java's
graphical capabilities are found very complex when they are
considered for the first time. If this is the case then the
details can be glossed over and all that needs to be understood
for the chapters which follow are the <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>public</b></font>
features of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
class and how to use them.</p>
