<title> 6.1 The MenuBarTuttle interface </title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1 align="center">6.1 The <font size="5" face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font><font
size="6"> interface</font></h1>

<p>The appearance of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font>
interface, under Windows '95, is illustrated in Figure 6.1. It
shows the main menu bar at the top of the interface, the feedback
panel at the bottom and the tuttle in the middle.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 6.1</b> The <font face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font>
interface, (with the drawing area reduced in height).</p>

<p>The various <i>pull-down menus</i> attached to the <i>menu&nbsp;buttons</i>
on the <i>menu bar</i> at the top of the application are shown in
Figure 6.2.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 6.2</b> The </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font><font size="2">
interface menu structure.</font></p>

<p>The first pull-down menu, the <i>File</i> menu, has a single <font
size="2" face="Arial">MenuItem</font> labeled <i>Exit&#133;</i>
The three dots following the label on the button indicate that
when it is activated a <i>dialog</i> will be posted, which the
user will interact with to complete the operation. In this
example it is a <i>yes</i>/&nbsp;<i>no</i> confirmation of the
request to exit the application, as will be described below. </p>

<p>The second pull-down menu, the <i>Move</i> menu, has two items
labeled <i>Forward</i> and <i>Backward</i>. Each item is followed
by a right facing triangle which indicates that, when activated,
the item will post a second, cascading, menu. Both of these <i>cascading
menus</i> are shown in Figure 6.2 and each consists of three
items allowing the <i>tuttle</i> to be moved by 5, 10 or 25
steps. The third pull-down menu, the <i>Turn</i> menu, is
essentially identical in its structure having two items labeled <i>Turn&nbsp;Right</i>
and <i>Turn&nbsp;Left</i>, each of which leads to a cascading
menu with options to turn by 5, 15 or 45 degrees.</p>

<p>The fourth pull-down menu, the <i>Colors</i> menu, also has
two cascading menus controlled by items labeled <i>Foreground</i>
and <i>Background</i>. Each cascading menu contains six <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>CheckboxMenuItems</i></font> behaving as
if they were radio buttons allowing only one item to be selected
at a time, the currently selected item indicated by a preceding
tick. The menus in Figure 6.2 indicate that the current
foreground color is <i>Blue</i> and the background is <i>Yellow</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Screen</i> menu commences with three simple items which
cause the screen to be cleared without moving the <i>tuttle</i>,
move the <i>tuttle</i> to the center of its area and for both a
re-centering of the <i>tuttle</i> and clearing of the screen to
be performed. The last option of this part of the menu is
separated from the previous two by use of a <i>separator</i>. The
<i>Screen</i> menu is completed, following another separator, by
two check box items allowing the state of the <i>tuttle</i>'s pen
to be controlled. The final menu, the <i>Help</i> menu, offers
access to two dialogs labeled <i>Version&#133;</i> and <i>Help&#133;</i></p>

<p>Thus the complete menu system contains five main menu buttons
and associated pull-down menus, six cascading menus, three dialog
panels, eighteen menu items which will have an effect upon the
tuttle or its interface and fourteen check box items. In addition
there are three dialog panels the: <i>exit</i>, <i>help</i> and <i>version</i>
dialogs which are shown when the appropriate menu item is
activated by the user. </p>

<p>In this part of the chapter only a selection of these elements
will be described in detail, the remaining items are essentially
identical and details of how to obtain the complete source code
is located at the start of appendix B.</p>
