<h1 align="center">6.2 The <font size="5" face="Arial">MenuComponent</font><font
size="6"> hierarchy</font></h1>

<p>The facilities for the construction of menus are supplied by
the Java AWT in a class hierarchy based upon the <font size="2"
face="Arial">MenuComponent</font> class, which is a sibling class
of the <font size="2" face="Arial">Component</font> class whose
hierarchy has been used so far. The <font size="2" face="Arial">MenuComponent</font>
class hierarchy diagram was given Figure 2.16 and is repeated in
Figure 6.3 for convenience, again the <font size="2" face="Arial">Object</font>
class is not part of the AWT but has been included to show the
relationship between the AWT classes and it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 6.3</b> The Java AWT <font
face="Arial">MenuComponent</font> class hierarchy.</p>

<p>The base of the class is the abstract <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>MenuComponent</i></font> class which, like the <font
size="2" face="Arial">Component</font> class, provides a
collection of resources which are common to all other <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>MenuComponent</i></font>s. Its most
important resources are given in Table 6.1.</p>

<p align="center"><b><img src="table61.gif" width="603"

<p align="center"><b>Table 6.1</b> Major resources of the <font
face="Arial">MenuComponent</font> class. </p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial">MenuBar</font> class supplies
a menu bar upon which the main menu buttons, and their pull-down
menus, can be attached. Its major resources are given in Table
6.2.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b><img src="table62.gif"

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>Table 6.2</b> Major resources
of the </font><font size="3" face="Arial">MenuBar</font><font
size="3"> class. </font></p>

<p>A <font size="2" face="Arial">MenuBar</font>, once
constructed, can only be added to a <font size="2" face="Arial">Frame</font>
instance using the <font size="2" face="Arial">Frame</font>'s <font
size="2" face="Arial">setMenuBar()</font> method. As mentioned in
Chapter 3 a <font size="2" face="Arial">Frame</font> is not an
extension of, or a parent class of, the <font size="2"
face="Arial">Applet</font> class and provides an independent top
level window on the desktop. This means that application level
main menus cannot be presented within a <font size="2"
face="Arial">Applet</font> window inside a browser, but only in a
separate top level window on the desktop. </p>

<p>The reason for this restriction is that the provision of a top
level menu within an applet might result in two top level menus
being presented to the user. For example: when the applet is
executed within a browser, the browser would supply a top level
menu and if the applet were to provide a second then this would
undoubtedly be confusing to a user. Within the Apple, NextStep
and OpenStep environments this would be particularly confusing as
these environments support only a single top level menu, visible
at the top of the screen, and change the options on the menu as
the user moves focus from application to application. By
insisting that a top level menu in a Java artifact must be
associated with a Frame instance this problem is avoided. </p>

<p>If a <font size="2" face="Arial">MenuBar</font> contains a <i>help</i>
menu button, as nomiated by the use of the <font size="2"
face="Arial">setHelpMenu()</font> method, it is always presented
as the right most button on the menu bar. All other buttons are
presented in a left right location determined by the sequence
they were added to the menu bar. </p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial">MenuItem</font> class provides
the entries which can appear on the pull down and cascading menu
panes; its major resources are presented in Table 6.3.</p>

<p align="center"><b><img src="table63.gif" width="601"

<p align="center"><b>Table 6.3</b> Major resources of the <font
face="Arial">MenuItem</font> class. </p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial">Menu</font> class provides the
<i>menu&nbsp; panes</i> which provide the pull-down and cascading
menus and the buttons which they are connected to. Its major
resources are given in Table 6.4.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="table64.gif" width="608" height="394"></p>

<p align="center"><b>Table 6.4</b> Major resources of the <font
face="Arial">Menu </font>class. </p>

<p>A <font size="2" face="Arial">TearOff</font> menu can be
detached from the top level menu and remains available to the
user in a separate window, allowing them to make extensive use of
it without having to continually re-post it from the top level
menu. Finally the <font size="2" face="Arial">CheckboxMenuItem</font>
class is used to supply check box items on a menu, its major
resources are given in Table 6.5.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Table 6.5</b> Major resources of the <font

<p>There is no support in the AWT for a set of <font size="2"
face="Arial">CheckboxMenuItem</font>s to behave as a set of radio
buttons, allowing only one of them to be checked at a time. If
this behavior is required then it has to be supplied by the
developer, as will be illustrated below. The use of <i>menu
accelerators</i>, supplied by the <font size="2" face="Arial">MenuShortcut</font>
class, will also be described below. </p>
