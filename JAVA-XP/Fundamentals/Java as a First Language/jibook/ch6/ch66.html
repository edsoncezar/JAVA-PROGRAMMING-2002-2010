<p>The remainder of this chapter will introduce the three dialogs
shown at the bottom of the context diagram in Figure 6.4. The
presentation of a dialog to a user is an essential and valuable
part of a wide variety of user interfaces. The pattern of
construction and use which will be established in this part of
the chapter can be used a template upon which more advanced
dialogs can be constructed. All three of these classes providing
the dialogs extend the <font size="2" face="Arial">Dialog</font>
class whose major resources, including those inherited from the <font
size="2" face="Arial">Window</font> class, are given in Table
6.6.</p>

including those inherited from <font face="Arial">Window</font> .</p>

<p>A <font size="2" face="Arial">Dialog</font> <b><i>is&nbsp;a</i></b>n
extension of the <font size="2" face="Arial">Window</font> class
which in turn <b><i>is&nbsp;a</i></b>n extension of the <font
size="2" face="Arial">Container </font>class and hence can
control the layout of its instance children. A <font size="2"
face="Arial">Dialog</font> is constructed in an invisible state
and should be <font size="2" face="Arial">pack</font>ed after its
instance children are added, before it is shown using <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>setVisible() </i></font>with the
argument <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>true</b></font>. Once
visible its <i>stacking</i> relationship with other windows can
be controlled with <font size="2" face="Arial">toFront()</font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial">toBack()</font>. When it is no
longer required it can be hidden by using the <font size="2"
face="Arial">Component</font> <font size="2" face="Arial">setVisible()</font>
method with the argument <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>false</b></font>.
</p>

<p>A <i>modal</i> dialog will prevent the user from having any
other interactions with the application until it has been
attended to and dismissed, and will always remain in front of any
other windows. In contrast a <i>non-modal</i> dialog does not
prevent the user from interacting with the application whilst it
is posted and can be hidden behind other windows. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Design Advice</i></b> </p>
    <p>Modal dialogs should be only used when the functionality
    of the application depends on the modality. In general
    non-modal dialogs should be favoured. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The user can iconify, maximize, minimize and close the window
using the window controls supplied by the peer environment and
these will cause appropriate <font size="2" face="Arial">WindowEvent</font>s
to be<font size="1"> </font>generated. The user can only resize a
window, using the window controls, if its <font size="2"
face="Arial">resizable</font> attribute has been set also
generating a <font size="2" face="Arial">WindowEvent</font>. All <font
size="2" face="Arial">WindowEvent</font>s can be intercepted by
the registered <font size="2" face="Arial">windowListener</font>
and the requested methods confirmed or denied. Examples of
handling <font size="2" face="Arial">WindowEvent</font>s will be
given below. </p>

<p>There are two design approaches to using <font size="2"
face="Arial">Dialog</font>s, and other sub-windows, within an
application. The first approach is to create all the windows in
an invisible state as the application initializes itself. These
windows are then shown in response to the user's actions and are
subsequently hidden when they are no longer required. The
alternative approach is not to create any windows upon
initialization but to create them each time they are required and
destroy them when they are no longer required. </p>

<p>The first approach causes the time an application takes to
initialize itself to increase but allows a window to be posted
very quickly. The second approach allows an application to appear
faster but there may be a delay when a sub-window is requested by
the user. In practice a combination of these approaches can be
used with windows which are frequently required, or whose
contents do not change, being created as the application is
initialized. Those windows which are infrequently required, or
those whose contents change each time they are shown, being
created upon demand. Both of these techniques will be used in the
remainder of this book. </p>

<p>A more advanced approach to this problem may involve the
construction and presentation of the main window to the user as
quickly as possible on the artifact's main thread. At the same
time the dialogs can be constructed on separate threads which
have a lower level of priority. The user can then commence work
with the application as quickly as possible, with Java preparing
the dialogs when it is not busy attending to the user. Details of
this technique are outside the scope of this book.</p>
