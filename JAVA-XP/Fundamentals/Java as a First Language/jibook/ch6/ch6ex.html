<h1 align="center">Exercises for Chapter 6</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>6.1</strong> Extend the the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font> interface to add
    controls for the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>GeometricTuttle</i></font>
    class from Exercise 4.4.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.2</strong> Redesign, and subsequently
    re-implement, the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font>'s
    <i>Move</i> and <i>Turn</i> menus so that the user can move
    or turn the tuttle an arbitrary number of units. This should
    be accomplished, for example when moving the tuttle forwards,
    by interposing a cascading menu which offers two further
    cascading menus labelled <i>tens</i> and <i>units</i>. The <i>tens</i>
    menu should offer items which move the tuttle <i>10</i>, <i>20</i>,
    <i>30</i> steps etc. and the <i>units</i> menu items to move
    it <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i> steps etc. So if the user
    wanted to move the tuttle 47 steps they could activate the <i>Move/&nbsp;Forwards/&nbsp;tens/&nbsp;40</i>
    item followed by the <i>Move/&nbsp;Forwards/&nbsp;units/&nbsp;7</i>
    item. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.3</strong> Redesign, and subsequently
    re-implement, the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>MenuBarTuttle</i></font>'s
    <i>Move</i> and <i>Turn</i> menus so that the user can move
    or turn the tuttle an arbitrary number of units. This should
    be accomplished, for example when moving the tuttle, by a
    single item on the <i>Move</i> menu labelled <i>Steps&nbsp;&#133;</i>
    Activating this item should post a dialog which contains a
    feedback <font size="2" face="Arial">Label</font>, a
    horizontal <font size="2" face="Arial">ScrollBar</font> and <i>Forward</i>,
    <i>Backward</i> and <i>Dismiss</i> buttons. So if the user
    wanted to move the tuttle 47 steps they could post the
    dialog, set the slider to 47, confirming this in the feedback
    Label, and then pressing the <i>Forward </i>button.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.4</strong> How could you find out which of the
    interfaces from 6.2 and 6.3 was favoured by the users?<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.5</strong> Install suitable accelerators into
    the menu structure and attempt to determine by investigation
    if their presence assists users. Does the experience level of
    the user make the more likeley to use accelerators?<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.6</strong> Provide an <i>Exit</i> button and a <i>Help</i>
    <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ImageButton</i></font> for the
    <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>SemiDirectInterface</i></font>
    from Chapter 5 and cause them to post the appropriate dialog
    when they are pressed.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.7 </strong>Design and implement the alternative
    help system as described in the chapter.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>6.8</strong> Re-implement the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>ExitDialog</i></font> class so that an
    instance of the class is created each time the user activates
    the <i>File</i> menu <i>Exit&nbsp;&#133;</i> item and is
    destroyed each time the user dismisses it. Attempt to
    determine if there are any significant differences in the
    time it takes for the application to initialise itself and in
    the time it takes for the dialog to be posted between this
    implementation and the implementation as described in the
    chapter. <br>
