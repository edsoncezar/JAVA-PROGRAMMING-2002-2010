<p>The second interface which will be presented is a standard <i>application
level menu</i> style. This style consists of a sequence of <i>menu
buttons</i> mounted on a <i>menu bar</i> at the top of the
application. Each menu button, when activated, causes a <i>pull-down</i>
menu of items to be presented. An item may be an <i>action button</i>
which causes an action to occur, a <i>menu button</i> which
causes a <i>cascading menu</i> to appear or a <i>dialog button </i>which
causes a <i>dialog panel</i> to appear. </p>

<p>This style of interface has become ubiquitous for a very large
number of applications and hence has a major advantage that,
because of this widespread use, users will feel very familiar
with it. However it is probably the least suitable style of
interface for the control of a <i>tuttle</i>, it is being
introduced so that the techniques for the construction of this
style of interface can be used where an application level menu
style of interface is more suitable.</p>

<p>This chapter will also introduce the techniques and mechanisms
which can be used to deploy a <i>dialog panel</i> within an
application. This is a temporary window which appears on top of
the main application window and informs the user of some
occurrence or error or obtains some information from the user.
Although dialog panels are being introduced in the context of
application level menus they can also be used with other styles
of user interface.</p>
