<h1 align="center"><b>2.1 The Abstract Windows Toolkit</b></h1>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
interface from the previous chapter made use of the <font
size="2" face="Arial">Button</font> and <font size="2"
face="Arial">Label</font> components from the Java <b><i>A</i></b>bstract&nbsp;<b><i>W</i></b>indowing&nbsp;<b><i>T</i></b>oolkit
(<i>AWT</i>) package. This toolkit supplies a number of classes,
each providing an interface component which can be combined with
other components to build a complete
Graphical&nbsp;User&nbsp;Interface. To produce interfaces which
are more complex than those introduced in Chapter&nbsp;1 the
classes which comprise the AWT have to be understood and used.
This chapter will present each of the major classes from the
toolkit in turn and indicate how it could be used within a GUI.
This will necessarily be only an initial introduction to each of
the classes and more details of most of the classes will be given
in the following chapters. </p>

<p>The AWT is named as an <i>abstract</i> toolkit as it provides
only the essential components and functionality which are common
to all major windowing systems. For example the Microsoft Windows
environment, the Apple Macintosh environment and the various
X&nbsp;Windows environments all supply a push&nbsp;button
component. However the physical appearance of the button, precise
behaviour and API differ significantly between all three
environments. Java <i>abstracts</i> the essential behaviour of a
push button and provides an API which is presented to the
developer in the AWT. When an instance of the Java <font size="2"
face="Arial">Button</font> class is realised, the actual button
which is presented to the user is obtained from the native
environment</p>

<p>Figure 2.1 presents the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter
</i></font>interface from Chapter 1 when it is realised in each
of the three environments listed above. In each case exactly the
same Java source code is used and the user can interact with the
application in exactly the same way. However the precise physical
appearance is determined by the native windowing environment. All
of the components of each of the implementations the three <font
size="2" face="Arial">Buttons</font>, the <font size="2"
face="Arial">Label</font> and the <font size="2" face="Arial">Panel</font>s
which they are mounted upon, are supplied by <i>peer&nbsp;components</i>
from the native windowing toolkit. </p>
