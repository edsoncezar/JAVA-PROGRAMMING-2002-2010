<h1 align="center">Chapter 2 - A whistle stop tour of the
Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT)<br>
</h1>

<p>In this chapter a selection of the simpler user interface
components supplied by the Java AWT will be presented. Each will
have its methods and other resources described and either a
trivial <font face="Arial"><i>init()</i></font> method to
illustrate its typical use and appearance, or a demonstration
applet will be given. The full implementation of GUIs, as
application, presentation and translation classes, will not be
presented in the interests of manageable simplicity. During this
tour many of the ideas from the previous chapter, in particular
layout managers, will be re-presented, consolidated and
augmented. </p>

<p>As well as providing an introduction to using existing Java
components an introduction to extending them will also be
presented. It is often the case that a particular requirement is
not satisfied by any existing component and in these
circumstances a specialized component has to be produced. In
keeping with Java's Object Oriented philosophy this is best
accomplished by the extension of an existing component rather
than the construction of a component from scratch. </p>

<p>The chapter ends with a number of practical exercises
concerned with the design and construction of applets. These
exercises should be conscientiously attempted as the only sure
way to assimilate the contents of the first two introductory
chapters is to struggle with the software. </p>
