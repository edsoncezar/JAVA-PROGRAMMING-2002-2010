<title> 5.2 The SemiDirectTuttle interface </title>

<p>The semi-direct interface uses a collection of <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>TuttleButtons</i></font> to allow the user to
control a <i>tuttle</i> instance. The appearance of the interface
is illustrated in Figure 5.4.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b><img src="fig54.gif"

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 5.4</b> The </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>SemiDirectTuttle</i></font><font
size="2"> interface, (with the drawing area reduced in height).</font></p>

<p>There is a total of 21 <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TuttleButton</i></font>s
in the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttleControl</i> Panel</font>
at the bottom of the interface and grouping has been used to help
indicate to the user the different functions which the buttons
control. The collection of six buttons at the top left of the <font
size="2" face="Arial">Panel</font> is used to control the
tuttle's drawing colour; the colour of the tuttle in each button
indicating the colour which the tuttle will draw with. The
collection of six buttons below it control the background colour
of the drawing area, with the button's background illustrating
the colour which it will be cleared to. Apart from the black and
white buttons, at the right of each collection, each button uses
a border colour appropriate to its effect.</p>

<p>The collection of buttons at the top right of the panel
control the screen functions and indicate, from left to right,
clearing the drawing without resetting the tuttle, resetting the
tuttle without clearing the drawing and both clearing and
resetting the tuttle. The two buttons below this collection
indicate pen up and pen down. The collection of four larger
buttons in the center of the panel control the movement of the
tuttle. The two buttons in the center indicate moving forwards
(up) and backwards (down) and the remaining two turning to the
left and turning to the right. </p>

<p>As well as using the spatial position of the buttons to
indicate their effect, both by grouping related effects together
and, in the case of the movement buttons, their relative
locations, the appearance of the buttons is used to communicate
their effect. For the colour buttons this is done by using the
appropriate colour for their foreground and background, all the
other buttons are presented with grey scale images. The use of
left facing tuttles for the foreground and right facing tuttles
for the background buttons is intended to reinforce this
distinction.</p>

<p>The image used on each button, hopefully, gives an iconic
representation of the button's effect. For example the dotted
line below the pen up button indicates that as the tuttle moves
it will leave no trace, particularly in comparison with the other
button in the group which has a solid line below the tuttle. The
icons used on the buttons should ideally be designed, and
produced, by a graphic artist who is trained to communicate ideas
by images in an aesthetically pleasing manner, (unlike these
buttons which were designed by a complete amateur, the author!). </p>

<p>However there are very few images which clearly and
unambiguously communicate the essence of an object or an action
in a culturally independent manner, and it is likely that all of
these have already been discovered. Accordingly, even though
techniques can be used to improve the communicative impact of
icons, it should not be assumed that the users will always be
able to derive the meaning of an icon from its appearance and a
help system, or training, should be available for the users of an
iconic interface.</p>
