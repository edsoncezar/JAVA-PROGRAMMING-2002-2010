<h1 align="center">Chapter 5 Semi-direct user interfaces</h1>

<p>In this, and the following two chapters, four possible styles
of user interface will be developed for the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class as developed in the
previous chapter. The interface presented in this chapter is a <i>semi-direct</i>
style of interface, where the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
will be controlled from a collection of buttons below its drawing
area which display iconic representations of the action which
they control. This interface style is described as semi-direct as
<i>direct</i> manipulation would allow the user to control the
tuttle by selecting and manipulating it with the pointer and the
mouse. For example to move the tuttle it might be selected and
dragged or to turn it and a double mouse click may cause a <i>pop-up</i>
menu to appear. </p>

<p>The semi-direct interface will require buttons capable of
displaying icons, but the 1.1 release of the AWT does not supply
a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Button</i></font> class which is
capable of displaying an image, only one which is capable of
displaying a text label. Consequently the first part of this
chapter will implement a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TuttleButton</i></font>
class which provides this facility. This will still be a valuable
exercise even if a subsequent release of the AWT does supply an <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ImageButton</i></font> class as it will
consolidate the understanding of supplying specialised
components, and the requirements of a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TuttleButton</i></font>
may differ significantly from any <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ImageButton</i></font>
class which might be supplied. </p>

<p>This interface, and those in the following chapters, may not
be the best style of interface for the control of a tuttle. They
are being introduced so that the considerations and techniques
for the construction of these interface styles can be used where
they are the more appropriate. When all four styles of interface
have been introduced the techniques which can be used to evaluate
an interface will be discussed. </p>
