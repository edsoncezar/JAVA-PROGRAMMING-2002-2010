<h1 align="center">Chapter 3 - Extending pre-supplied AWT
Components</h1>

<p>This chapter will illustrate the production of user interfaces
which require specialized components to be developed by extending
the pre-supplied Java components. Such specialized components are
developed by extending a standard <font size="2" face="Arial">Component</font>
from the AWT, most commonly the <font size="2" face="Arial">Canvas</font>
class. </p>

<p>The first artifact which will be developed is a <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>StikNote</i></font> application which provides
the functionality of the pads of small pieces of paper each of
which has a strip of adhesive on its reverse. They are used by
writing a short note on the top of the pad, then tearing it off
and sticking it on a convenient surface. When the note has served
its purpose it can be taken down and thrown away. </p>

<p>The second artifact is a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>DateEntry</i></font>
component which is intended to be used as a constituent part of a
more complex interface. It allows the user to enter a calendar
date in an unambiguous and error free manner. </p>
