<h1 align="center"><b>Exercises for Chapter 3</b></h1>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>3.1</strong> Color can be used in the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>StikNote</i></font> application to
    indicate the relative importance of the notes. For example a
    red note to indicate an important message, yellow for routine
    and green for non-important. Redesign and re-implement the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>StikNote</i></font> application to
    provide three buttons marked <i>Urgent</i>, <i>Routine</i>
    and <i>Trivial</i> at the bottom which will produce a note of
    the required color. </p>
    <p><strong>3.2 </strong>Following on from exercise 3.1,
    different fonts can also be used. Use the AWT documentation
    to find out what fonts are available and use different fonts
    for different priorities of message. </p>
    <p><strong>3.3</strong> Extract the first word, or two, from
    the contents of a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>StikNote</i></font>
    and use it as the window's title, rather than have them all
    titled &quot;<i>Stik&nbsp;Note&quot;</i>. </p>
    <p><strong>3.4</strong> Test the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>DatePanel</i></font>.
    Produce a formal black box test plan and apply it to the
    component in order to increase your confidence that it is
    working correctly. </p>
    <p><strong>3.5 </strong>Place the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>DatePanel</i></font>
    within a realistic application, for example one which asks
    you to indicate your date of birth and then informs you how
    many days you have lived. </p>
    <p><strong>3.6</strong> Re-design and re-implement the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>DatePanel</i></font> so that it has
    a minimum date below which a date cannot be selected. For
    example an airline booking system should only allow a return
    flight to be booked on a date later than, or equal to, the
    date of the outward flight. Demonstrate the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>MinimumDatePanel</i></font> in a suitable
    harness. </p>
    <p><strong>3.7</strong> The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>DatePanel</i></font>
    in this chapter takes up a large amount of screen space. This
    design attempts to provide the same functionality in a much
    smaller space. Pressing the appropriate <b>»</b> button will
    increase its field and pressing « will decrease it. Design,
    implement and demonstrate this design. How would you find out
    which was favored by users?</p>
    <p><strong>3.8</strong> Implement a <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>MinimalClockPanel</i></font> based on the
    design idea from Exercise 3.7, allowing a time to be
    specified some time ahead of the current time. Include an
    instance of it on the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>StikNote</i></font>
    interface allowing an alarm time to be set on the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>NoteWindow</i></font>. When the time
    has arrived the note should indicate this to the user by
    reversing its colors every half second.</p>
    <p><strong>3.9</strong> Re-implement the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>MessageCanvas</i></font> class so that it has
    an attribute and methods to control the layout, <font
    size="2">LEFT, RIGHT</font> or <font size="2">JUSTIFIED</font>
    of the message. </p>
    <p><strong>3.10</strong> Adapt the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>DatePanelDemonstration</i></font> class so
    that it registers two object listeners with the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>DatePanel</i></font> contained
    within it, then show that both are called when the date is
    changed.</p>
    <p><strong>3.11</strong> There is a bug in the positioning of
    the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>NoteWindow</i></font>
    instances. If the main <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>StikNote</i></font>
    window is in the top left of the desktop, the instance's top
    left corner may be positioned somewhere beyond the top left
    corner. Demonstrate and correct this bug.</p>
    <p><strong>3.12 </strong>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>MessageCanvas</i></font>
    class is not fully secure or compliant with the pre-declared
    AWT components. For example it inherits the <font size="2"
    face="Arial">setFont()</font> method from the <font size="2"
    face="Arial">Component</font> class which should result in
    its minimum and preferred sizes changing. Make a list of all
    the methods which it inherits and decide which need to be
    overridden in order to make it fully compliant.</p>
