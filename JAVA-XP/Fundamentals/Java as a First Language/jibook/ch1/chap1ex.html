<blockquote>
    <p><strong>1.1</strong> Redesign the final STD so that
    pressing the <i>increment</i> button when the counter is
    displaying its maximum value will cause it to display its
    minimum value and likewise pressing the <i>decrement</i>
    button at the minimum value will result in the maximum. Hint:
    what will this change do to the number of states?</p>
    <p><strong>1.2</strong> Implement the design from exercise
    1.1.</p>
    <p><strong>1.3</strong> How can the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font> applet, as developed
    in the chapter, be shown to be correct? Hint: you do not want
    to have to press the <i>increment</i> button one thousand
    times.</p>
    <p><strong>1.4 </strong>How could you determine which of the
    three possible implementations: that presented in the
    chapter, that developed in Exercise 1.3 and that suggested in
    Figure 1.4, would present the least number of usability
    problems to a user? </p>
    <p><strong>1.5</strong> A <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>VehicleCounter</i></font>
    application is required. In this application two click
    counter instances are required, one to be used to count cars
    as they pass the counter and one to count all other vehicles.
    A third numeric display is to provided which will show the
    total of the two counters. Produce a state transition diagram
    for this application and implement the resulting design.</p>
    <p><strong>1.6 </strong>Design and implement an application
    which will either display the date or the time. The
    application class should provide <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>dateIs()</i></font>
    and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>timeIs()</i></font>
    methods and this can be simulated for this exercise by
    returning constant strings. The interface should present a
    display area at the top and two buttons, a date button and a
    time button, at the bottom. The date button should be
    insensitive when the time is displayed and vice versa;
    pressing a button should have the expected effect. </p>
