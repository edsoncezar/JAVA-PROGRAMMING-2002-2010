<h1 align="center">Chapter 1 An introduction to Java and STD
design</h1>

<p>This book contains an introduction to the systematic
development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) using the Java
environment. It does not attempt to introduce the Java language
and it is assumed that the reader has some familiarity with
Object Oriented Development (OOD) and its practical expression in
Java. Suitable resources to assist with obtaining this knowledge
are given in Appendix A. However, a brief explanation of some
aspects of Java will be presented where appropriate, particularly
where the aspect differs significantly from C++.</p>

<p>The Java Development Kit (<i>JDK</i>), also known as the Java
environment, consists of a Java compiler producing Java bytecode
which can be interpreted by a run time engine, for example Sun's <i>appletviewer</i>,
to run Java programs. However the substantive part of the
environment consists of the extensive collection of <font
size="2" face="Arial"><b>package</b></font>s, <font size="2"
face="Arial"><b>class</b></font>es and <font size="2"
face="Arial"><b>interface</b></font>s collectively known as the
Java Application Programmer Interface (<i>API</i>). The most
important part of the API, so far as this book is concerned, is
the Abstract Windowing Toolkit (<i>AWT</i>) containing the user
interface <i>components</i> from which GUIs are constructed. </p>

<p>In this book whenever a Java reserved word is used this <font
size="2" face="Arial"><b>bold alternative</b></font> font will be
used. The <font size="2" face="Arial">alternative font</font> by
itself will indicate the use of an API resource and an <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>italic alternative font</i></font> for
developer supplied Java resources. The <i>italicised normal font</i>
will be used when a new technical term is introduced for the
first time or when its meaning is significantly extended. This <i>italicised
font</i> is also used when a design fragment is referred to which
cannot be identified by a corresponding Java term. A similar
convention is used in program listings where <font size="2"
face="Courier New"><b><tt>this bold font</tt></b></font>
indicates Java's reserved words, <font size="2"
face="Courier New"><i><tt>italic font</tt></i></font> indicates
developer supplied resources and <tt>normal font</tt> Java API
resources. </p>

<p>This first, introductory, chapter introduces the systematic
development of Graphical User Interfaces which a user can
interact with in order to control an underlying application. This
is done by the exposition of the development process involved in
the construction of a relatively trivial application. The
considerations, stages and procedures involved may seem to be far
too complex for this application's requirements. However the
processes presented in this chapter are essential for the
successful development of more complex GUIs and it is only by
practising and perfecting these skills on relatively simple
applications that they can be successfully applied to more
complex ones. </p>
