<p>This book is concerned with the development of user
interfaces, not with the production of the applications to which
the interfaces provide access. One of the most basic software
engineering principles is to divide a specification into separate
concerns and to implement each concern as an independent program
module. For specifications which include a graphical user
interface this would imply that the application and its interface
should be developed independently. This design principle has the
consequence of allowing the application modules to be reused with
differing styles of user interface, or even used in embedded
applications which do not have any direct interaction with a
user. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Design Advice</i></b> </p>
    <p>Keep the application and interface functionality clearly
    separated in the design and consequently in the
    implementation. </p>

<p>In order to concentrate on user interfaces the detailed design
and implementation of the application level classes will not be
presented in the text. Appendix B includes the source code of
some of the application classes which are used throughout the
book. </p>

<p>For this initial example an application known as a <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font> will be
developed. It is based upon the small mechanical devices which
are sometimes used to count people as they enter a room. The
device consists of a counting button and a numeric display; every
time the counting button is pressed the value on the display is
incremented by one. A second button is used to reset the display
to zero. </p>

<p>The application level object which implements this requirement
has had its functionality extended beyond this minimal
requirement for reasons which will be described below. The class
diagram of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
class is shown in Figure 1.1.</p>

application class diagram.</p>

<p>A class diagram illustrates the resources which instances of a
class will supply, details of the class diagram notation used in
this book are given in Appendix C. This diagram indicates, at the
top, that the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
class is an extension of the pre-supplied Java <font size="2"
face="Arial">Object</font> class. Each instance of the class
contains three encapsulated <i>data attributes</i>: <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>minimumCount</i></font>, <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>maximumCount</i></font><i> </i>and <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font>. As encapsulated
resources they are totally <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>private</b></font>
to the class and cannot be seen or referenced from anything
outside the class</p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>minimumCount</i></font> and
<font size="2" face="Arial"><i>maximumCount</i></font><i> </i>attributes
delineate the range of values which the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font> will count through and
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font>
attribute is the current number of occurrences counted. The class
also contains two <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>private</b></font>
<i>class&nbsp;wide</i> constant attributes for the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>DEFAULT_MINIMUM</i></font> and <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>DEFAULT_MAXIMUM</i></font> of the range; in this
implementation they are set to 0 and 999. </p>

<p>Resources shown crossing the right side of a class diagram are
fully <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>public</b></font> and so are
totally visible outside the class. The first three of these
resources have the same name as the class and so are <i>constructors</i>.
The purpose of a constructor is to create an instance of the
class and place it into a well defined initial state.</p>

<p>The first constructor has two arguments, shown as in coming
data flows labeled <i>minimum</i> and <i>maximum</i>, which allow
the range of values to be counted between to be fully specified.
The second constructor requires only the <i>maximum</i> value to
be specified using <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>DEFAULT_MINIMUM</i></font>
for the <i>minimum</i> value. The last constructor uses the
defaults for the <i>minimum</i> and <i>maximum</i> values. </p>

<p>The next two <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>public</b></font>
resources are <i>inquiry methods</i> which can be used to
determine the state of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>private</b></font>
resources. These two methods both return a <font size="2"
face="Arial">Boolean</font> value, as shown on the outgoing data
flow. The first of these methods is called <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>isAtMaximum()</i></font> and will return <font
size="2" face="Arial"><b>true</b></font> if the value of <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font> is equal to the
value of <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>maximumCount</i></font>,
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><b>false</b></font> otherwise.
The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>isAtMinimum()</i></font>
method is similar but compares the values of <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font> and <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>minimumCount</i></font>, </p>

<p>The following three methods embody the essential functionality
of the click counter. The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>count()</i></font>
method will increment the value of <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font>
unless it is at its maximum value in which case the value will
not be changed. The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>unCount()</i></font>
method will likewise decrement the value of <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font> unless it is at its
minimum. The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset()</i></font>
method will reset the value of <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>clicksCounted</i></font>
to the minimum value as established upon construction. The final
two resources are inquiry methods which return the value of the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font> as an <font
size="2" face="Arial"><b>int</b></font>eger and as a three
character <font size="2" face="Arial">String</font> formatted
with leading zeros. </p>

<p>One difference between the functionality of the mechanical
click counter and of this software model concerns its behaviour
at the maximum limit of its range. If a mechanical click counter
is at the maximum of its range, a press of its counting button
will cause its value to change to the minimum of the range. This
software model will not do this and will not even give any
warning if the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>count()</i></font>
method is called when it is at its maximum. The consequences of
this consideration will be explored below. </p>
