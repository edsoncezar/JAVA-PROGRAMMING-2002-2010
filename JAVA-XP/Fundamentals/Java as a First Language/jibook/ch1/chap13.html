<h1 align="center">1.3 Application, presentation and <br>
translation implementation </h1>

<p>The essence of almost all software engineering approaches to
implementation involve the partition of the specification into
separate areas of concern and their subsequent implementation as
distinct modules. It has already been emphasized that the
application functionality should be implemented separately from
the interface, what is not so obvious is that the interface
module should itself be divided into two areas of concern. This
is illustrated in Figure 1.6 which presents an application and
its interface as if it were an iceberg. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.6</b> The user
interface as an iceberg.</font></p>

<p>As with an iceberg floating in the sea, the visible part of a
graphical user interface represents only a small part of the
interface as a whole. The majority of the interface, which cannot
be seen, implements the behavior of the interface and is
considerably more complex than that part which can be seen.
Accordingly the interface should be implemented in two parts: the
<i>presentation</i> aspects which will be seen by the user and
the <i>translation</i> aspects which supply the behavior. The
iceberg diagram also indicates the <i>application</i> part of the
artifact which may be a relatively small component, if the
iceberg if floating in shallow water; or may be immensely larger
than the other two parts, if the iceberg is floating in deep
water. </p>

    <p><b><i>Design Advice</i></b> </p>
    <p>Implement the graphical user interface as a <i>presentation</i>
    module, containing the visible parts, and a <i>translation</i>
    module, containing the behavior of the interface. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before presenting the design and implementation of the
interface for the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
an overview of the ways in which <i>events</i> are created and
transmitted in a Java artifact, and how this is used to implement
an interface's behavior, will be presented. The mechanism is
illustrated in Figure 1.7.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="fig17.gif" width="563" height="288"></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.7</b> Event
generation and consequences.</font></p>

<p>When the user interacts in some way with an interactive
component of the <i>presentation</i> module, for example pushing
a button, an <i>event</i> is generated by the AWT. The event is
then sent to the <i>translation</i> module, which has been
registered with the button as its <i>listener</i>. The
translation module then communicates with the <i>application</i>
module which performs the processing associated with the button
which was pressed. When the application module has completed its
processing the translation module calls methods in the <i>presentation</i>
module to change its appearance. The user thus has a visual
feedback of the consequences of their action, <i>closing</i> the
cycle.</p>

<p>Foe example: in the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
application the user might press the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>increment</i></font>
button whilst the interface is in its <i>minimal</i> state. This
will cause an event to be dispatched to the button's listener.
The listener object will call the counting object to count the
occurrence and then ask the counting object for its current
value. The listener object will then pass the current value to
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value display</i></font>, to
be shown to the user, and also set the sensitivities of the three
buttons to that appropriate for the <i>counting</i> state.</p>

<p>Each part of this design approach: <i>presentation</i>, <i>translation</i>
and <i>application</i> will be implemented as a distinct class.
An instance of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
class, which has already been presented, will provide the <i>application</i>
part. An instance of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterPresentation</i></font>
class, which will be described below, will provide the <i>presentation</i>
part and an instance of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterTranslation</i></font>
class, which will also be described below, will provide the <i>translation</i>
part. </p>

<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterTranslation</i></font>
class will extend the <font size="2" face="Arial">Applet</font>
class and so have the responsibility for initializing <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>theApplet</i></font>, constructing the
other two parts and starting the application. An <i>instance
diagram</i> for this application is given in Figure 1.8.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="fig18.gif" width="508" height="230"></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.8</b> The </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font><font size="2">
application - instance diagram. </font></p>

<p>An instance diagram is used to indicate which instances of
which classes, and the relationships which exist between them,
are required for the implementation of a particular artifact. The
instances are all <b><i>instances of</i></b> some class and the
parent-child relationships between the classes can also be shown
on the diagram. Full details of instance diagram notation can be
found in Appendix C.</p>

<p>In this diagram the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>theApplet</i></font>
is an instance of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterTranslation</i></font>
class which itself <b><i>is&nbsp;a</i></b>n extension of the AWT <font
size="2" face="Arial">Applet</font> class. The <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterTranslation</i></font> class is also
shown as implementing the Java <font size="2" face="Arial">ActionListener
<b>interface</b></font> in order for its' instances to be able to
<b><i>listen to</i></b> the events generated by the presentation
object. As an extended <font size="2" face="Arial">Applet</font>,
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterTranslation</i></font>
class inherits all the methods which are required for the
application to initialize itself, post itself onto the screen and
interact with the keyboard, mouse and screen.</p>

<p>The object which <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>theApplet</i></font>
is <b><i>listening to</i></b> is shown as an instance of the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounterPresentation</i></font>
class called <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>itsInterface</i></font>.
This instance contains the visible components of the interface,
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>valueDisplay</i></font> and
the three buttons. The instance diagram also shows that <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>theApplet</i></font> <b><i>uses</i></b>
an instance of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
class called <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>theCounter</i></font>
to actually do the counting. </p>
