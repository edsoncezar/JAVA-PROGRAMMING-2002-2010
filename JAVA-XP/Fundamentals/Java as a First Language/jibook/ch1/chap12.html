<p><i>State Transition Diagrams</i> (<i>STD</i>s) are used to
design the interaction which the user will have with the
application, and from this the behavior of the user interface.
Using the behavior of the mechanical click counter as a starting
point, the first version of a possible STD design for the
artifact is given in Figure 1.2.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="fig12.gif" width="590" height="294"></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.2</b> </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font><font size="2"> -
mechanical STD.</font></p>

<p>A STD consists of one or more states, shown as rectangular
boxes, connected by transactions, shown as arrows. The state
boxes can be also used to give an indication of the appearance of
the interface whilst it is in that state. A solid circle
indicates the start of a STD and is associated with an initial
transition leading to the initial state of the interface.
Transition arrows can have three labels associated with them, the
first label is the event which must occur for the transition to
be considered. The second label is the precondition which must be
true for the transition to be followed. The last label indicates
the consequences of taking the transition. </p>

<p>It is possible for the event label to be blank, in which case
the transition will be considered as soon as the interface
arrives in the state. The precondition will be continually tested
and the transition will be taken as soon as it evaluates true. It
is also possible for the precondition label to be blank, in which
case the transition will be taken as soon as the event occurs. It
is also possible for the consequences label to be blank in which
case only a state change occurs when the transition is followed. </p>

<p>There is no terminal transition in this design, which would be
shown as a transition leading to a bulls eyed circle.
Consequently this artifact will continue interacting with the
user until it is destroyed using operating system facilities.</p>

<p>A STD design provides an objective model of the state changes
which take place as the user interacts with the interface. As
such it describes the behavior of an application and of its
interface. Further details of STD notation can be found in
Appendix C.</p>

<p>The initial transition at the top of this design indicates
that the minimum value is always displayed when the click counter
user interface is first shown to the user. The main part of the
diagram indicates that this design has a single state to which
all transactions return. The significant parts of the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>clickCounter</i></font> interface are
illustrated within the state box. These are: the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>, shown as 999, the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>increment&nbsp;button</i></font>, shown
as &quot;<b>+</b>&quot; and the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset&nbsp;button</i></font>,
shown as &quot;<b>0</b>&quot;. Illustrating the contents of the<i>
</i><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display </i></font>as
999 indicates that it can display any three digits between 000
and 999.</p>

<p>The single state has three possible transitions all of which
lead back to itself. The simplest transition is shown on the
right of the diagram and is associated with a press of the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset</i></font>&nbsp;<font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>button</i></font>. The absence of a <i>precondition</i>
indicates that this transition will always be followed when the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset</i></font><i>&nbsp;</i><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>button</i></font> is pressed. The <i>consequence</i>
of this transition is to reset the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>
to its minimum value. One consideration here might be that the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset</i></font><i>&nbsp;</i><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>button</i></font> can be pressed whilst
the counter is at its minimum value causing it to be reset to its
minimum value. The alternative possibility of stating the <i>precondition</i>
that <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>
should not be at its minimum value for the transition to be
followed seems to add complexity for no particular benefit.</p>

<p>The other two transitions are associated with the pressing of
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>increment&nbsp;button</i></font>.
The transition at the top is taken when the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font> is not at its
maximum value and results in the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>
being incremented. The third transition, at the bottom, is
followed when the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>increment&nbsp;button</i></font>
is pressed and the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>
is at its maximum this transition results in the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font> being reset to its
minimum value. </p>

<p>This STD design describes the interface designer's cognitive
model of a simple mechanical click counter and can form the basis
of the design of the user interface which will be provided for
this application. However the provision of a software artifact
which models a real-world object need not be limited to the
behavior in the real-world. It is possible, and in most cases
desirable, for the software model to extend or augment real-world
behavior. </p>

<p>The first change from the mechanical click counter's
real-world appearance and behavior is to consumer the provision
of a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>decrement&nbsp;button</i></font>
(&nbsp;<b>-</b>&nbsp;) which can be used to un-count an
occurrence. This change will add functionality to the software
application which is not present in the physical artifact, in
order to make it more useful.</p>

<p>The second change is to modify the behavior of the counter so
that it cannot be incremented beyond the maximum of its range or
decrement below the minimum of its range. This change is somewhat
arbitrary and has been made in order to introduce some usability
considerations in the designs which follow. The first possible
STD design for this extended artifact is shown in Figure 1.3. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="fig13.gif" width="575" height="400"></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.3</b> Extended </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font><font size="2">,
first STD design.</font></p>

<p>In this design the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>increment</i></font>
and <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>decrement</i></font> buttons
have appropriate <i>preconditions</i> which prevent their
transitions being followed if the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>
is showing its maximum or minimum value respectively. One
consequence of this design refinement is that if the counter is
at its maximal state the user may press the increment button with
nothing apparently happening. If the user is not paying too close
attention to the application whilst this happens they may be
unaware that their clicks are not being counted. There is a
corresponding problem when the counter is at the minimum of its
range. One possible solution to this problem is shown in a second
design refinement given in Figure 1.4.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="fig14.gif" width="656" height="386"></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.4</b> Extended </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font><font size="2">,
second STD design.</font></p>

<p>This design alerts the user to the unavailability of the
counting functionality at the limits of its range by <i>posting</i>
a <i>modal</i> error <i>dialog</i> if the appropriate button is
pressed. These dialogs should contain an appropriate message
explaining to the user why the application is unable to perform
the action which they have requested. A <i>modal</i> dialog will
allow no interaction with the application which it is posted
from, until the dialog is attended to and <i>dismissed</i>. This
is accomplished, in this design, by pressing the <i>OK&nbsp;button</i>,
which causes the transition back to the counting state to be
followed. </p>

<p>The problem with this design is that it allows the user to
request an action which the application is unable to fulfill. On
the basis that prevention is better than cure the third, and
final, design refinement for the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>clickCounter</i></font>
application interface is given in Figure 1.5.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="fig15.gif" width="581" height="679"></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 1.5</b> Extended </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font><font size="2">,
third STD design.</font></p>

<p>This design has refined the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i></font>
into three distinct states: the <i>minimal&nbsp;state</i> when
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font>
is at its minimum, the <i>maximal&nbsp;state</i> when the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>value&nbsp;display</i></font> is at its
maximum and the <i>counting&nbsp;state</i> in all other cases.
When the application is launched the application is placed in the
<i>minimal&nbsp;state</i>; in this state the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>decrement</i></font> and <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>reset</i></font><i> </i>buttons are <i>desensitized</i>.
A desensitized button, or any other interface component, is
presented to the user in a grayed out state and is not responsive
to the users actions; i.e. for a button it cannot be pushed. </p>

<p>In the <i>minimal&nbsp;state</i> only the <i>increment</i>
button is sensitive and pressing this button causes the
transition to the <i>counting&nbsp;state</i> to be followed. The <i>consequence</i>
of this transition is to increment the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>valueDisplay</i></font> and to sensitize the <i>decrement</i>
and <i>reset </i>buttons. From the <i>counting&nbsp;state</i>
further presses of the <i>increment</i> button will increment the
<font size="2" face="Arial"><i>valueDisplay</i></font> until the <i>penultimate</i>
value is reached, at which point a further press will cause the
transition to the <i>maximal&nbsp;state</i>. In the <i>maximal&nbsp;state</i>
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>increment</i></font> button is
desensitized, preventing the user from attempting to increment
beyond its maximum value. </p>

<p>A similar pattern of events using the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>decrement</i></font> button from the <i>maximal&nbsp;state</i>,
through the <i>counting&nbsp;state</i>, back to the <i>minimal&nbsp;state</i>
can be followed on the STD. The <i>counting</i> and <i>maximal</i>
states are grouped together on the STD to share a single
transition associated with the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>reset</i></font>
button. This is interpreted to mean that when the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>reset</i></font> button is pressed in either the <i>counting</i>
or <i>maximal</i> state the transition which returns the
application to the <i>minimal</i> state is followed. </p>

<p>This design prevents the user from requesting an action which
the application is unable to provide by dividing the behavioral
space of the application into three distinct states. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A <b><i>state</i></b> in a <b><i>State Transition Diagram</i></b>
    is defined as a place in the behavioral space of the
    application which is functionally <b><i><u>and</u></i></b>
    visually distinct from all other places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This final refinement of the design also illustrates another
fundamental design principle. </p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><i>Design Advice</i></b> </p>
    <p>It is better to prevent the user from making 'errors',
    than to allow them to make the 'error' and have to explain it
    to them. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The final STD is an explicit specification of the interface
which is to be built. It can also be used as the basis of the
software design and, once the interface has been constructed, be
used to verify that the product implements its specification. It
also focuses the developer's attention upon the usability of the
product from the outset of the design process and thus hopefully
ensures that usable interfaces are constructed. It cannot be
guaranteed that interfaces constructed from STDs will be found
acceptable by all eventual end users, but it is more likely that
an interface with a formal usability design will be found so. </p>

<p>As with all design processes the design notation should be
used to explore different possibilities. In this example four
different STD designs for the interface were considered. It is
clearly preferable for the implications and consequences of
different behaviors to be explored at this stage, with pencil and
paper, than to construct an interface and discover it to be
inadequate or inappropriate. </p>
