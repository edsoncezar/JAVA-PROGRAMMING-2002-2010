<h1 align="center">7.8 Evaluating the interfaces</h1>

<p>There are now four interfaces for the control of a <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font> and the question of
which is the best interface might be raised, not only in the
context of controlling a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font>
but also for any other application. However the question has no
easy answer and will depend upon the nature of the application,
the nature of the task which it is being used for and the nature
of the user who is performing the task. All that can be attempted
is that, given a specific application and task with a particular
type of user, a comparison of different interfaces can be made
and some of these results might be generalised. </p>

<p>Any user interface should be <i>effective</i>, <i>efficient</i>
and <i>enjoyable</i>. Effective in the sense that it allows tasks
to be performed, efficient in the sense that it allows the tasks
to be performed without undue stress or effort and enjoyable in
the sense that the users will report that they take pleasure, or
at least feel neutral, about using the interface. This
description of user interfaces provides the basis of the
techniques which can be used to evaluate them. A representative
set of users can be selected, or obtained, and required to
perform some task. Their actions whilst they are performing the
task can be observed, recorded or measured and their attitude
towards the interface can be established after they have
completed it.</p>

<p>To evaluate the four <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font>
interfaces a specific task, or series of tasks, could be
established and described to the user. In order to ensure that
the task being presented to the user is one of controlling the <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font> and not a test of
their trigonometric or artistic abilities the instructions should
include the lengths of the lines and the angles of the turns. A
possible task is shown in Figure 7.6.</p>

evaluation task.</p>

<p>To conduct the investigation correctly the experiences of each
group of users, known as <i>subjects</i>, should be as identical
as possible. This relies upon an investigation protocol being
produced which states exactly what the person conducting the
investigation should say regarding the purpose of the
investigation, what is expected of the subjects and what the
investigator can say if a subject asks for help. The protocol
might then allow a period of time, say about 15 minutes, during
which the user is allowed to freely explore the interface before
the specific task is introduced. </p>

<p>The measurements which can be made upon the subject's
behaviour while attempting the task include: </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>the degree of completion of the task. <br>
            </li>
        <li>the total time taken to complete the task. <br>
            </li>
        <li>the number of commands used. <br>
            </li>
        <li>the number of mistakes made. <br>
            </li>
        <li>the number of times help is requested.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The attitude of the subject can be established by using a
questionnaire after they have completed the task. A common form
of questionnaire is made up from Leikert scales which have five
possible responses, as shown in Figure 7.7. This can be converted
to a numeric response by scoring a middle response as 0, negative
responses as -1 and -2 and positive responses as +1 and +2. As
indicated in the sample given, to prevent the subject from just
ticking all the boxes down a column a mixture of positive and
negative statements should be used. </p>

<p>This approach can be used proactively as well as reactively.
That is, a specification of the required usability of an
interface can be produced while the functional specification of
the software is being prepared. A very simple <i>usability
specification</i> for a word processing system might be as
follows. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>The task is to open a new, empty document and type in a
    given paragraph which involves making some words bold and
    some italic. The paragraph should then be printed and the
    document stored in a file in the default directory.</i></p>
    <p><i>A subject who has very little experience of using
    computers should be able to complete this task within 30
    minutes making less than 10 errors and report an overall
    neutral attitude. A subject who uses a computer on a
    semi-regular basis, at least once a week, should be able to
    complete the task in 15 minutes making less than 5 errors and
    report an overall positive attitude. A subject who uses a
    computer on a daily basis should be able to complete the task
    in less than 5 minutes making no errors and report an overall
    positive attitude.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the major problem with this approach to usability
engineering is the cost involved in performing the investigation.
Improvements to the usability of an interface, or a proposed
interface, can be more economically introduced by using a list of
heuristics, particularly when the list is applied by an expert.
One of the most widely used list of heuristics is that devised by
Neilsen and details of references which contain it are included
in Appendix A.</p>
