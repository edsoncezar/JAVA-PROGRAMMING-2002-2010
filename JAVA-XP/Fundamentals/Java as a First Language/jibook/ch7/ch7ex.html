<h1 align="center">Exercises for Chapter 7</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>7.1 </strong>Extend the text menu and the command
    line interface to accommodate the additional facilities
    available in the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>GeometricTuttle</i></font>
    class from Exercise 4.4.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.2</strong> Redesign, and subsequently
    re-implement, the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextMenuTuttle</i></font>'s
    <i>Move</i> and <i>Turn</i> menus so that the user can move
    or turn the tuttle an arbitrary number of units. This could
    be accomplished, for example when moving the tuttle forwards,
    by interposing a menu which offers two further menus labelled
    <i>tens</i> and <i>units</i>. The <i>tens</i> menu should
    offer items which move the tuttle <i>10</i>, <i>20</i>, <i>30</i>
    steps etc. and the <i>units</i> menu items to move it <i>1</i>,
    <i>2</i>, <i>3</i> steps etc. So if the user wanted to move
    the tuttle 47 steps they could activate the <i>Move/&nbsp;Forwards/&nbsp;tens/&nbsp;40</i>
    item followed by the <i>Move/&nbsp;Forwards/&nbsp;units/&nbsp;7</i>
    item. <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.3 </strong>Is the irregularity of the menu
    structures, some returning to the higher level after being
    activated and some remaining in the same state, in the <font
    size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextMenuTuttle</i></font> interface
    a problem for the users? To determine this implement a
    version of the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextMenuTuttle</i></font>
    interface which is regular in its behaviour, then have two
    groups of users perform the same task, observing and
    recording their behaviour.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.4</strong> Extend the <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>TextTuttle</i></font> class so that it will
    accept synonyms for the commands. As a minimum each command
    should be allowed to be issued in its abbreviated and long
    form (&nbsp;e.g. fd and forward). Additionally actual
    synonyms should be provided (&nbsp;e.g. tr and rt, turn right
    and right turn). <br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.5</strong> Which of the four <font size="2"
    face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font> interfaces is the most
    effective? Which is the most efficient? And which is the most
    enjoyable? To decide upon these questions design a standard
    task and have four groups of users perform the task and
    observe and record their behaviour.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>7.6 </strong>Are the results of Exercise 7.5
    dependent upon the experience level of the users?<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>7.7</strong> Decide upon the most acceptable name
    for <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font> commands
    by producing a series of diagrams which illustrate what
    action the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>tuttle</i></font>
    will take and ask a sample of users what name they would give
    to the action. How much variability is there in the results
    you obtain? What is the most popular name for each action?
    How does the list of most popular names compare with the list
    of commands as presented in this chapter? What does this tell
    you about naming commands? <br>
    </p>
