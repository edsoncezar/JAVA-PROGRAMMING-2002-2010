<h1 align="center">Chapter 7 Text based user interfaces</h1>

<p>In this chapter two further styles of user interface will be
developed for the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
class. The first interface to be presented is a <i>text&nbsp;menu</i>
style of interface, where the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
is controlled from a set of text menus displayed below the
drawing area. The menu bar based pull-down menu, from the
previous chapter, is not particularly suitable for controlling a <i>tuttle</i>,
due to the constant mouse movements required to use it. The text
menu style of interface has many of the advantages of a pull-down
menu system, but allows the menus to be used from the keyboard
without having to continually locate the mouse and use it to
navigate the menus.</p>

<p>The second interface style which will be presented in this
chapter is a <i>command line</i> system. In this interface style
the user is presented with an empty text input area and is
expected to learn and remember the commands, and their syntax,
which the tuttle will respond to. This style of interface is the
most difficult to learn but it can be the most powerful for an
experienced user to operate. It is also the traditional style of
interface for a Logo style turtle.</p>

<p>In order to implement these interfaces the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font> class from Chapter 4 will be
extended to produce a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextTuttle</i></font>
class which will accept and process commands passed to it as <font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>String</i></font>s. The advantages of
this refinement for the text menu style of interface may not be
immediately obvious, however when the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Tuttle</i></font>
hierarchy is further extended in the following chapter the
advantages will become clearer.</p>
