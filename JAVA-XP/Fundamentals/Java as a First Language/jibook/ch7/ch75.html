<p>The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>CommandLineTuttle</i></font>
interface provides the traditional method of instructing a tuttle
and, for experienced users, provides the most efficient and
powerful mechanism. The appearance of the <font size="2"
face="Arial"><i>CommandLineTuttle</i></font> interface is shown
in Figure 7.5.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b><img src="fig75.gif"

<p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Figure 7.5</b> The </font><font
size="2" face="Arial"><i>CommandLineTuttle</i></font><font
size="2"> interface, (with the drawing area reduced in height).</font></p>

<p>The single line <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextField</i></font>
at the very bottom of the interface is used by the user to type
in the commands. Above it a <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextArea</i></font>
records the commands which the user has issued and also outputs
any messages from the tuttle to the user. Every command which the
user inputs is echoed in the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextArea</i></font>
preceded by a chevron (&nbsp;<b>&gt;</b>&nbsp;) and any messages
from the interface in response to the command are shown below it.
The <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextArea</i></font> provides a
<i>history&nbsp;list</i> of the commands which have been issued
which the user can use to refresh their memory of what has
happened and also can us to copy commands from it to paste into
the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextField</i></font>. </p>

<p>The design of the language used to command the tuttle is
implicit in the <font size="2" face="Arial"><i>TextTuttle</i></font>
class. The commands should be constructed in a regular manner; in
this example each command consists of a verb, for example <i>forward</i>,
and is possibly followed by a single argument, for example <i>100</i>.
This should never be reversed, for example stating the color
followed by <i>background</i> or <i>foreground</i> (&nbsp;e.g. <i>green&nbsp;foreground</i>&nbsp;).
</p>

<p>The abbreviations used for the verbs have likewise been chosen
in a regular manner, using key letters from the full name of the
command. Although it should not be assumed that these are always
unambiguous, for example the command <i>turn&nbsp;right</i>
(&nbsp;<i>tr</i>&nbsp;) could just as easily have been <i>right&nbsp;turn</i>
(&nbsp;<i>rt</i>&nbsp;) or even <i>clockwise</i> (&nbsp;<i>cw</i>&nbsp;).
An alternative technique for the selection of the abbreviations
might be to use the first two unique letters of a command. </p>

<p>A more complete command line system might employ synonymous
commands, for example the <i>turn&nbsp;right</i> command could be
issued as: <i>turn right</i>, <i>right turn</i>, <i>tr</i> or <i>rt</i>.
(One famous example of the mis-use of this consideration is an
interface which, when the command <i>exit</i> is given, responds
&quot;<i>If you want to exit the application you must type 'quit'</i>.&quot;).
As with icons there are techniques which can be used to identify
a set of verbs, and an associated syntax, which are most
acceptable to the users. </p>

    <p><b><i>Design Advice</i></b> </p>
    <p>The language of a command line interface should be
    constructed so as to be as regular and predictable as
    possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>There is one exception to the regularity of the command
language used in this interface. The <i>exit</i> command does not
have an abbreviation and must be given as &quot;<i>exit&nbsp;please</i>&quot;.
The reason for this is that the consequences of using the exit
command by accident are so severe that the irregularity is
intended to reduce the probability of this happening. However, it
can also be predicted that for a very experienced user this
effect will be lost. For example the MS&nbsp;DOS delete command <i>del</i>
will ask for a confirmation if it is used to delete all the files
in a directory: (&nbsp;<b><i>C&gt;</i></b><i>del&nbsp;*.*</i> \n <i>Are
you sure (Y/N)&nbsp;</i><i><u>y</u></i><i>&nbsp;)</i>. An
experienced user will conceptually compile this sequence of two
operations into a single operation and, on occasion, will use the
compiled sequence by accident. </p>

<p>As there is so much potential uncertainty, for the user, in
the format of the commands an effective <i>help</i> facility is
essential for all command line interfaces. This is vital for
novice users of the interface who, when presented with a blank
command line for the first time, may have no idea of what to do.
It is also essential for very experienced users who may use many
different command line systems and can become confused on a
particular system. For example: the commands to exit from
different command line systems include: <i>exit</i>, <i>quit</i>,
<i>logout</i>, <i>system</i> and <i>bye</i>. The details of the
help facility for the tuttle command line system are indicated in
Figure 7.5 and will be presented in the description of its
implementation below. </p>
