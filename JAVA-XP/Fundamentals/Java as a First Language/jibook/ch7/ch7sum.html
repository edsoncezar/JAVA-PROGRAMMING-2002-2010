<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Text menus have many of the advantages of pull-down
            menu systems but they can be controlled from the
            keyboard and so avoid the necessity of having to
            transfer attention to the mouse. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>Command line systems can be the most powerful for
            experienced users but can be intimidating to novice
            users. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>The syntax of command line systems should be as
            regular as possible and designed with care. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>An effective help system is essential for command
            line interfaces. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>Feedback in a command line system should include a
            history list of commands issued. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>Any user interface should be effective, efficient and
            enjoyable. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>Evaluation of an interface by the use of structured
            investigations can be very powerful, but it is also
            very expensive. <br>
            <br>
            </li>
        <li>Evaluation of an interface by the use of heuristics
            is the most cost effective way of improving its
            usability, particularly when it is carried out by a
            usability expert.<br>
            </li>
    </ul>
