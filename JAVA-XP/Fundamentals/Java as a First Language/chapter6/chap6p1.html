<h2>6.1 The <i>BasicMenu</i> user interface<br>
</h2>

<p>
The starting point for the design of any program, or program component,
which will interact with the user is to specify the pattern of
communication which will happen between the program and the user.
This can be thought of as a conversation between the interface
designer and the end user, and will be most satisfying to the
user if the computer's side of the conversation is conducted with
a maximum degree of respect and support. For example, when the
user does not respond as expected it should not be regarded or
reported as an error, but as a misunderstanding. The reason why
the response is unacceptable should be explained and the range
and/&nbsp;or format of acceptable responses should be described.
<br>

<p>
The design of the user interface for the <i>BasicMenu</i> is as
follows. <br>

<p>
<hr>
<pre>
		This is a title for the menu

	This is the first option.
	This is the second option.
	This is the third option.

	This is the prompt <u><i><b>Z</b></i></u>

	  Please enter a response between A and C.

	This is the prompt <u><i><b>a</b></i></u>
<hr>
<p>
</pre>

<p>
The menu starts with a <i>title</i>, which can be specified by
the developer, and is followed by a sequence of <i>options</i>
each of which is labelled with an upper case character. There
is no limit upon the number of options which the <i>BasicMenu</i>
can present, but good user interface designs do not have more
than about 7 options so as not to overload the user with choices.
The list of options is followed by a <i>prompt</i>, which can
be specified by the developer and the menu will then wait for
the user to type in a response terminated with the &lt;ENTER&gt;
key. Only the first character that the user types will be regarded
as their response, any other characters will be ignored. <br>

<p>
If the user types in a character which does not correspond to
one of the menu options a message, as shown, indicating which
responses are acceptable, will be output and the user will be
asked to input a response again. There is no limit upon the number
of attempts which the user can have to supply a valid response.
Once the user has supplied an acceptable character, either in
upper or lower case, the menu will terminate.<br>

<p>
The example above illustrates a menu with three options and shows
the user first inputting an upper case <i><b>Z</b></i> character.
The message 'Please enter a response between A and C' is output
to guide the user before the prompt is repeated. The second response
from the user is a lower case <i><b>a</b></i> character, which
is acceptable, and the menu terminates.<br>
