<h2>Chapter 6 Summary<br>
</h2>

<h2><ul>
<li>a user interface is a conversation between the computer and
the user designed by the developer. 
<p><li>an iterative data structure is known as an array and is shown
as an iterated component on a data structure diagram.
<p><li>arrays can be sized implicitly as they are declared or explicitly
when they are constructed. 
<p><li>the <font FACE="Arial">length</font> attribute of an
array indicates the number of elements which it contains.
<p><li><font FACE="Arial">System.in</font> can be used as
a raw input stream, but is more useful if it is used to construct
a <font FACE="Arial">DataInputStream</font>.
<p><li>the number of times a definite iteration will iterate can
be known by the time Java reaches the loop and is implemented
by a <b><font FACE="Arial">for</font></b> loop.
<p><li>the number of times an indefinite iteration will iterate cannot
be known until the loop is reached and is implemented in Java
by a <b><font FACE="Arial">while</font></b> loop.
<p><li>a pre-increment operation, e.g. <font FACE="Arial">++variable</font>,
increments the value and then references it. A post-increment
operation, e.g. <font FACE="Arial">variable++</font>, references
the value before incrementing it.
<p><li>exception handling can be designed with a posit/&nbsp;admit
appoach and implemented in Java as a <b><font FACE="Arial">try/&nbsp;catch</font></b>
structure. 
<p><li>two boolean values can be combined with an or (&nbsp;||&nbsp;)
operator.
