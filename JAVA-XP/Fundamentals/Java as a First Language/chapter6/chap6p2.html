<p>
The constructor requires as arguments the <i>title</i> for the
menu, the <i>prompt</i> to be used and the <i>options</i> which
are to be offered. The square brackets of the <i>options</i> argument
indicate that this is an iteration which can contain a number
of individual options. <br>

<p>
Two public actions are exported, <i>offerMenuAsChar</i> and <i>offerMenuAsInt</i>,
each of these offers the menu to the user and then conducts a
conversation with the user to obtain a valid response. The <i>offerMenuAsChar</i>
action will return the user's response as an upper case character
identifying which option was selected. The <i>offerMenuAsInt</i>
action returns the user's response as an integer value with 1
identifying the first option, 2 the second and so on. The reasons
for this second action will be explained when the demonstration
harnesses are introduced. The class diagram also indicates a private
action, called <i>showMenu</i>, which will actually offer the
menu to the user. This is known to be a private action, as opposed
to a private data attribute, as it contains a verb phrase not
a noun phrase.<br>

<p>
Additionally a number of semi public actions are shown on the
left of the diagram. These have been provided in order to allow
the menu to be extended and their meaning and use will be described
below.<br>
