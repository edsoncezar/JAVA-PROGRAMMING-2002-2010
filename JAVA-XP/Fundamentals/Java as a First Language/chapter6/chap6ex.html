<h2>Exercises for Chapter 6<br>
</h2>

<h3>
<ul>
<p>
6.1 Extend the demonstration harnesses so that they provide a
more comprehensive demonstration that the <i>BasicMenu</i> class
operates correctly. For example, it has only been demonstrated
with three options.<br>

<p>
6.2 Re-implement the <i>BasicMenu</i> constructor so that it throws
a suitable exception, which should not be caught, if it is called
with zero or one options. Demonstrate that the exception is thrown
when appropriate.<br>

<p>
6.3 The catch part of the exception handler in the <i>offerMenuAsInt</i>()
action should propogate the exception by raising its own specific
exception. Re-implement the action to accomplish this and then
demonstrate it by generating an end of file character from the
keyboard. (Under MS&nbsp;Dos an end of file is a &lt;CONTROL&gt;C
press, under Unix a &lt;CONTOL&gt;D and on some other systems
&lt;CONTROL&gt;Z).<br>

<p>
6.4 Implement and demonstrate, using <i>offerMenuAsInt(),</i>
a menu which offers choices for payment by cash, cheque, debit
card and credit card, as introduced in the <i>MultipleRegister</i>
class from Chapter 5. <br>
<br>
</ul>
