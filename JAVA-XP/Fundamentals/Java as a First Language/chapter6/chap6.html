<h1>Chapter 6 The <i>BasicMenu</i> class<br>
</h1>

<p>
All the programs which have been used so far have only produced
<i>output</i> on the screen and have not required the user to
<i>input</i> any information from the keyboard. Inputting information
is much more complex than outputting information as it cannot
be assumed that the user will always respond as expected to any
instructions which they are given.<br>

<p>
This chapter will introduce a <i>BasicMenu</i> class, instances
of which can be constructed to offer a number of options and obtain
a validated response from the user. In order to do this techniques
for representing and manipulating single characters, and sequences
of characters known as <i>Strings</i>, will have to be introduced.
Each option presented to the user on the menu is represented as
a string and as a number of options have to be presented the techniques
for representing an <i><b>iteration</b></i> of strings will also
have to be introduced. <i><b>Iteration</b></i> is the technical
term for a <i><b>repetition</b></i>, either of data objects or
of actions. The term iteration is preferred as an iteration can
represent zero occurrences whereas a repetition implies at least
one occurrence. <br>

<p>
When the user is presented with the opportunity to respond to
the menu it cannot be assumed that they will provide a valid input.
Should this happen they will have to be informed that their input
is not acceptable and be allowed to respond again. Thus the program
will have to iterate a sequence of actions and the techniques
for implementing this will be introduced. <br>

<p>
The <i>BasicMenu</i> demonstration harneses will present a standard
<i>menu/&nbsp;dispatch</i> design which can be used as a basic
design in other applications. The following chapter will illustrate
such an application and extend the <i>BasicMenu</i> to produce
a menu which can dynamically change the options which it offers.
