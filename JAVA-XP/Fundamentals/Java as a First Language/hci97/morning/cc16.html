<h3>
The instance needs to know the identity of its Applet, 
upon construction, in order for it to be mounted within its display panel and 
also to be able to dispatch events to it.
</h3>
<p>
<h3>
The three possible states of the interface can be set and controlled by 
use of the three public actions. The value shown on the display is set 
by the <i>setValueDisplay()</i> action. 
</h3>
<p>
<h3>
The interface has no knowledge of its role as a counter. All it 'knows' 
is how to set the text in the value display, how to set its button states 
and where to send events when the user clicks one of the buttons.
</h3>
