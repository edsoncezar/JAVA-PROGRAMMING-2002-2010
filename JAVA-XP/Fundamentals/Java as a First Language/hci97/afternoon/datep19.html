<center><h1>The <i>DatePanel</i> class - class diagram 2</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>
The <i>DatePanel</i> has to receive
events generated by its century, decade, year and month Choice
components and so it has to implement the <i>ItemListener</i>
interface, supplying the <i>itemStateChanged()</i>
action. It also has to listen to ActionEvents
generated by its <i>MonthPanel</i> and
so supplies an <i>actionPerformed()</i>
action. 
</h3>
<p>
<h3>
As well as being the recipient of events from its contained components
it is also the source of ActionEvents
whenever its date is changed and, in order to be compliant with other
components supplies <i>addActionListener(),
removeActionListener(), setActionCommand()</i> and <i>getActionCommand()</i>
actions. This allows it to register multiple listeners and all
will have an event dispatched to them when appropriate.
</h3>
<p>
<h3>
The default constructor  provides a panel with the current system
date, the alternative with the date as supplied by its arguments.
Once constructed the date can be changed by the <i>setDate()</i>
action and the three remaining actions allow each constituent
of the date to be enquired.
