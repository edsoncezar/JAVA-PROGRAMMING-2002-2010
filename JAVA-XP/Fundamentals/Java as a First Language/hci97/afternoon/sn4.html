<h3>
The <i><font FACE="Arial">MessageCanvas</font></i> class can be
thought of as a (simplified) multi-line version of the 
<font FACE="Arial">Label</font>
class.<br>
</h3>
<p>
<h3>
Its constructor requires the message which it is to display
as an argument and, once constructed, is immutable. The 
<i><font FACE="Arial">addNotify()</font></i>
action will be called when its component peer has been constructed
and information relating to the actual environment which it is
operating within can be obtained. The <i><font FACE="Arial">paint()</font></i>
action is supplied in order for the instance to be able to present
itself on the screen and the <i><font FACE="Arial">getMinimumSize()</font></i>
and <i><font FACE="Arial">getPreferredSize()</font></i> are required
for it to take part in geometry negotiations. <br>
</h3>
<p>
<h3>
Geometry negotiations are performed when a <font FACE="Arial">Panel</font>
lays out its children. Each is asked in turn for its preferred
size and if these can be accommodated within the <font FACE="Arial">Panel</font>'s
layout management policy and its available size, will be granted.
Otherwise their minimum sizes will be asked for and possibly granted.
A component should not assume anything about the amount of space
which it has been allocated. <br>
