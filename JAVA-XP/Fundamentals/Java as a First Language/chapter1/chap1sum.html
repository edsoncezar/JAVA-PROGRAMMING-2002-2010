<h2>Summary of Chapter 1<br>
</h2>
<h4>
<ul>
<p>
<li>The software development process starts with a precise specification
of what a software artefact is to do.
<p>
<li>To deal with complexity software artefacts are produced from
a number of different objects each of which is an instance of
some class.
<p>
<li>Objects are designed using <i><b>class diagrams</b></i> which
show what services an instance of the class being designed will
offer its clients. 
<p>
<li>An <i><b>instance diagram</b></i> illustrates the actual object
instances which are used in a client program.
<p>
<li>Each class is defined in a separate source code file which contains
the declarations of the actions which it supplies. 
<p>
<li>The first line of an action declaration which states the action's
visibility, return type, name and arguments is known as its <i><b>signature</b></i>.

<p>
<li>A class offering an action called <i>main()</i>
with a strictly defined signature will become the <i><b>client
program</b></i> where execution of the program starts.  
<p>
<li>Actions are designed, and documented, using JSP notation 
<p>
<li>The choice of names and the layout of the source code within
program files is subject to a set of rules and conventions. <br>
<br>
