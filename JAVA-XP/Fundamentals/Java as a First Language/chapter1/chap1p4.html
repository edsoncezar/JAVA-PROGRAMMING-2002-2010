<h2>1.4 The <i>UltimateAnswer</i> class<br>
</h2>

<p>
The <i>UltimateAnswer</i> class
has a single purpose in this application, to provide a client
program which makes use of a <i>TheAnswer</i>
object; its class diagram is given in Figure 1.3.<br>

<center>Figure 1.3. The <i>UltimateAnswer</i> class diagram.<br>
</center>
<p>
This diagram indicates that the class supplies a single action
called <i>main()</i>, which requires
arguments to be supplied to it and does not supply any information.
An action called <i>main()</i>,
with a strictly required signature, is recognised by Java as a
<i><b>client&nbsp;program</b></i> and, as explained above, Java
will automatically execute it when the program starts running.
The implementation of this design is as follows. <br>

<pre>
0001  // Filename <i>UltimateAnswer.java</i>.
0002  // Initial Java client program written for 
0003  // the JOF book chapter 1 - see text.
0004  //
0005  // Fintan Culwin, V0.1, August 1997.
0006  
0007  <b>import</b> <i>TheAnswer</i>;
0008  
0009  <b>public class</b> <i>UltimateAnswer</i> { 
0010  
0011     <b>public static void</b> <i>main</i>( String <i>args</i>[]) { 
0012     
0013     <i>TheAnswer</i> <i>anAnswerObject</i> = <b>new</b> <i>TheAnswer</i>();
0014  
0015        System.out.println();   
0016        System.out.println( &quot;The answer to life,&quot;);
0017        System.out.print( &quot;the Universe and everything is &quot;);
0018        System.out.print( <i>anAnswerObject.theAnswerIs()</i>);
0019        System.out.println( &quot;.&quot;);
0020     } // End main.
0021  
0022  } // End <i>UltimateAnswer</i>.<br>

</pre>

<p>
Lines 0001 to 0005 are again the header comments which identify
who, what, why, where, when, etc. for this program file. The <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
class is declared between lines 0009 and 0022. Before this line
0007 states that this class makes use of the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class using the Java <b>import</b> statement, as indicated on
the instance diagram in Figure 1.1.<br>

<p>
The declaration of the <i>main()</i>
action is between lines 0011 and 0020. Line 0011 contains the
signature required for a <i>main()</i>
action if it is to found and used by Java as a program.<br>

<p>
Line 0013 is required to create an instance of the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class which can be used by the <i>main()</i>
action. The first part of the line: <i>TheAnswer
anAnswerObject</i> states that an object of the <i>TheAnswer
</i>class will be required and that it will be referred
to as <i>anAnswerObject</i> in
this action. However it does not actually create an instance of
the class. The <b>new</b> <i>TheAnswer()</i>
part of the line actually creates the instance by using the constructor
action<i> TheAnswer().</i> This
action is not explicitly provided by the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class declaration so a suitable constructor action is automatically
supplied by Java. More complex class declarations will have to
provide one, or more, constructors; this will be further explained
in the next chapter. The process of creating an instance of a
class in this way is known as <i><b>instantiation</b></i>. <br>

<p>
The statements which form the <i>main()</i>
action, given on lines 0015 to 0018, make use of the <i>System.out.println()</i>
as in the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
application, and also of the <i>System.out.print()</i>
action. The difference between a <i>println()</i>
and a<i> print()</i> action is
that <i>println() </i>will complete
a line of output and move onto the next line of the screen. The
<i>print() </i>action<i> </i>will
not advance to the next line, so subsequent output will appear
on the same screen line. <br>

<p>
Line 0015 is again included to provide a blank line on the screen
before the rest of the output from this application appears. Line
0016 provides the first line of output required by the specification
and line 0017 the first part of the second line. As line 0017
uses a <i>print()</i>, as opposed
to a <i>println()</i>, action
subsequent output from the program will appear on the same line
on the screen. <br>

<p>
The argument to the <i>println()</i>
action on line 0018 is not enclosed in quotes and this indicates
to Java that it should attempt to work out what the argument means,
and then output that meaning. The argument, <i>anAnswerObject.theAnswerIs()</i>,
indicates that the <i>theAnswerIs()</i>
action of the <i>anAnswerObject</i>
instance should be asked to provide its meaning. As explained
above <i>theAnswerIs()</i> will
always <b>return</b> the value &quot;forty two&quot; and this,
stripped of its opening and closing string quotes, will be output
to the screen. The last action, on line 0019, outputs a full stop
(&nbsp;.&nbsp;) completing screen output, before the <i>main()</i>
action and thus the program finishes. <br>

<p>
By considering the sequence of output which is produced by the
actions on lines 0015 to 0019 it can be shown that the program
will produce on the screen exactly what is required to satisfy
its specification.<br>
