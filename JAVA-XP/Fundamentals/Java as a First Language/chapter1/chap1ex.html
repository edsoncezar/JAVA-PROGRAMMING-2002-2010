<h2>Exercises for Chapter 1<br>
</h2>
<h4>
<p>
<b>1.1</b> In order to participate in active learning it will be necessary
to develop Java programs. Obtain a copy of the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
file from this chapter, or even type it in by hand, and make sure
that you can compile and execute the resulting program. <br>

<p>
<b>1.2</b> A large number of technical terms have been introduced in
this chapter, they are highlighted in the text by the use of <i><b>bold
italics</b></i>. Produce a glossary of terms using your own words
to explain their meanings. Do not worry if your understanding
of some of the explanations is vague, but return to the declarations
after the next chapter and clarify them further.<br>

<p>
<b>1.3</b> Adapt the listing of the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
class so that it makes use of two String
instances, one for each line of the output. Then adapt it again
so that it makes no use of any <i>String</i>
objects, specifying each line of output in quotes as an argument
to <i>println()</i>. Is there
any way that a user of the program could know which technique
was used?<br>

<p>
<b>1.4</b> Obtain a copy of the <i>UltimateAnswer
</i> and <i>theAnswer</i>
files from this chapter, or even type them in by hand, and make
sure that you can compile them and execute the resulting program.
<br>

<p>
<b>1.5</b> Adapt the designs and the source code from this chapter so
that a class called <i>MyDetails</i>
offers two actions called <i>myNameIs()</i>
and <i>myPhoneNumberIs()</i>,
both of which should return Strings.
The client should be called <i>MyDetailsClient</i>
and when executed it will output your name and phone number with
suitable messages. Design, build and demonstrate this class.
