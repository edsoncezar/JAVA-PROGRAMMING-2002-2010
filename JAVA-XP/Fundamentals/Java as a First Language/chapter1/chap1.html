<h1>Chapter 1 Two Initial Applications<br>
</h1>

<p>
This book is concerned with the production of <i><b>software artefacts</b></i>
using the programming language Java, a process known as <i><b>software
development</b></i>. Software artefacts include programs which
enable a user to perform some specified task and components which
are intended to be used in their construction. Software development
is an engineering process which ensures that the artefacts are
produced with due regard to their required quality. Most significantly
the engineering process requires the production of a design prior
to the production of a program, and the testing of the artefact
to assure its quality when it is developed.<br>

<p>
Java is a programming language which assists in the development
of quality artefacts by providing an environment which supports
sound software engineering principles and prevents many of the
most obvious flaws which have permeated programs produced using
older languages. It also includes support for the production of
small applications, called <i><b>applets</b></i>, which can be
transmitted across the Internet and executed within World Wide
Web browsers.<br>

<p>
It is possible for small programs, which are only intended to
be used by the developer to perform a simple task, to be produced
without following a defined development process. However most
applications are produced by a team of developers and are intended
to be used to perform complex tasks by a wide range of users.
The techniques which can be used for the development of small
programs are not suitable for the production of complex applications.
<br>

<p>
When a novice developer is producing their first programs there
is a great temptation to concentrate upon the program code and
to avoid the other aspects, such as design, which seem irrelevant.
This is a very short sighted and dangerous approach as it will
establish habits which subsequently have to be unlearned; and
unlearning incorrect skills is much more difficult than learning
the correct skills in the first place. <br>

<p>
There are many other considerations concerned with the software
development process which could be presented and discussed before
the production of software is introduced. However as the philosophy
of this book is concerned with active learning this chapter will
shortly continue with the production of two initial applications.
<br>

<p>
There are many concepts introduced in the rest of this chapter
and two strategies are suggested to deal with its complexity.
The first is to complete all the exercises at the end of the chapter,
carefully following through all the design and production stages
described in the chapter. The second suggestion is to return to
this chapter after finishing the second chapter, and the third
chapter etc. in order to consolidate and extend the initial understanding
obtained when it is followed through for the first time. Gaining
a complete understanding of a concept takes time and effort. An
initial understanding may well be fuzzy and partial but it should
become clearer and more complete through careful consideration
and practical activities which lead to active learning:<br>

reading this book, it is also necessary to actually develop some
software.
