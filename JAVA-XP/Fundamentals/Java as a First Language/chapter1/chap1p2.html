<h2>1.2 The <i>UltimateAnswer</i> application<br>
</h2>

<p>
The <i>UltimateQuestion</i> application,
as presented above, was a very unusual Java program as it consisted
of a single class which contained a single action. It would be
much more typical for a program to constructed from a number of
different classes each of which contained a number of different
actions. In order to start to move towards this situation a program
will be developed in this part of the chapter which contains two
classes each of which contains a single action. The next chapter
will continue with programs which contain more than two classes
each of which may contain more than a single action.<br>

<p>
The specification for this application, called <i>UltimateAnswer</i>,
is to provide the answer to the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
as asked in the previous section. When executed this application
is to produce the following output.<br>

<p>
<hr>
<ul>
<pre>
The answer to life, 
the Universe and everything is forty two.
</pre>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>
This application will be constructed from two classes; one called
<i>TheAnswer</i> which knows
the value of the ultimate answer and one called <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
which will communicate it to the user. This is a commonplace architecture
where the detailed computation of some information, for example:
the number of people in a room or the value of an amount of British
Pounds in American dollars or the visualisation of the inside
of a human skull from a CAT scanner, etc. is supplied by one class
and the interaction with the user is handled by a second class.
The relationship between the classes can be illustrated by an
<i><b>object instance diagram</b></i>, as shown in Figure 1.1.

<center>Figure 1.1. Instance diagram for the <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
application<br>
</center>
<p>
The rectangular boxes at the top of the diagram represent the
classes which are being used and the hexagonal boxes at the bottom
instances of these classes. The diagram indicates, on the right,
that the application object, known as the <i><b>client program</b></i>,
is an instance of the <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
class. Similarly the left of the diagram indicates that a single
instance of the <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
class called <i>anAnswerObject</i>
is required. The <i>anAnswerObject</i>
exists in the program in order that the client program can ask
it for the value of the ultimate answer. Thus the client program
makes use of the <i>anAnswerObject</i>
instance as indicated by the arrow connecting them; alternatively
the client program can be regarded as a <i><b>client</b></i> of
the <i>UltimateAnswer</i> class
and its instance. <br>

<p>
The most appropriate way of constructing this application is to
design and implement the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class before considering its client. A <i><b>class</b></i> can
be thought of a pattern or blueprint from which any number of
<i><b>instances</b></i>, known as <i><b>objects</b></i>, of the
class can be produced.<br>
