<h2>1.1 The <i>UltimateQuestion</i> application<br>
</h2>

<p>
The first application which will be introduced will state the
question to life, the Universe and everything as first stated
by Douglas Adams in 'The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy'. The
first stage in the production of any software artefact is to establish
exactly what it is supposed to do, a process known as <i><b>specification</b></i>.
The specification for the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
program is that, when executed, it will produce the following
output on the computer's screen.<br>


<p>
<hr>
<ul>
<pre>
What is the answer to, 
life the Universe and everything?
</pre>
</ul>
<hr>


<p>
The source code of a Java program, called <i>UltimateQuestion</i>,
which satisfies this requirement might be as follows. <br>

<pre>
0001 // Filename <i>UltimateQuestion.java</i>.
0002 // Initial Java program written for 
0003 // the JOF book chapter 1 - see text.
0004 //
0005 // Fintan Culwin, V0.1, August 1997.
0006 
0007 <b>public class</b> <i>UltimateQuestion</i> { 
0008 
0009    <b>public static void</b> <i>main</i>( String <i>args</i>[]) { 
0010    
0011    String <i>secondLine</i> =  &quot;life, the Universe and everything?&quot;;
0012    
0013       System.out.println();
0014       System.out.println( &quot;What is the answer to,&quot; );
0015       System.out.println( <i>secondLine</i>);
0016    } // End <i>main</i>.
0017 
0018 } // End <i>UltimateQuestion</i>.<br>

</pre>

<p>
The program listings which are presented in this book use <b>bold
type</b> to indicate words which are reserved by Java for its
own use; these are known as <i><b>reserved words</b></i>. <i>Italic
type</i> is used to indicate names which have been chosen by the
developer; the rules for choosing names will be given below. Other
terms, in normal type, are used for facilities which are supplied
by the Java environment but are not strictly part of the language.
These conventions are intended to make the printed listings more
informative and should not be used for listings which are intended
to be used for production. <br>

<p>
Likewise the line numbers at the start of each line are used to
make it easier to indicate which line is being described and should
not be included in listings which are intended to be used for
the construction of artefacts. A version of the listing which
could be used would appear as follows. <br>

<pre>
// Filename UltimateQuestion.java.
// Initial Java program written for 
// the JOF book chapter 1 - see text.
//
// Fintan Culwin, V0.1, August 1997.

public class UltimateQuestion { 

   public static void main( String args[]) { 
   
   String secondLine =  &quot;life, the Universe and everything?&quot;;
   
      System.out.println();
      System.out.println( &quot;What is the answer to,&quot; );
      System.out.println( secondLine);
   } // End main.

} // End UltimateQuestion.<br>

</pre>

<p>
When a term from a program listing is used in the text this
font will be used and if the term is chosen by the developer
then <i>the font</i> will be
italicised. <i><b>Bold italics</b></i> will be used when a technical
term is introduced for the first time or when its meaning is significantly
elaborated.<br>

<p>
The first five lines of this listing all start with a double slash
(&nbsp;<b>//</b>&nbsp;), which tells Java to ignore the rest of
the line. The purpose of these lines is to inform anyone reading
the listing of what it contains, who wrote it, where they wrote
it, when they wrote it and possibly many other details as well.
Lines, or parts of lines, which are included for the benefit of
readers and ignored by Java are known as <i><b>comments</b></i>.
All program listing files should always start with a series of
similar comments identifying: who, what, where, why, when, etc.
Throughout the listing blank lines are occasionally inserted in
order to make the listing easier to read; these lines, for example
line 0008, will also be ignored by Java.<br>

<p>
Line 0007 is the start of the declaration of a <b>class</b>
called <i>UltimateQuestion</i>.
Almost everything in Java has to be a part of a class and the
name of the class dictates what name must be used to store the
file on the computer's disk. So, as this file contains the declaration
of the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
class, the filename used to store this listing must be <i>UltimateQuestion.java</i>;
as noted on line 0001 of the listing. The final character on line
0007 is an opening brace (&nbsp;<b>{</b>&nbsp;) which marks the
start of its declaration and is matched by the closing brace (&nbsp;<b>}</b>&nbsp;)
on line 0018.  Everything between these opening and closing braces
is the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
class.<br>

<p>
This class contains the declaration of a single <i><b>action</b></i>,
called <i>main()</i>, between
lines 0009 and 0016. A class which is intended to be used as a
program must contain the declaration of a <i>main</i>
action; and this declaration must appear exactly as shown on line
0009 if Java is to be able to find and execute it. The first term
on the line, <b>public</b>, makes
the declaration visible outside the class, otherwise it would
be invisible and so Java would be unable to find it for execution.
The two next terms, <b>static</b>
and <b>void</b>, are required
for reasons which will be explained later in this chapter and
in the next.<br>

<p>
The term <i>main</i> is shown
in italics even though the developer has no choice about what
this action is called. Although line 0009 must appear exactly
as shown in the listing the contents of the <i>main()</i>
action, between lines 0009 and 0016, are provided by the developer
and not by Java. So this is a developer supplied <i>main()</i>
action, not a main() action supplied
by Java and consequently italics are used to indicate this. The
main action is followed by a pair of round brackets <b>()</b>,
which enclose the <i><b>arguments</b></i> to the action. For a
<i>main</i> action the arguments must appear exactly as shown,
the meaning and use of these arguments will be fully explained
in a later chapter. <br>

<p>
The final term on line 0009 is an opening brace (&nbsp;<b>{</b>&nbsp;),
which marks the start of the declaration of the <i>main()</i>
action and is matched by a closing brace (&nbsp;<b>}</b>&nbsp;)
on line 0016. The closing brace on line 0016 is the end of the
<i>main()</i> declaration and
the closing brace on line 0018 is the end of the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
declaration. Braces are used to delineate the opening and closing
of many Java structures and, if care is not taken, it is very
easy to arrive a listings which might contain something like the
following.<br>

<pre>
	     }
	     }
	     }
	     }<br>

</pre>

<p>
Which is very difficult for anyone to understand. To avoid this
possibility two techniques are suggested. The first is to label
every closing brace with a comment, so line 0016 of the listing
is commented as the end of the <i>main()</i>
action and line 0018 as the end of the <i>UltimateQuestion</i>
class. The second technique is indentation, which means moving
the text of the lines to the right, by three spaces. So in the
<i>UltimateQuestion</i> listing
everything which is part of the class declaration, between lines
0007 and 0018, is indented. Likewise the contents of the <i>main()</i>
action, apart from line 0011, are further indented. By using these
conventions the confusing closing braces above might appear as
follows. <br>

<pre>
	              } // End <i>something</i>.
	           } // End <i>someOtherThing</i>.
	        } // End <i>penultimateThing</i>.
	     } // End <i>lastThing</i>.<br>

</pre>

<p>
Which is still confusing! But hopefully less so.<br>

<p>
An action declaration, like <i>main()</i>'s
action declaration, between lines 0009 and 0016 can contain two
types of <i><b>statements</b></i>. Statements which declare the
existence of <i><b>objects</b></i> and statements which declare
what is to be done with the objects, known as <i><b>steps</b></i>.
To assist in making this distinction clearer the object declarations
are all collected together at the start of the action, are not
indented and they are followed by the action's steps which are
indented. So the <i>main()</i>
action in this listing contains a single object declaration on
line 0011 followed by three steps on lines 0013 to 0016.<br>

<p>
The declaration on line 0011 states that a String
object called <i>secondLine</i>
containing the information &quot;life, the Universe and everything?&quot;
is required by <i>main()</i>.
A String is a sequence of individual
characters which together form a word, phrase or sentence. One
way of visualising what happens in line 0011 is that an object
with the following structure is created. <br>

<p>
<center>
<table BORDER="1">

<tr><td WIDTH="227"><center><i>secondLine</i></center>
</td></tr>

<tr><td WIDTH="227"><center>life, the Universe and everything?</center>
</td></tr>

<tr><td WIDTH="227"><center>String</center>
</td></tr>

</table>

<p>
</center>
<p>
The upper part of the diagram indicates the name of the object,
in this example <i>secondLine</i>
and, by the use of italics, indicates that it has been chosen
by the developer. The lower part of the diagram indicates what
type of object this is, in this example a String.
The middle part of the diagram indicates the value of the object
and as this is a String it has
to be a sequence of characters, as shown. The opening (&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;)
and closing (&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;) <i><b>string quotes</b></i> have
not been stored as part of its value. They are required in a listing
only to mark the start and end of a String,
but are discarded by Java when the String
is stored. <br>

<p>
All three steps of the <i>main()</i>
action, on lines 0013 to 0015, are instructions to Java to output
something onto the computer's display. The phrase System.out.println(&nbsp;&#133;&nbsp;)
means send what follows, inside the round brackets, to the next
line of the display. On line 0013 the brackets are empty and this
will cause an empty line to be sent to the screen. This causes
a blank line to appear on the screen before the rest of the output
from this program. <br>

<p>
On line 0014 the round brackets contain a string contained between
string quotes. Java will again strip the quotes from the string
and send it to the next line of the display, producing the first
line of output required by the specification. On line 0015 the
contents of the brackets are not enclosed by quote marks and so
Java knows that this is not a simple string to be output. Instead
Java attempts to determine what it might mean. The phrase <i>secondLine</i>
is known to Java from the declaration on line 0011 and it's value
is retrieved from the object and output. As shown in the visualisation
above this is the sequence of characters which form the second
line of the required output, completing the specification.<br>

<p>
Before leaving the detailed consideration of this listing, the
semicolons (&nbsp;<b>;</b>&nbsp;) which terminate every statement,
on lines 0011, 0013, 0014 and 0015, should be noted. Just as every
sentence which forms a paragraph in this book is terminated with
a full stop. So every statement which forms an object declaration,
or a step in a Java action must be terminated with a semicolon.
<br>

<p>
The listing, as shown above, is written in a form which a Java
developer can read and understand. However it is not yet in a
form which the computer can understand. In order to transform
it from a form which a human can understand into a from that a
computer can understand it has to be <i><b>compiled</b></i>. 
<br>

<p>
The first stage of the compilation process it to make sure that
the listing is written exactly to Java's syntax rules. If a sentence
in this book is <i>exactly written not</i> to the rules of English
a human can still, in most cases, understand its meaning, (can't
you ). Unfortunately computers cannot do this and the compiler
will not continue if it discovers a <i><b>syntax error</b></i>,
stopping at this stage with the best explanation of the errors
it has found.<br>

<p>
Even if the listing does conform to Java's syntax rules the instructions
contained in the listing may not be what are required by the program's
specification. This is analogous to an English sentence which
seems grammatically correct but which contains nonsense; for example.
&quot;T'was brillig and the slivey tove.&quot;; or &quot;When
reading this book make sure that you keep your eyes closed.&quot;.
Java will attempt to do whatever these instructions seem to mean,
even if it is nonsense, and failing to do whatever the developer
intended. Errors of this form are known as <i><b>semantic errors</b></i>.
<br>

<p>
The way in which the program listing above is entered into a computer
and compilation subsequently attempted, with syntax errors being
reported. Or, eventually when all such errors have been removed,
executing the program; differ widely from computer system to computer
system and from compiler to compiler. The first  exercises at
the end of this chapter will require these details to be discovered.
It is suggested that this exercise is attempted at this stage
before continuing with the rest of this chapter.<br>
