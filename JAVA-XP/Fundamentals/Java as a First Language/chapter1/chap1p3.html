<h2>1.3 The <i>TheAnswer</i> class<br>
</h2>

<p>
A class is designed using a <i><b>class diagram</b></i> which
can be thought of as an expansion of the rectangular boxes used
in Figure 1.1. The class diagram for the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class is given in Figure 1.2.<br>

class diagram.<br>
</center>
<p>
The diagram states that the class of objects called <i>TheAnswer</i>
provides a single action called <i>theAnswerIs</i>,
which supplies an item of data identified as <i>ultimate</i>.
A listing of the implementation of this design is as follows.
<br>

<pre>
0001  // Filename <i>TheAnswer.java</i>.
0002  // Initial Java object written for the JOF 
0003  // book chapter 1 - see text.
0004  //
0005  // Fintan Culwin, V0.1, August 1997.
0006  
0007  <b>public class</b> <i>TheAnswer</i> { 
0008  
0009     <b>public</b> String <i>theAnswerIs</i>(){ 
0010        <b>return</b> &quot;forty two&quot;;   
0011     } // End <i>theAnswerIs</i>.
0012  
0013  } // End <i>TheAnswer</i>.<br>

</pre>

<p>
Again, the first five lines of this listing are the who, what,
where, why, when, comments. The first comment identifies the name
of this file as <i>TheAnswer.java</i>,
which indicates that it should contain the declaration of the
<i>TheAnswer</i> class. Line
0007 contains the start of the class declaration, which extends
as far as the end of the file on line 0013. This class is specified
as <b>public</b> to make it visible
outside this file in order that the client class can see it.<br>

<p>
The class diagram indicates that the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class provides a single action called <i>theAnswerIs()</i>.
This action is declared within <i>TheAnswer</i>'s
declaration on lines 0009 to 0010 and is indented to emphasise
that it is contained within the class declaration.<br>

<p>
Line 0009 states that this is the <b>public</b>
declaration of an action called <i>theAnswerIs()</i>
which will supply a String value
to any client which asks for it. The <b>public</b>
modifier indicates that it is visible outside the class, String
that it returns an String value
and the empty round brackets () that it is an action requiring
no arguments. The first line of an action declaration, which states
it name, visibility modifiers, the type of value which it returns
and its arguments, is known as an action's <i><b>signature</b></i>.
The opening brace on line 0009 and the commented closing brace
on line 0011 delineate the extent of the declaration. The steps
which comprise a declaration are enclosed between the two braces
and, in this case, consist of a single <b>return</b>
statement, on line 0010. A <b>return</b>
statement is used to indicate the value which will be supplied
when the action is activated. In this action the String
value &quot;forty two&quot; will always be supplied. The semicolon
(&nbsp;<b>;</b>&nbsp;) at the end of the line terminates single
statement of the action. <br>

<p>
This completes the declaration of the <i>TheAnswer</i>
class which by itself cannot actually do anything. In order for
it to be used a client program which asks for its services has
to be produced. The provision of a suitable client program is
the responsibility of the <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
class whose design and construction will be described next.<br>
