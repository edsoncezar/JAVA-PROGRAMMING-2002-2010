Hierarchy</b></font></h1>

<p><font size="4">This part of the tutorial will complete the
implementation of the </font><font size="3" face="Arial"><i>Counters</i></font><font
size="4"> hierarchy. As this is accomplished the techniques
required for the implementation of selection and exception
handling will have to be introduced. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When any of these classes are implemented the </font><font
size="3" face="Arial"><i>count()</i></font><font size="4"> and </font><font
size="3" face="Arial"><i>unCount()</i></font><font size="4">
actions will have to be <i>overridden</i>. This introduces the
concept of a child class replacing or augmenting an existing
action of a parent class which has implicitly been introduced
previously with regard to constructors. <br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Each of these actions will also have to be
implemented by making use of selection, initially a two way
selection subsequently as a simple selection. Three, and multiple
way selections are not introduced at this stage.<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Exception handling should be regarded as a
fundamental construct, on a par with sequence, selection and
iteration and is introduced as such at this stage. Iteration is
not considered at this stage as this might imply an iterative
data structure encapsulated within the instances. (However the </font><font
size="3" face="Arial"><i>SteppingCounter</i></font><font size="4">
exercise at the end of the previous section could be used if this
were felt to be important.) </font></p>
