<p><font size="4">This part of the tutorial will describe the
process of getting started. (This is not strictly true - an
initial few weeks spent accommodating to the environment and
learning how to use the compiler by the entry of some initial
Java class files, including client/ class designs is recommended.
However time is short today &#133;). </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The first class hierarchy which is met should
be a model of a readily comprehensible real world <i>object</i>.
This would preclude hierarchies such as the </font><font size="4"
face="Arial"><em>BankAccount</em></font><font size="4"> hierarchy
which are models of objects whose real-word existence is
essentially abstract. A </font><font size="4" face="Arial"><i>ClickCounter</i>
</font><font size="4">is being modelled here - the real-world
analogue being the small hand held mechanical devices which night
club bouncers use to count the number of people entering. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">This approach is stressing the extendibility of
a class from the outset and is imparting a fundamental message of
<i>development by extension</i>. The process of developing the
hierarchy also introduces the <i>design, build, demonstrate
(test)</i> &#133; technique from the outset. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">One alternative approach might stress the <b><i>use</i></b>
of existing classes, or hierarchies, at the outset; concentrating
upon the development of client programs before considering the
construction of classes. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another alternative approach might stress
monolithic classes at the outset, moving onto development by
extension only after they have been assimilated. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Whatever approach is used there is clearly a
need for other real-world based class hierarchies to be
suggested, rather than the tired old clichés which are beginning
to permeate introductory text books. One alternative which has
been used at SBU is the (petrol)</font><font size="4"
face="Arial"><em>Pumps</em></font><font size="4"> hierarchy.</font></p>
