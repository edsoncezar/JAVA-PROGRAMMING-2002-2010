<h1>Chapter 3 summary<br>
</h1>
<h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li> Class hierarchies are used to construct a complex object in
a number of simpler stages. 
<p>
<li>   Class hierarchies make construction, debugging and maintenance
easier and encourage reuse. 
<p>
<li>   Every class in a hierarchy has only one parent class, but a
class can have any number of child classes. 
<p>
<li>   A child class is an extension of its parent and inherits all
of its parent's resources. 
<p>
<li>   Classes in a hierarchy can be abstract or non-abstract, clients
of the hierarchy can only instantiate objects from non-abstract
classes. Abstract classes are only used as the foundation of non-abstract
classes. 
<p>
<li>   All the classes in a hierarchy should be collected together
in a package of classes. 
<p>
<li>   Classes have public, private and protected resources. Private
resources are totally invisible outside the class, protected resources
are only visible to child classes and public resources are totally
visible. 
<p>
<li>   Classes are designed using a class diagram which shows the public
resources on the right, the protected resources on the left and
may show its private resources in the middle.
<p>
<li>   Classes themselves can be protected or public, only public classes
are visible outside the package.
<p>
<li>   A child class can only access the private resources of its parent
by using the protected or private actions. 
<p>
<li>   A class hierarchy should be constructed in stages by building
a class and demonstrating that it seems to work before continuing
with the next class in the hierarchy. <br>
