<b>Chapter 3 The start of the <i>Counters</i> class hierarchy
</h1>
</b>
<p>
This chapter will introduce the construction of a collection of
classes known as the <i>Counters</i> <i><b>class hierarchy</b></i>.
This collection of classes will subsequently be built upon in
the following two chapters to illustrate the development of a
class's functionality by extension. <i><b>Development by extension</b></i>
is probably the single most useful technique available to a developer
for reasons which will be explained below. <br>

<p>
Although the concept of development by extension may initially
seem very complex, it is fundamental to all that follows. Consequently
it is important that the contents of these chapters are thoroughly
assimilated before proceeding. Each chapter is divided into sections
which present one step in the production of the hierarchy, and
each section should be well understood before proceeding to the
next. Having absorbed the contents of the sections and of each
chapter the only way of ensuring that they are fully understood
is to complete the exercises presented at the end of the chapters.
