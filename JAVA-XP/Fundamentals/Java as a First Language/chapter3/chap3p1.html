<h1>3.1 Class hierarchies<br>
</h1>

<p>
In a class hierarchy the eventual complexity of a class which
will be used by a program client is built up in a number of stages.
The intention is that although the eventual class will be complex,
each of the classes from which it is built up will be relatively
simple. It is easier to build a number of small simple classes
than it would be to build a single complex class. <br>

<p>
The second major reason for building a class hierarchy is that
it is often the case that a number of closely related classes
are required. If each of these were built as a single complex
class then there would be much duplication between them. When
the related classes are implemented as a class hierarchy then
those aspects of the classes which are common can be implemented
in the supporting classes and shared between the classes required
by the clients. <br>

<p>
Using a class hierarchy makes <i><b>debugging</b></i> easier.
Software rarely works correctly when it is first compiled, and
running the program will indicate that something is wrong. With
a class hierarchy it is hoped that the symptoms will indicate
which class in the hierarchy is faulty and, as the class is relatively
simple, it should be easy to fix. <br>

<p>
The initial version of a successful application is rarely the
last version and either bugs which are not immediately apparent
will be discovered or changes and enhancements will be required.
The use of a class hierarchy will allow these <i><b>maintenance</b></i>
changes to be more easily implemented. If additional functionality
is required in an application then what is the final class in
a class hierarchy can be used as a supporting class in an extended
hierarchy whose new class, or classes, build upon the existing
hierarchy.<br>

<p>
<i><b>Reuse</b></i> is closely related to maintenance. It is often
the case that a new application shares much in common with existing
applications but differs in some respects. With a class hierarchy
it is possible that some, or most, of the existing hierarchy can
be used with the new application and only a few new classes need
to be added. This can be taken one stage further and <i><b>repositories</b></i>
of existing classes can be used as the starting point from which
the development of an application should proceed. <br>
