<h1>3.2 The <i>Counters</i> class hierarchy<br>
</h1>

<p>
The hierarchy which will be used as an initial example in this,
and the next, chapter is concerned with the implementation of
a software model of a <i>mechanical click counter</i>. These devices
consist of a digital display and two buttons. One button, the
<i>reset</i> button, resets the counter to zero; and the other
button, the <i>counting</i> button, will increment the value on
the display by one. These devices are sometimes used to count
the number of people who are entering a building or the number
of vehicles which are passing a particular point, events known
as <i><b>occurrences</b></i>.  <br>

<p>
The functionality of the hierarchy which will be developed here
extends this concept a little further, most obviously by the provision
of an <i>uncounting</i> facility which will decrement the value.
More significantly the behaviour of the counter at the limits
of its range will be modelled in three different ways. Most mechanical
counters are limited to three digits and can count from 000 to
999. If the <i>counting</i> button is pressed when the counter
is displaying 999 the value displayed will <i>roll&nbsp;over</i>
back to 000. It is also possible that pressing the counting button
at this stage might have no effect upon the display or might give
some kind of warning that the occurrence has not been counted.
<br>

<p>
The three different possibilities, known as the <i>RollOverCounter</i>
class the <i>StoppingCounter</i> class and the <i>WarningCounter</i>
class, will share two common supporting classes. The simplest
class, known as the <i>BasicCounter</i> class, will supply the
ability to count and uncount occurrences without any obvious limits
on its range. An extension to this class, known as the <i>LimitedCounter</i>
class, will place a limit upon the range of values which can be
counted. The relationships between the five classes can be illustrated
by a <i><b>class hierarchy diagram</b></i>; the diagram for the
<i>Counters</i> classes is given in Figure 3.1. <br>

<p>
The root of the hierarchy is the <i>BasicCounter</i> class and
it has a single <i>child&nbsp;class</i> called <i>LimitedCounter</i>.
Correspondingly the <i>BasicCounter</i> class is known as the
parent class of the <i>LimitedCounter</i> class. Both of these
classes are never intended to be used directly by a client program
and this is indicated by the dotted box. The three child classes
of the <i>LimitedCounter</i> class (<i>RollOverCounter</i>, <i>StoppingCounter</i>
and <i>WarningCounter</i>) are shown in solid boxes as they are
intended to be used directly by clients. <br>

<p>
All five of these classes, and any other counting classes which
might be added in the future, are collected together in a <i><b>package</b></i>
called <i>Counters</i>. This is indicated on the top left hand
corner of the diagram. This chapter will introduce the <i>BasicCounter
</i>and<i> LimitedCounter </i>classes; the following chapter will
introduce the three remaining classes. <br>
