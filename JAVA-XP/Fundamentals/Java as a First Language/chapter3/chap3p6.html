<h2>3.6 The design of the <i>LimitedCounter</i> class<br>
</h2>

<p>
The process of producing the <i>LimitedCounter</i> class follows
that used for the <i>BasicCounter</i> class. The first stage is
to produce a class diagram, from which its implementation can
be derived and then a demonstration harness used to verify that
it operates correctly. The <i>LimitedCounter</i> class introduces
into the hierarchy limits upon the range of values which the counter
can count between, although it does not enforce these limits.
<br>

<p>
The class diagram for the <i>LimitedCounter</i> class is shown
in Figure 3.4. <br>

diagram.<br>
</font></center>
<p>
This diagram indicates that the class will contain four data attributes.
The first two of these, <i>DEFAULTMINIMUM</i> and <i>DEFAULTMAXIMUM</i>,
are shown in bold boxes and the capitalisation indicates that
they are class constants. The next two data attributes, <i>minimumCount</i>
and <i>maximumCount</i> are shown in normal boxes indicating that
they are instance variables.<br>

<p>
If the first constructor, without any arguments, is used then
the range which the <i>LimitedCounter</i> will count through will
be the range of values between <i>DEFAULTMINIMUM</i> and <i>DEFAULTMAXIMUM</i>.
However if the second constructor is used then the client must
supply values for the limits of the range. In all situations the
range of values which a particular counter instance will count
between are stored in its instance variables <i>minimumCount</i>
and <i>maximumCount</i>.<br>

<p>
All six actions of this class are partially&nbsp;private and are
only intended to be used by this class's children. The first two
of these actions are the constructors which have been adequately
described above. The next two actions are <b>boolean</b> enquiry
actions which will return <b>true</b> if the number of occurrences
counted is at the minimum or maximum of its range respectively.
If the counter is not at the minimum or maximum of its range then
the actions will respectively return <b>false</b>. The last two
actions will inform a client of the value of the minimum and maximum
of the range respectively. <br>
