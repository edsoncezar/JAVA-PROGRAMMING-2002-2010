<h2>3.3 The design of the <i>BasicCounter</i> class<br>
</h2>

<p>
The intention of the <i>BasicCounter</i> class is to provide fundamental
counting behaviour to its child classes. To achieve this the class
will have to provide methods which can <i>count</i> an occurrence,
<i>uncount</i> an occurrence and inform other classes how many
occurrences it has counted. Additionally it will have to be constructed
to allow its child classes to set the number of occurrences counted
to an arbitrary value. This is summarised in the <i>BasicCounter</i>
class diagram shown in Figure 3.2.<br>

diagram.<br>

<p>
The diagram identifies the class being designed as <i>BasicCounter</i>
and it also indicates that it is an extension of the Java <b>Object</b>
class. The dotted lines used to define the limits of the class
indicate that this is an abstract class, in accord with the class
hierarchy diagram presented above.<br>

<p>
The components shown on the right of the diagram are regarded
as being <i><b>fully&nbsp;public</b></i> and can be seen, and
used, by any clients of this class. The components shown on the
left of the diagram are regarded as being <i><b>partially&nbsp;private</b></i>
and can only be seen, and used, by a defined set of clients; most
usually only those classes which are descended from this class.
Any components shown totally enclosed within the diagram are regarded
as being <i><b>totally&nbsp;private</b></i> to the class and are
the sole concern of the class being designed. It is not required
that the class is actually implemented using these private components,
they might only be shown in order to help a client developer's
understanding of the class.  <br>

<p>
The first partially private action is a constructor, identified
as such by having the same name as the class being designed. The
purpose of a constructor is to create an instance of the class
and initialise it into a well defined state. The constructor takes
a single (integer) argument shown as <i>initialCount</i>, and
will set the newly constructed object to a state where it has
counted <i>initialCount</i> occurrences.<br>

<p>
The next two partially private actions will <i>count</i> and <i>unCount</i>
an occurrence respectively. This is followed by the last partially
private action called <i>setCountTo</i> which requires a single
argument: an integer called <i>setTo</i>. This action can be used
by a child class to set the number of occurrences counted to the
value of <i>setTo</i>.<br>

<p>
The only public action is an enquiry&nbsp;action called <i>numberCountedIs</i>
which will inform a client of the current number of occurrences
counted. Public actions of a class are inherited as public actions
of all its child classes. Thus the abstract <i>LimitedCounter</i>
class on the class hierarchy diagram, and the three non-abstract
classes, will all make a public <i>numberCountedIs</i> action
available to their clients. <br>

<p>
The private component <i>counted</i> suggests to a developer reading
this diagram that the class contains a single <i>data&nbsp;attribute</i>
which is used to store the value of the number of occurrences
counted. The full reasoning for all these design decisions will
only become apparent when the entire hierarchy is reviewed at
the end of the next chapter. <br>
