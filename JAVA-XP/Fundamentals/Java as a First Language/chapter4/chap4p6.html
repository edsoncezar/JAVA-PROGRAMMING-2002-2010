<h2>4.6 The Counters hierarchy in retrospect<br>
</h2>

<p>
The designs which have been presented for the <i>Counters</i>
hierarchy are not the only set of designs which could have been
presented. One possibility might have been not to implement a
hierarchy at all but to have used three distinct classes. The
problem with this design is there would have been much duplication
between the three classes. Also, if at some stage in the future
a maintenance change is required this might mean a change in three
different classes. With the hierarchy design a change in one of
the common classes would be inherited by all three non-abstract
classes. This makes maintenance easier and ensures that all three
classes which might be used by a client are all changed simultaneously.
<br>

<p>
It would also have been more difficult to build three large classes
than to build a total of five small classes. With the hierarchy
design each class was relatively small and simple, and each class
was demonstrated to be operating correctly before additional complexity
was added to it. This method of development, known as build, test,
build, test &#133; is hoped to allow functionality to be developed
in stages with any errors being located and corrected as early
as possible. The consequences of not detecting and correcting
an error at an early stage might be an extensive redesign and
reimplementation of a large amount of code. <br>

<p>
Assuming that the arguments for the construction of a hierarchy
have been accepted, this is not the only hierarchy which could
have been constructed. One possibility might have been to make
the <i>WarningCounter</i> a child class of the <i>StoppingCounter</i>,
as a <i>WarningCounter</i> not only refuses to count beyond the
limits of its range but also throws an exception if any attempt
is made to do so. Thus a <i>WarningCounter</i> can be thought
of, and implemented as, an extended <i>StoppingCounter</i>. <br>

<p>
Whichever topology of classes is built there is still a possibility
of making more of the actions fully public. For example there
is no real reason why the <i>isAtMaximum</i> and <i>isAtMinimum</i>
actions of the <i>LimitedCounter</i> class were not declared public
and thus inherited as public actions by all its child classes.
This might allow a client program's actions to inquire if the
counter instance is at its maximum and not call the count action
if it were, thus avoiding the stopping or warning behaviour. This
was not done in this implementation as it was thought that should
this be necessary a child class could re-declare these actions
publicly and dispatch to the private actions in its implementation.
<br>

<p>
For any specification there is always a large number of possible
designs, many of which will be acceptable and each of which will
have its advantages and disadvantages. The skill of design is
to recognise these possibilities and to make the trade-offs which
minimises the complexity of the designs whilst maximising its
potential for reuse. Like any skill it is only by practising these
decisions that competence will emerge.       <br>
