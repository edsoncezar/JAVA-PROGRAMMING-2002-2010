<h1>Chapter 4 The completion of the <i>Counters</i> hierarchy
<br>
</h1>

<p>
In this chapter the class hierarchy which was introduced in Chapter
3 will be completed. Each of the three non-abstract classes the
<i>RollOverCounter</i>, <i>StoppingCounter</i> and <i>WarningCounter</i>
classes will be designed, implemented, described and demonstrated.
<br>

<p>

In order to implement actions in all three of these classes a
mechanism for a Java program to make a decision will have to be
introduced. For example, in the <i>RollOver</i> class the <i>count</i>
action will have to decide between simply counting an occurrence,
if the counter is not at the maximum of its range, and resetting
it to the minimum of its range, if it is at its maximum. This
ability of a program fragment to make a decision is known as a
<i><b>selection</b></i> and is fundamental to constructing programs
with seemingly intelligent behaviour.<br>

<p>
This also implies that the <i>RollOver</i> class will have to
define its own <i>count</i> action which will replace the <i>count</i>
action inherited from the <i>BasicCounter</i> class. This is known
as action <i><b>overriding</b></i> and is an essential part of
development by extension. <br>

<p>
The brief description of the <i>WarningClass</i> in Chapter 3
stated that it would issue a warning if an attempt were made to
count above or below its range. The mechanism to issue such a
warning is known as <i><b>throwing an exception</b></i>, and is
a necessarry technique to the production of very robust software
artefacts.<br>
