<h1>Chapter 5 The <i>RoomMonitor</i> class and <i>MoneyRegister</i>
hierarchy<br>
</h1>

<p>
This chapter will continue the consideration of development by
extension by introducing  new classes which further extend the
<i>Counters</i> hierarchy. There are relatively few additional
concepts introduced in this chapter and it is intended to provide
an opportunity for the many concepts which have been presented
in the previous chapters to be consolidated. Accordingly there
are a larger number of end of chapter exercises for the skills
to be practised and consolidated.<br>

<p>
The first class which will be presented in this chapter is called
the <i>RoomMonitor</i> class, although this name is somewhat misleading.
It is intended to provide a class which can monitor the number
of number of people who are entering and leaving a building. Although
it could just as easily be used for monitoring the number of vehicles
entering and leaving a stretch of road, or other similar patterns
of occurrences. In order to allow for some design considerations
to be explained it will be implemented in two different manners
and the advantages and disadvantages of each design approach will
be discussed.<br>

<p>
A separate extension to the <i>Counters</i> hierarchy will start
by introducing a simple <i>MoneyRegister</i> class which in addition
to counting the number of transactions will also record the amount
of money taken into the register. This class will be extended
to provide a <i>MultipleRegister</i>, which will be able to maintain
separate totals for the amount taken by cash, by cheque, by debit
card and by credit card. The chapter will end with a review of
the process of development by extension.<br>
