<h2>5.8 Development by extension<br>
</h2>

<p>
Chapters three, four and five have introduced the design and implementation
of a class hierarchy using a build, test, build, test &#133; technique.
These classes will be (re)used in the following chapters to illustrate
other aspects of Java and software development. It would thus
be very appropriate at this point to review and revisit the contents
of all five initial chapters, before proceeding.<br>

<p>
A whistle stop summary of the important points from these chapters
might be that in order to deal with the complexity of software
artefacts they are built up a stage at a time, each stage adding
a small amount of functionality. In order to use the functionality
any class can extend an existing class in which case it has an
<i><b>is&nbsp;a</b></i> relationship with it. Alternatively it
can encapsulate an instance of the class in which case it has
a <i><b>has&nbsp;a</b></i> relationship with it. The remaining
possibility is that it has neither an is&nbsp;a nor a has&nbsp;a
relationship in which case it merely <i><b>uses</b></i> an instance
of the other class. For example, the program clients do not extend
or encapsulate an existing class by declare an instance of them
for their own use.  
<p>
In a Java class hierarchy a class can only have one parent class,
although a parent class can have any number of child classes.
Within the hierarchy a class can be either public or private and
can be abstract or non-abstract. Each action or data attribute
in the class can be either private, partially private or public
and additionally can be class-wide or associated with an instance.
Data attributes may also be declared as constants but only in
a class-wide manner.<br>

<p>
A class can extend its parent class by the addition of new actions
or the overriding of existing actions to make them more specialised.
However it cannot remove actions which, should it be necessary,
would suggest a <i><b>has&nbsp;a</b></i> rather than an <i><b>is&nbsp;a</b></i>
relationship.<br>
