Hexadecimal numbers

<h3>
<ul>
The symbol '12' means one set of 10 plus 2, which is twelve.
<p>

The symbol '78' means seven sets of 10 plus 8, which is seventy eight.
<p>

The symbol '240' means two sets of 100 plus 4 sets of 10 plus 0,<br> which is two hundred and forty.
</ul>
<p>

This is because humans have ten fingers (and thumbs), so we count in a base of ten. If we had 
sixteen fingers (and thumbs) we would probably count in a base of sixteen. So the symbol '16' 
would mean one set of sixteen plus zero, which is sixteen.  
<p>
If this were the case then we would have to invent symbols for the digits ten, 
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen and fifteen.
