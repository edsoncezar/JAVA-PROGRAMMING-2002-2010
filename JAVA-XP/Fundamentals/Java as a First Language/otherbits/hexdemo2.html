<h1 align=center>Other number bases </h1>

<h3>In addition to decimal (base 10) and hexadecimal (base 16), 
values can be expressed in any other base. Common bases used in 
computing include binary (base 2) and octal (base 8).
 
<ul>
<p>The binary number 11 is one set of two plus one, which is three.</p>
<P>

<p>The octal number 11 is one set of eight plus one, which is nine.</p>
<P>

<p>The decimal number 11 is one set of ten plus one, which is eleven.</p>
<P>

<p>The hexadecimal number 11 is one set of sixteen plus one, which is seventeen.</p>

The calculator on the left allows you to enter and convert 
between different bases. You can enter values into the display 
at the top by using the buttons below the display. 
<P>
The option buttons at the bottom allow you to select a base.

<p>What digit symbols can you use to enter a binary value? </p>
<p>What digit symbols can you use to enter an octal value? </p>

<p>What digit symbols can you use to enter a hexadecimal value? </p>

<p>What is the binary, octal and hexadecimal representations of the decimal value 16? </p>

<p>What is the relationship between the number of binary digits and hexdecimal digits?
<UL>
(Hint: start by entering a single 1 in binary and then converting to hex. Convert back to 
decimal and add another 1, continue in this way until you have spotted the relationship.)
