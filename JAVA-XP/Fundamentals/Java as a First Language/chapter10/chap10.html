<h1>Chapter 10 The <i>JulianDate</i> hierarchy<br>
</h1>

<p>
This chapter will describe the design and implementation
of a class to illustrate and consolidate the processes of designing
a class hierarchy for a complex requirement. The examples which
have been used previously have either been very simple in their
requirements or artificially specified in order to be straightforward.
The intention here is to provide an opportunity to examine a class
which has been produced to professional standards and as a part
of this to consider internationalisation issues. The hierarchy
will also be used extensively in the subsequent chapters.<br>

<p>
Many areas of activity have a requirement to represent
calendar dates and to manipulate them, for example to determine
the number of days between two dates. This requirement was first
articulated by a 16<sup>th</sup> century French scholar called
Joseph Scaliger. Within astronomy it is necessary to be absolutely
precise about the meaning of a date, the relationships between
different dates and how many days there are between two given
dates. Scaliger proposed a concept, which he called <i><b>Julian&nbsp;dates</b></i>,
where days were numbered sequentially from day 1. Day 1 was arbitrarily
defined as 1st January 4713 BCE, and subsequent days are numbered from
then. Joseph Scaliger named the concept Julian&nbsp;days in honour
of his father Julius Caeser Scaliger. It has no other connection
with Julius Caesar, nor with the calendar reforms which he instituted.
<br>

<p>
The requirement can thus be loosely stated as a need
to provide a <i>JulianDate</i> class which will store, represent
and manipulate calendar dates in Julian dates format. In the interests
of manageable simplicity this implementation will restrict the
range of dates to 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Jan&nbsp;1900 to 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;2199
(109573 days), which should be sufficient for the life span of
any programs which make use of the hierarchy. In order to be developed
further this vague statement of requirements will have to be refined
into a precise specification of which operations are to be provided.
For any class one way to assist the precise definition of operations
for the type is to consider possible operations from the following
categories.<br>

<ul>
<li>actions to construct an instance of the class.
<p>
<li>actions to inquire of the instances' attributes.
<p>
 <li>actions to set the value of an instances' attributes
<p>
  <li>relational, arithmetic or pseudo-arithmetic operations.
<p>
  <li>input and output actions.
<p>
  <li>other actions which are specific to the class.
</ul>
<br>
