<H1>Pedagogic criteria</H1><BR>

<P>
This part of the activity asked the attendees to
nominate, and subsequently evaluate the importance of, various
criteria to evaluate a language's pedagogic suitability against.
The table shows in the first column the name of the criteria,
linked to a more complete explanation. The following columns are
the number of responses received and the average score, in the
range 0 to 5, where 0 indicates irrelevance and 5 that it is of
overwhelming importance. The final column is the standard deviation
indicating the degree of consensus with smaller values indicating
closer agreement.<BR>

<P>
One criteria from the workshop has been split into
two criteria on this table. The criteria <I>hybrid</I> indicates
a hybrid language, that is one which actively supports both procedural/&nbsp;imperative
and object&nbsp;oriented styles of development. The criteria <I>pure</I>
indicates a language which only actively supports an object&nbsp;oriented
development style. During the workshop these were presented as
a single construct with a negative score indicating purity. This
seems to have confused many of the attendees (<I>sorry!)</I> and
thus fewer responses were made, although a number of attendees
indicated that they thought the criteria to be irrelevant.<BR>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=stabi>
<B>stability &amp; standard</B>
refers both to the existence of an ANSI and/&nbsp;or ISO standard
for the language and the degree to which the language is not subject
to change.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=stron>
<B>strong typing</B>
is the extent to, at compile time and at run
time, only actions appropriate to an object are applied to it.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=simpl>
<B>simplicity</B> is a combination
of the syntax's simplicity, regularity and brevity.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=pedag>
<B>pedagogic support</B>
is the availability and quality of resources to support the language's
use within the curriculum.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=cross>
<B>cross curriculum</B>
refers to the language's suitability for use in all areas of the
curriculum as opposed to its suitability for use as first/&nbsp;base
language.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=cost>
<B>cost</B>
refers to the costs involved in using the language, both for students
and for the institution.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=learn>
<B>learning curve</B>
refers to the initial learning curve for the language specifically,
but not exclusively, the amount of syntactic overhead involved
in producing an initial artifact.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=safet>
<B>safety</B> refers to the avoidance
of gotchas. That is (syntactic) constructs in the language which
will impede a student developing a clear conceptual model of its
operation. (The archetype for this must be the confusion between
= and == in C/&nbsp;C++ control expressions.)<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=marke>
<B>marketability</B> refers to
the initial commercial value of student's experience with the
language.<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=hybri>
<B>hybrid and pure</B> refer,
as explained above, to the extent to which the language does (hybrid)
or does not (pure) support styles of development other than OO.
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=fun>
<B>fun</B> (I am not sure what
this means, apparently students in the USA are expected to enjoy
the experience of learning software development!)<BR>

<P>
<A NAME=conce>
<B>conceptual expressability</B>
refers to the simplicity and regularity of the cognitive connnections
between a language's syntax and semantics.<BR>
