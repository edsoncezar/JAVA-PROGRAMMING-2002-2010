<H2>Notes</H2><P>
JDK is admittedly not an IDE but a command line environment.
<P>
The popularity of Symantec Cafe might be as a result of its free distribution 
with the Core Java book, which was reported as being the most popular 
<A HREF="books.html" tppabs="http://www.scism.sbu.ac.uk/jfl/sanjose/books.html">book resource</A>.
<P>
The low number of attendees voting for any of these resources, especially the JDK, 
brings into question the amount of personal practical experience of Java which the 
attendees had had.
