<P>
These pages contain the results of the Java in the C.S. Curriculum workshop held 
at the 27th ACM SIGCSE Conference. I have tried to report the discussions and 
conclusions of the workshop, to the best of me recollection, without putting my 
personal interpretation onto the data. Should you feel that I have failed in this 
aspect please e-mail me and I will attempt to take account of your objection.

My personal executive summary of this information would be that Java was evaluated 
by the attendees as the most favored language and C++ as the least favored. 
<P>
However two caveats should be borne in mind. Firstly this report is based upon a 
return of approximately 75 questionnaires from approximately 150 people who attended 
the workshop, out of a conference attendance in excess of 700. Thus this is a self 
selected sample, however by reason of their self-selection they may be the most 
interested and influential upon the evolution of software development education.
<P>
The second caveat is that, for the most part, the respondents have had minimal 
experience of using Java in the classroom and in many cases seem ill-informed 
concerning the resources available to support Java in the classroom. 
<P>
What can be concluded from the results is that there is a very significant 
interest in the potential for Java in C.S. and S.E. education and that this 
interest will be increasingly translated into practical experience. It also 
indicates that there is a need for further training, education and evaluation 
of Java for software development educators.
<P>
The results also indicate a deep seated dissatisfaction with C++ as an educational 
language which belies its popularity in surveys of first and base language use. If 
nothing else Java may be adopted by many institutions as a better C++.
<P>
Finally, many thanks to Maria Bottono (who may now be able to find her name 
in a Web search) for acting as recorder during the workshop and 
assisting in processing the data.
