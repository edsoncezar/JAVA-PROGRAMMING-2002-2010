<h1>The features table</h1>

<p>
The features table from the workshop is given below.
For those who were present: a cross has been coded as 0, a bracketed
cross as 1, a bracketed tick as 2, a tick as 3 and a tick&nbsp;plus
as 4. <br>

<p>
The IDE feature has been removed from the table as
the outcome indicated that a relatively low cost environment was
available for every language.<br>

<p>
In the notes which follow the table I have largely
resisted the temptation to add any comments which were not made
by attendees. Where I have succumbed my comments are indicated
in curly braces {}.<br>

<p>
<a NAME="STATIC">
Static type checking refers to the ability of the environment
to determine that the actual parameter supplied is incompatible
with the data type of the formal parameter. <br>

<p>
<a NAME="PURITY">
Purity refers to the strength of the object model within the environment.
Java obtained a 2 as although a main() action cannot exist outside
a class (object) definition, the class definition need only be
a token wrapper.<br>

<p>
<a NAME="MULTIPLE">
Multiple inheritance refers to the ability to define a new class
as an extension of more than one parent class, inheriting data
attributes and actions from all. {On reflection Ada 95 and Java
should have got at least 1 as there are techniques by which the
beneficial aspects of multiple inheritance can be implemented
without the detrimental aspects. In Java this is syntactically
light weight, in Ada 95 it is heavy weight}.<br>

<p>
<a NAME="LANGUAGE">
Language standard refers to the availability of a written definition
of the language's syntax and semantics. Only Ada '95 has an ANSI/&nbsp;ISO
standard, {so it should have got a 4}.<br>

<p>
<a NAME="LEXICAL">
Lexical complexity was operationally defined as the ease with
which a non-trivial program, for example more complex than hello&nbsp;world,
can be implemented. <br>

<p>
<a NAME="GENERICS">
Generics refers to the ability to separate an algorithm from the
data type which it will operate upon. For example a generic sort
algorithm can be instantiated to sort a list of integers, or floats,
or strings or any other data type. <br>

<p>
<a NAME="OPERATOR">
Operator overload refers to the ability of the developer to provide
additional meanings of common operators and to use them in infix
notation. For example a developer declared data type called foo
may have an addition operator defined for it, allowing the developer
to write foo3 := foo1 + foo2.<br>

<p>
<a NAME="ASSERTIONS">
Assertions refers to the ability of the language to make logical
statements about the semantics of an action and to enforce them.
For example an action to compute a square root may have a pre-assertion
that the number whose square root is to be computed must be greater
than or equal to zero, and that the computed value times itself
must be approximately equal to the value whose square root is
required.<br>


<p>
<a NAME="EXCEPTION">
Exceptions refers to the ability of the language to interrupt
the expected flow of control in response to some occurrence. This
may be an implicit occurrence (for example dividing by zero) or
an explicit occurrence (for example two input values being incompatible).
The interruption in the flow of control is indicated by the throwing
of an exception which will propagate up the call stack looking
for a suitable exception handler. The advantage of this facility
is to separate the code which handles exceptional conditions from
that which implements the routine processing.<br>
