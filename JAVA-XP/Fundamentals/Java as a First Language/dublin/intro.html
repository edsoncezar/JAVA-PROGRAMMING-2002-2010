The aim of this workshop is to attempt to evaluate the suitability
of Java as a first programming language for computer studies/
computer science/ software engineering students.<br>

<p>
To assist in this process the following class hierarchy will be
presented and implemented in C++, Ada '95 and Java. This will
allow attendees to make a comparative evaluation of the syntactic
features of the languages. Syntax gives an indication of what
can be said, what is difficult to say and what is impossible to
say in a language and this, in turn, gives an insight into the
language's philosophy.<br>

Following the presentation of the implementations attendees will
be invited to assist in the completion of the following tables.
<br>

<p>
The first table will be used to establish the features, desirable
or undesirable, of each language. <br>

<p>
Although the prepared presentation will
be limited to the three languages named above, which are within
the workshop leader's knowledge and skills, it is hoped that other
OO languages will be suggested by attendees for inclusion.<br>

<p>
Following the completion of the feature table, criteria for the
evaluation of the languages with regard to their suitability for
use as a first language will be decided upon for the following
table.<br>

<p>

<p>
Each attendee will then be asked to individually decide their
own weightings for each criterion, to score each language against
each criterion; and to hand in their evaluations.<br>

<p>
Following the workshop the weightings and scores will be combined
to produce an overall evaluative conclusion, and (hopefully) made
available before the end of the conference.<br>

<p>
In addition each attendee will be asked on their evaluation sheet
to vote, or abstain, on a choice of language and given an opportunity
to comment upon why they have made that choice. These results
will also be summarized. <br>
