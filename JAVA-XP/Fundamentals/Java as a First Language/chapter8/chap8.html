<h1>Chapter 8 Concurrent processes<br>
</h1>

<p>
All of the programs presented so far have had a single <i><b>thread</b></i>
of control running through them. However, many applications require
two or more threads of control to be used. Such programs give
the impression that the computer is able to do more than one thing
at a time. For example a word processor might be responding to
the user's input on one thread, whilst printing on a second thread
and checking the spelling on a third. <br>

<p>
When more than one thread is being used in a program the threads
are executing concurrently and are known as <i><b>concurrent processes</b></i>.
Multi-threaded programs can allow more effective use of a computer's
resources but require greater effort on the part of the developer
to produce them. This chapter will provide an initial introduction
to the design and implementation of concurrent programs, but will
not attempt to provide a complete introduction to this very specialised
topic. <br>
