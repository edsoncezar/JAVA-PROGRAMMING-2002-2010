<h2>Exercises for Chapter 8<br>
</h2>
<h3>
<ul>
<p>
8.1 It was asserted that the faults in the <i><font FACE="Arial">Dangerous</font></i>
client were caused by two different interruptions. Show that this
is the case by implementing each <b><font FACE="Arial">synchroniz</font></b>ation
in turn.<br>

<p>
8.2 The correct operation of a <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficLight</font></i>
instance depends upon its <i><font FACE="Arial">setOtherLight</font></i>()
action being called before its <i><font FACE="Arial">run</font></i>()
action, however it does not enforce this consideration. Re-implement
the <i><font FACE="Arial">run</font></i>() action to throw
an exception if <i><font FACE="Arial">theOtherLight</font></i>
instance attribute has not been initialised. Adapt the <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficDemo</font></i>
client to show the <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficLight</font></i>
class is now implemented in a secure manner. <br>

<p>
8.3 Adapt the <i><font FACE="Arial">holdOn</font></i>()
action to give a different delay depending upon the colour of
the light in order to make the simulation more realistic. <br>

<p>
8.4 Attempt to demonstrate that a single Java statement can be
interrupted. To do this implement a <i><font FACE="Arial">DangerousWriter</font></i>
class which either sets or clears all of its bits in an <b><font FACE="Arial">long</font></b>
attribute in a single action. The action can be shown to be dangerous
if the value read from the class is not equal to the hexadecimal
values 0x00000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF. <br>

<p>
Hint: if the value of the integer attribute, called <i><font FACE="Arial">dangerousInteger</font></i>,
is 0 then all bits are currently clear and can be set by adding
0xFFFFFFFF, adding this a second time will clear all bits. More
details can be found in Appendix A1.<br>

<p>
8.5 Design and implement a <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficMonitor</font></i>
class which uses a random number generator to indicate if any
traffic is waiting and if traffic is still flowing. Associate
a <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficMonitor</font></i> instance
with each <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficLight</font></i>
instance. Adapt the <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficLight</font></i>
class so that, when it is on <i>green</i>, it will continually
ask its <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficMonitor</font></i>
if traffic is still flowing and relinquish control as soon as
none is flowing. Demonstrate the effectiveness of the revision
using an unchanged <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficDemo</font></i>
client.<br>

<p>
8.6 Further extend the <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficLight</font></i>
class from exercise 8.5 so that whilst it is on <i>green</i> it
asks its own <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficMonitor</font></i>
for its traffic flow and asks the other <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficLight</font></i>
for its traffic waiting. It should relinquish control as soon
as its traffic flow is significantly lower than the traffic waiting
at the other light. Demonstrate the effectiveness of the revision
using an unchanged <i><font FACE="Arial">TrafficDemo</font></i>
client.
