<h2>Chapter 8 summary<br>
</h2>

<h3>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent processes contain two, or more, independently executing
threads.
<p>
<li>The Java <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Thread</font> class can
be extended to implement an application specific thread.
<p>

<li>When a <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Thread</font>'s <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">start</font>()
action is called it causes the instance's <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">run</font>()
action to be started in a concurrent manner. 
<p>
<li>Actions, or parts of actions, can be made &quot;thread safe&quot;
by declaring them as <b><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">synchronized</font></b>

<p>
<li>A running <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Thread</font> can be temporarily
stopped by calling its <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">suspend</font>()
action and restarted by calling its <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">resume</font>()
action.
<p>
<li>A <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Thread</font> can be suspended
for a period of time by calling its <font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">sleep</font>()
action.
<p>
<li>Two or more threads can co-ordinate their actions by suspending
and resuming each other.
<p>
<li>Concurrent programs require much more care in their design
than non-concurrent programs and are subject to a number of very
elusive bugs.
</ul>
