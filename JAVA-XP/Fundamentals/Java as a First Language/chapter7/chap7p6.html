<h2>7.6 Menu driven user interfaces<br>
</h2>

<p>
The adapting menu driven user interface as presented in the previous
section is not the only interface which could have been provided
for this application and is capable of some improvements. The
first point to note is that it does not implement the user interface
design principle of <i><b>closure</b></i>. Whenever the user indicates
that a person has entered or left the room there is no confirmation
from the system that the action has been effected. This problem
could be solved by including a confirmation message inside each
of the relevant dispatch options. Providing closure in this manner
is essential for novice users and does not impact too much upon
the experience of more skilled users. <br>

<p>
One other problem with this interface is that when admitting people
into the room the user will be repeatedly selecting option <i><b>a</b></i>
from the menu, until the room becomes full. At this point pressing
<i><b>a</b></i> will indicate that a person has left the room.
It is predictable that some users, under some circumstances, will
not notice that the menu options have changed and continue pressing
<i><b>a</b></i> in the belief that they are recording people entering
the room. What will actually be happening is that pressing <i><b>a</b></i>
will be alternatively indicating that a person has entered the
room and that a person has left the room. <br>

<p>
One solution to this problem might be not to use an adapting menu
at all and to offer all four options at all times. However, this
would then require an error dialogue when the room becomes full
and the user attempts to admit another person, for example:<br>

<hr>
<ul><pre>
Please enter your choice : <u><i><b>a</b></i></u>
As the room is full, no more people can be admitted.

<i>{menu re-presented}</i>
</pre></ul>
<hr>
<p>
It is predictable that this solution would cause exactly the same
problem to occur under the same circumstances. The user might
not attend to the dialogue and continue pressing <i><b>a</b></i>
in the belief that they are admitting people into the room, whereas
they are actually causing the error dialog to be continually represented.
A similar pattern of error dialogs would be required for the other
menu options, apart from the show status option which is always
available.<br>

<p>
There are no simple and obvious solutions to user interface problems
such as this. Each individual developer will favour one or other
of the two possibilities presented above. The only way to decide
which interface is 'better' is to construct both interfaces and
investigate the behaviour of a representative sample of the people
who will actually use the application. Deciding which interface
is 'better' on the basis of objective measurements, such as the
number of errors made, and subjective measurements such as the
sample users comments, is preferable to relying upon the developer's
idiosyncratic judgement.<br>
