<h1>Chapter 7 The <i>AdaptingMenu</i> class<br>
</h1>

<p>
This chapter will extend the <i>BasicMenu</i> class, presented
in the previous chapter, to produce the <i>AdaptingMenu</i> class.
An adapting menu introduces the possibility of parts of the menu
being made unavailable to the user under certain conditions, a
frequent occurrence in user interface design. <br>

<p>
For example, a menu to control an application which makes use
of the <i>RoomMonitor</i> class may contain options to record
a person entering the room, record a person leaving the room,
to show the state of the monitor and to exit from the program.
All four of these options may be present on a menu, but the option
to record a person leaving the room should not be made available
until at least one person has entered the room. Likewise the option
to exit from the program should not be available unless there
are no people in the room. <br>

<p>
The reason for introducing this class at this stage in the book
is to consolidate the understanding of iterative data structures
which were introduced in the previous chapter. Consequently there
are no major new concepts introduced. <br>
