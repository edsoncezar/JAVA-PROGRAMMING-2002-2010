<h1>2.3 The start of the demonstration client<br>
</h1>

<p>
Before continuing with the description of the implementation of
the remaining <i>Friend</i> actions
the first part of a demonstration client for it, and its output,
will be presented. As with the <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
class from the previous chapter the only purpose of the <i>FriendDemo
</i>class is to supply a client program so that the actions of
the <i>Friend</i> class can be
demonstrated. The class diagram for the <i>FriendDemo
</i>class would not differ significantly from that of the <i>UltimateAnswer</i>
class and will not be presented here. <br>

<p>
The <i>main()</i> client program
action in this class is significantly more complex than the previous
<i>main()</i> action. The first
major difference is that in order to demonstrate and explain the
nature of instance attributes and actions, two instances of the
<i>Friend</i> class will be required.
The instance diagram for this program is shown in Figure 2.2.

Figure 2.2. Instance diagram for the <i>FriendDemo</i>
program<br>
</center>
<p>
The diagram shows that the client program of the <i>FriendDemo</i>
class will make use of two instances of the <i>Friend</i>
class, called <i>myFriend</i>
and <i>myOtherFriend</i>. The
high level design of the <i>main()</i>
action is as follows. <br>

<p>
The title on this design indicates that it is the first of a series
of designs for the <i>FriendDemo </i>(&nbsp;FD1&nbsp;) and that
it describes the <i>main()</i>
program action. The design indicates that the program is a sequence
of four steps concerned with showing the program title, demonstrating
the instance enquiry actions, demonstrating the birthday action
and demonstrating the class wide actions. Each of the latter three
of these steps is sufficiently complex to require its own design
and these have been cross-referenced to this design as FD2 to
4. A partial design of the <i>demonstrate&nbsp;instance&nbsp;enquiries
</i>design stage is as follows. <br>

<p>
The design indicates that the first part of demonstrating the
instance enquiry actions is to demonstrate the <i>friendsNameIs()</i>
action. To do this it is first demonstrated with the <i>myFriend</i>
instance and then demonstrated with the <i>myOtherFriend</i>
instance. Each of these demonstrations consists of showing a message,
then showing the name which involves a call of the <i>friendsNameIs()</i>
action and finally terminating the line of output on the screen.
The implementation of the <i>FriendDemo</i>
class as far as the end of this design fragment is as follows.

0021        System.out.print(   <i>myFriend.friendsNameIs</i>());             
0022        System.out.println( &quot;.&quot;);
0023       
0024  
0025        System.out.print(   &quot;\nIllustrating the friendsNameIs() &quot;);
0026        System.out.println( &quot;action of the myOtherFriend instance.&quot;);
0027        System.out.print(   &quot;The name should be Ford Prefect ... &quot;);    
0028        System.out.print(   <i>myOtherFriend.friendsNameIs</i>());             
0029        System.out.println( &quot;.&quot;);<br>

</pre>

<p>
The first five lines of the listing are the expected header comments
and are followed by the <b>import</b>ation
of the <i>Friend</i> class on
line 0007 before the required signature of the <i>main()</i>
action on line 0011 is declared. On lines 0013 and 0014 two instances
of the <i>Friend</i> class, called
<i>myFriend</i> and <i>myOtherFriend</i>
are declared and constructed. The first term on each line, e.g.
<i>Friend myFriend</i>, declares
a variable which can designate an instance of the <i>Friend</i>
class, but does not actually construct an instance of the class.
This is accomplished by the remainder of the line, e.g. =
<b>new</b> <i>Friend</i>(&nbsp;&quot;ArthurDent&quot;, 35),
which is a call of the constructor indicating that the name to
be associated with this instance is <i>Arthur&nbsp;Dent</i>
and that he is 35 years old. The second instance, <i>myOtherFriend</i>,
is constructed with the details of <i>Ford&nbsp;Prefect</i>
who is 45 years old.<br>

<p>
Line 0016 implements the design stage <i>show&nbsp;program&nbsp;title</i>,
using the System.out.println()
action. The string argument which is supplied to this action contains
a number of <i><b>formatting&nbsp;codes</b></i> which are included
to make the output more acceptable to the user. Formatting codes
consist of a slash (&nbsp;\&nbsp;) followed by a single letter
code, the <b>\n</b> code means output a <i>newline</i> at this
point and the <b>\t</b> code means output a <i>tab</i>. So the
argument to println() will be
output as a newline, two tabs<i>, This is the Friend Demo Client</i>
and a newline. This will be followed by an additional newline
as the println() action is being
used and the output will appear to the user as follows.  <br>

<p>
<hr>

<pre>
		This is the Friend Demo Client
</pre>

<hr>
<p>
<p>
Lines 0018 to 0022 implement the <i>demonstrate with myFriend</i>
part of the <i>demonstrate friendsNameIs</i> design stage. Lines
0018 to 0020 implement the <i>show&nbsp;message</i> part of the
design, indicating to the user what is happening and what should
be seen next. Line 0021 implements the <i>show&nbsp;name</i> design
stage by using the System.out.print()
action which will output the String
value returned from the <i>friendsNameIs()</i>
action of the <i>myFriend</i>
instance. The System.out.println()
call on line 0022 completes this line of screen output by terminating
it with a full stop.<br>

<p>
If everything is working correctly then the constructor should
have stored the name &quot;Arthur Dent&quot; in the <i>myFriend</i>
instance, which should be returned by its <i>friendsNameIs()</i>
action and output to the screen. The output produced by this client
as far as this point in the listing is as follows. <br>
<p>
<hr>


<pre>
		This is the Friend Demo Client


Illustrating the friendsNameIs() action of the myFriend instance.
The name should be Arthur Dent ... Arthur Dent.
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
This seems to indicate that, so far, everything seems to be working
correctly. Lines 0025 to 0029 are essentially identical to lines
0018 to 0022, but use the <i>friendsNameIs()</i>
action of the <i>myOtherFriend</i>
instance. This should retrieve and output the name &quot;Ford
Prefect&quot;; the output from this part of the client indicated
that it did so.<br>
<p>
<hr>

<pre>
Illustrating the friendsNameIs() action of the myOtherFriend instance.
The name should be Ford Prefect ... Ford Prefect.
</pre>

<hr>

<p>
Taken together these two demonstrations indicate that each instance
of the <i>Friend</i> class has
its own <i>friendsName</i> attribute
which is distinct from any <i>friendsName</i>
attribute associated with any other instance of the class. <br>
