<h1>Chapter 2. An overview of classes.<br>
</h1>

<p>
This chapter will continue the introduction to classes by developing
and explaining a second, rather trivial, application which is
intended to present and explain the concepts of <i><b>data attributes</b></i>,
<i><b>class wide actions</b></i>, <i><b>instance actions</b></i>,
<i><b>class constants</b></i> and <i><b>constructors</b></i>,
which were mentioned or briefly introduced in Chapter 1. The application
is described as trivial only in the sense that it does not do
anything useful, its conceptual understanding is anything but
trivial. <br>

<p>
The classes presented in the previous chapter contained only a
single action which always returned the same information. By adding
<i><b>data&nbsp;attributes</b></i> to a class declaration it is
possible for each instance to maintain information about its own
state and to change this information as its actions are used.
The <i><font SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">main()</font></i> action from
the client class in Chapter 1 was described as a <i><b>class&nbsp;wide</b></i>
action, which means that it is associated with the entire class
and can be used without having first to declare an instance of
the class. The alternative possibility is to have <i><b>instance&nbsp;actions</b></i>
where the action can only be used by first declaring an instance
of the class. <br>

<p>
The distinction between class wide and instance actions is related
to the distinction between <i><b>class wide data</b></i> <i><b>attributes</b></i>
and <i><b>instance data attributes</b></i>. There is only one
copy of a class wide attribute for the entire class, and it can
be accessed by any instance or class wide action. Instance attributes
have one copy per instance of the class and can only be accessed
by instance actions. A class wide attribute can also be declared
to have a constant value, in which case it is known as a <i><b>class&nbsp;constant</b></i>,
and unlike a class or instance variable attribute its value cannot
be changed by any actions.<br>

<p>
All the advice which was given at the start of Chapter 1 concerning
how to approach that chapter can be repeated for this chapter.
A full understanding of the concepts in this chapter is unlikely
to be obtained when it is followed for the first time. It will
take time and effort to assimilate and accommodate these concepts.
It will also be of benefit to revisit this chapter after Chapter
3 has been completed, in order to consolidate the initial understanding.
