<h2><h1>2.1 The design of the <i>Friend</i> class</h1><br>
</h2>

<p>
In order to give a practical introduction to these concepts, a
class whose major purpose is to illustrate their properties will
be designed, developed and described. An associated client program
will then illustrate the concepts by using its actions. The class
is intended to store and manipulate details of a <i>Friend</i>,
its class diagram is shown in Figure 2.1.<br>

Figure 2.1. The <i>Friend</i> class diagram.
</center>
<p>
This class diagram differs from the diagrams given in the previous
chapter not only by having more actions, but also by giving some
indication of its internal structure and by indicating, at the
top, that it is an extension of the Java Object
class. The purpose of a class diagram is firstly to assist a developer
with the design of the class and, secondly, to inform a developer
wanting to use the class of the actions, and other resources,
which it makes publicly available. <br>

<p>
Any parts of the design which are shown on the right are considered
fully public and can be used by any client of the class. Any parts
which are fully contained within the diagram are fully private
and are the sole concern of the class. They need not be shown
and, in some circumstances, the implementation of the class need
not actually use them. They are only present in the final version
of the class diagram to assist with its understanding.<br>

<p>
On this diagram there are four private attributes and as they
have single lined boxes and are expressed with noun phrases, they
are assumed to be data attributes. The first two, shown in normal
lined boxes, are instance variable attributes named <i>friendsName
</i>and<i> friendsAge.</i> The
last two, shown in heavy lined boxes, are class wide attributes
named <i>numberOfFriends </i>and<i>
PERSONAL_GREETING</i>. The use
of capitalisation indicates that the last of these attributes
is a constant attribute, the others are variable. <br>

<p>
The first action on the design is called <i>Friend(),</i>
which is also the name of the class. This indicates that it is
a <i><b>constructor </b></i>for the class. The purpose of a constructor
is to place the class instance into a well defined initial state
when it is created; this usually involves setting the values of
some, or all, of the instance data attributes. There are two instance
data attributes in this design and the <i>theirName
</i>and<i> theirAge</i> data
flows into the constructor indicate that the value of the attributes
will be specified by these arguments when the constructor is used.
<br>

<p>
The next two actions contain verb phrases which end in the term
<i>Is</i> which, by the convention
used in this book, indicates that they are <i><b>enquiry&nbsp;actions</b></i>
retrieving the value of a private data attribute on behalf of
a client. The <i>friendsNameIs()</i>
action will return the name of the friend and the <i>friendsAgeIs()</i>
their age, as shown by the data flow originating from the action.
The remaining instance action is the <i>birthday()</i>
action which requires no arguments and supplies no data. It purpose
is to record the birthday of a friend by increasing the <i>friendsAge</i>
instance attribute by 1.<br>

<p>
The next action, <i>numberOfFriendsIs(),</i>
is also an enquiry action returning the value of the class wide
data attribute <i>numberOfFriends</i>
. Likewise the last action <i>greetingIs()</i>
returns the personal greeting to be used when addressing a friend,
stored in the class wide constant <i>PERSONAL_GREETING</i>.
As these two actions are class wide, as opposed to instance, actions,
they are shown in heavy lined boxes. <br>
