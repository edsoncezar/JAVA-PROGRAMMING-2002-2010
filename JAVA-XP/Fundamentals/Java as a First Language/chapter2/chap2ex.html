<h1>Exercises for Chapter 2<br>
</h1>

<h4>
<p>
2.1 Return to the glossary which was produced in Exercise 1.1.
Review the definitions of any terms which were introduced in Chapter
1 to see if your understanding has changed. Add the new terms
from Chapter 2.

<p>
2.2 Adapt the client program developed in this chapter to make
use of, and demonstrate, three instances of the <i>Friends</i>
class. 

<p>
2.3 Adapt the program from Exercise 2.2 so that a class wide call
of the <i>numberOfFriendsIs()</i>
action follows each call of the constructor. Output the value
returned each time to demonstrate that it is actually counting
the number of instances constructed. 

<p>
2.4 Extend the <i>Friends</i>
class so that it stores the phone number of the friend; this can
be suitably represented as a String.
Change the signature of the constructor to require a phone number
and provide a <i>phoneNumberIs()</i> action. Make suitable changes to the <i>FriendDemo
main()</i> action to demonstrate that the changes seem
to be implemented correctly. <br>

<p>
2.5 Find out what happens if a call of an instance action is made
with a variable which does not yet designate a constructed instance.
Then demonstrate that it is possible to use a class wide action
without constructing an instance of the class. <br>

<p>
2.6 A burger can be <i>meat</i>, <i>fish</i> or <i>vegetarian</i>
and can be served with a <i>baked potato</i> or <i>french fries</i>.
Design, implement and demonstrate a <i>Burger</i>
class which encapsulates the <i>burgerKind</i>
and <i>sideDish</i> attributes
