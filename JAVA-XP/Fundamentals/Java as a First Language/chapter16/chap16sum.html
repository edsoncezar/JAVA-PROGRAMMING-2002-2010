<h2>Chapter 16 Summary<br>
</h2>
<h2>
<ul>
<li>The Java AWT hierarchy supplies a collection of Components
which provide the objects from which GUIs can be constructed.
<p>

<li>The Panel class, and so classes extended from it, have the
capability of laying out their instance children.
<p>

<li>Layout management policies are determined by instances of
classes which implement the LayoutManager
interface; these include the BorderLayout,
FlowLayout and GridLayout
classes.
<p>

<li>The Applet class extends
the Panel class to add the capability
to interact with the user, and can be extended to produce an application's
GUI.
<p>

<li>The design of a GUI should start with its visual appearance
and continue with a design for its behaviour, expressed as a State
Transition Diagram and a state table.
<p>

<li>The component instance hierarchy identifies, and names, the
objects which will be used to construct the interface.
<p>

<li>When the user interacts with the interface an Event
is dispatched to the <i>action()</i>
action of the interface which, if it can handle it completely,
should return the value <b>true</b>.
<p>

<li>Applications with a GUI can be thought of, and designed and
implemented in three layers: a presentation layer which controls
the visual appearance of the interface, an application layer which
supplies the application's functionality and a translation layer
which implements the interface's behaviour.
