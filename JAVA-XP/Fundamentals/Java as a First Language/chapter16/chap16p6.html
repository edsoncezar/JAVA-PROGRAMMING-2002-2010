<h2>16.6 Application, presentation and translation layers<br>
</h2>

<p>
One way of thinking about applications with a graphical user interface
is as a three layered artefact. An <i><b>application layer</b></i>
which implements the essential behaviour of the application and
in this example is represented by the <i>RoomMonitor</i>
encapsulated instance. The <i><b>translation layer</b></i> sits
above the application layer and is responsible for communicating
between the application layer and the remaining layer, the <i><b>presentation
layer</b></i>, which is responsible for the visual representation
of the application. In this example the translation layer is represented
by the <i>action()</i> and <i>transition()</i>
actions and the remaining actions represent the presentation layer.
<br>

<p>
This architecture is illustrated in Figure 16.10, which also shows
what happens when the user presses the increment button when the
application is in its <i>reset</i> state. <br>

<p>
The application and GUI presented in this chapter is one of the
simplest which could have been presented as a semi-realistic application.
As GUIs become larger it is absolutely essential that the design
considerations introduced in this chapter are followed. A slightly
more complex application than this would require that the translation
and presentation layers were more clearly separated, by being
implemented as different classes. The <i>action()</i>
action of the presentation instance would then call the actions
of the translation object which would implement the interface's
behaviour by co-ordinating calls of the application and presentation
objects. <br>

<p>
One major advantage of this design approach, apart from dividing
a large specification into three distinct parts, is that the application
layer and the majority of the translation layer would require
no changes if the user interface were restyled. <br>
