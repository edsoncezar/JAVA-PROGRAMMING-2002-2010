<h2>16.2 The component instance hierarchy<br>
</h2>

<p>
The next stage in the production of this GUI is to decide upon
the various components which will be required and their relationships
with each other. Figure 16.4 presents a partial Java AWT class
hierarchy diagram, containing the component classes which will
be required for this interface.<br>

<p>
All of the AWT components are extended from the Component
class. The Button class will
be used for the three push buttons at the bottom of the interface
and six instances of the Label
class will be used in the display area at the top, three on the
left to label the values and three on the right to display the
numbers. The extended Container
classes have the capacity to contain other components within themselves
and to control their layout. To accomplish <i><b>layout management</b></i>
a class which implements the LayoutManager
interface has to be used. The three classes at the bottom of the
diagram, the BorderLayout, <i>FlowLayout</i>
and GridLayout classes, are examples
of such classes. The Panel class
provides fundamental layout capability and its only child, the
Applet class, adds the capability
to post itself to the display and interact with the user. <br>

<p>
In order to obtain the visual appearance shown in Figure 16.1
a number of Panels have to be
used. The display area at the top of the interface will have to
have its own Panel as will the
control area at the bottom. Both of these Panels
will themselves be mounted upon an Applet
Panel. If the intermediate Panels
were not used then it would be very difficult, if not impossible,
to obtain the desired, aesthetically pleasing, layout as required.
The relationship between all these components is illustrated in
Figure 16.5.<br>

This diagram indicates that the six labels providing the displays
will be mounted onto a Panel
which will in turn be mounted at the top of an Applet.
Likewise the three Buttons providing
the controls will be mounted on their own Panel
which will be mounted at the bottom of the Applet.
The logical relationship between these components is illustrated
in Figure 16.6, known as the <i><b>component instance hierarchy</b></i>,
which also introduces names for the components.<br>
