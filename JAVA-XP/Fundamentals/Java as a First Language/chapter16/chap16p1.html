<h2>16.1 The visual and behavioural design of the GUI<br>
</h2>

<p>
The starting point for the development of a GUI should be a visualisation
of what the interface will look like when it is constructed. The
visual design of the <i>RoomMonitorGUI</i>
is presented in Figure 16.1.<br>

<p>

<br>
<center>Figure 16.1 The visual design of the <i>RoomMoniotrGUI</i>.
<br>
</center>
<p>
This visual design uses location and proximity to divide the appearance
into two areas: an upper <i>display area</i> and a lower <i>control
area</i>. The upper area contains three rows of information which
are from top the bottom, the <i>current</i> number of people in
the room, the <i>maximum</i> number of people in the room and
the <i>total</i> number of people who have ever entered the room.
The <i>nnnn</i> associated with each of these labels indicates
a four digit indication of the value. The lower area contains
three push buttons which will, from left to right, record the
<i>entry</i> of a person into the room, <i>reset</i> the room
monitor and record when a person <i>leave</i>s the room.<br>

<p>
Having produced a visual design for the interface its behaviour
can now be designed. The initial visual state of the interface,
when it is first posted to the display, should be that all three
displays are set to 0000. At this point the only sensible action
is to record the entry of a person into the room, accordingly
only the <i>entry</i> button should be active and the two other
buttons should be unavailable. <br>

<p>
After the first person has been admitted, the displays should
respond as appropriate, and all three buttons should become active.
In this state pressing the <i>entry</i> button should record the
entry of another person into the room. Pressing the <i>leave</i>
button should record a person exiting from the room causing the
<i>leave</i> button to become unavailable as, as there are no
people in the room so no one can leave. Pressing the <i>reset</i>
button should reset all three displays to 0000 and restore the
buttons to their initial pattern of sensitivity.<br>

<p>
During its normal operation, people will be continually entering
and leaving the room causing the displays to be continually updated.
From time to time the room will be empty and in this state the
<i>leave</i> button should become unavailable. Likewise if the
room is ever full the <i>entry</i> button should become unavailable.
At all times, after the entry of the first person, the <i>reset</i>
button should be available. This behavioural design of the interface
can be expressed in a State Transition Diagram, as shown in Figure
16.2. <br>

<p>
The diagram shows that the application has four states identified
as the <i>reset&nbsp;state</i>, the <i>counting&nbsp;state</i>,
the <i>minimal&nbsp;state</i> and the <i>maximal&nbsp;state</i>.
The <i>initial&nbsp;state</i>, before the interface is posted
to the display is also considered and is represented by the dotted
circle at the top of the diagram. More complex applications would
have a control to terminate the application and un-post the display.
This state would be represented by a second dotted circle with
a transition leading from the interface to it.<br>

<p>
The STD also shows the nine possible transitions in its behaviour
each of which, apart from the initial transition, is associated
with some action by the user. The first transition, transition
1, is from the <i>initial</i> to the <i>reset</i> state and is
not under the user's control. Its responsibility is to prepare
the interface, making sure that it is in its <i>reset</i> state
and then shown to the user. From this state there is a single
possible transition, transition 2, to the <i>counting</i> state
which will be taken when the <i>enter</i> button is pressed. The
consequences of this transition are to update the displays and
to set all buttons sensitive.<br>

<p>
From the <i>counting</i> state pressing the <i>enter</i> button
can have one of two consequences. If the value of the current
number of people in the room is not one less than the maximum
number of people then the effect is to return to the same, <i>counting</i>
state, shown as transition 3. Otherwise, if the current number
counted is at its pre-maximal value, pressing the <i>enter</i>
button will cause transition 4 to the <i>maximal</i> state, where
the <i>enter</i> button becomes unavailable.<br>

<p>
A similar pattern of events happens if the <i>leave</i> button
is pressed in the <i>counting</i> state. If the current value
is not one greater than the minimum value transition 5 returns
to the <i>counting</i> state. Otherwise, if the value is pre-minimal,
transition 6 takes the interface to the <i>minimal</i> state,
where the <i>leave</i> button becomes unavailable.<br>

<p>
Pressing the <i>leave</i> button in the <i>maximal</i> state will
always cause transition 4, back to the <i>counting</i> state,
to be followed. Likewise pressing the <i>enter</i> button in the
<i>minimal</i> state will always cause transition 8, back to the
<i>counting</i> state, to be followed. From any of the <i>minimal</i>,
<i>counting</i> or <i>maximal</i> states pressing the <i>reset</i>
button effects transition 9 to the <i>reset</i> state. This is
indicated by the round edged box bounding all of these states
and from which transition 9 originates. These considerations can
be expressed in a <i><b>state table</b></i>, as presented in Figure
16.3.<br>

<p>
The combination of the state transition diagram and state tables
provides a concise and unambiguous description of the required
behaviour of the interface when it is constructed. It is a specification
of <i><b>what</b></i> interface is to be built and can be tested
at this stage by investigations and walk-throughs to make sure
that it will be effective and useable, before resources are committed
to building it. As with many of the examples in this book it is
possibly unnecessary for an application of this complexity to
be designed to this extent. However, it illustrates, and allows
practise of, the design techniques which will definitely be required
for more complex applications. <br>
