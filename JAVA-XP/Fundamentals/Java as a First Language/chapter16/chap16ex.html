<h2>Exercises for Chapter 16<br>
</h2>
<ul>
<h2>
<p>
16.1 The location of the <i>reset</i> button in this interface
may cause it to be accidentally pressed. Redesign the visual appearance
of the interface, and then re-implement it, to mitigate this potential
problem.<br>

<p>
16.2 Design and implement a graphical user interface for the <i>ClickCounter</i>
class from Chapter 3.<br>

<p>
16.3 Design and implement a graphical user interface for the <i>VehicleCounter</i>
class from Exercise 4.6.<br>

<p>
16.4 When you are next using a commercial application with a graphical
user interface, choose one of the dialog panels and deconstruct
it to produce a component instance hierarchy. If you had the opportunity,
what design changes would you make to this interface?<br>

<p>
16.5 Design and implement a stopwatch application. When the <i>start</i>
Button is pressed the thread should be started and it should sleep
for one tenth of a second before updating the numeric value on
a Label. When the <i>stop</i> button is pressed the thread should
be suspended. The interface should also provide <i>resume</i>
and <i>reset</i> buttons with their sensitivities changing as
appropriate.<br>
