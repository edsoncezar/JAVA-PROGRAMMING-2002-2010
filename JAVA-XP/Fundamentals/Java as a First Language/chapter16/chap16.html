<h1>Chapter 16 Graphical User Interfaces<br>
</h1>

<p>
In this final chapter the Java facilities for the construction
of <i><b>G</b></i>raphical <i><b>U</b></i>ser <i><b>I</b></i>nterfaces
(<i><b>GUI</b></i>s) will be introduced. The preceding chapters
should have emphasised that the design and construction of quality
software artefacts is a difficult, laborious and error-prone task.
The construction of GUIs adds further layers of complexity to
this process, accordingly; this chapter can only provide an initial
familiarity with some of the techniques and Java resources which
can be used. <br>

<p>
The Java <i><b>A</b></i>bstract <i><b>W</b></i>indowing <i><b>T</b></i>oolkit
(<i><b>AWT</b></i>) contains a, rather primitive, collection of
classes which supply the various components which can be used
to build GUIs. These include labels, push&nbsp;buttons, sliders,
text boxes and menus, collectively known as <i><b>components</b></i>.
Together they form the AWT class hierarchy which allows the pre-supplied
components to be extended in order to supply a specialised functionality
if required. However, these considerations are outside the scope
of this book.<br>

<p>
In previous chapters it has been repeatedly emphasised that the
usability considerations are an essential part of designing an
application. This is even more important with GUIs as the user
has far more more control over the pattern of interaction. With
the text based interfaces used so far, the dialogue between the
user and the computer has very largely been under the control
of the software which imposes a pre-determined sequence upon the
pattern of interactions. GUIs give much more control to the user,
offering them a collection of components and allowing them to
interact with them in any sequence.<br>

<p>
In order to implement the software to respond to the user's actions
an additional design technique, known as <i><b>S</b></i>tate <i><b>T</b></i>ransition
<i><b>D</b></i>iagrams (<i><b>STD</b></i>s), will have to be introduced.
In order to demonstrate these techniques a GUI for the <i>RoomMonitor</i>
object, first introduced in Chapter 5, will be developed and presented.
