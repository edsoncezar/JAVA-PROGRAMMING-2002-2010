<h2>
    Let's Play
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

To play BINGO, a Game application must be running somewhere on your
network and you must run the Player application. Any number of Player
applications can play against each other using the same Game application.
So if you run the Game application on your machine, you can invite
your friends to play with you. If you are playing against a Game running
on someone else's machine you can skip steps 3 and 4.

<p>
Both the Game and the Player use the JFC components in the "Swing" release.
Follow the steps outlined in
<a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\start\index.html">Getting Started with Swing</a><a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\start\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1_1.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the new JDK 1.1 documentation)"></a> to download the Swing release and to set up your environment.

<p>
Here are the steps to building and playing BINGO:
<ul>
<li> <a href="#download">Step 1: Download the Source</a>
<li> <a href="#compile">Step 2: Compile the Source</a>
<li> <a href="#rungame">Step 3: Run the Game</a>
<li> <a href="#startgame">Step 4: Start the Games</a>
<li> <a href="#runplayer">Step 5: Run the Player</a>
<li> <a href="#joingame">Step 6: Join the Next Game</a>
<li> <a href="#play">Step 7: Play</a>
</ul>

<a name="download">
<h4>Step1: Download the Source</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
More than 40 source files comprise this example. For your convenience,
we include a downloadable zip archive that contains all of the
source files necessary to build the BINGO Player and Game applications.
<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.javasoft.com/docs/tut-bingo.zip">Download the zip archive</a><p>

</blockquote>

<a name="compile">
<h4>Step 2: Compile the Source</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Here's an example of building the BINGO Player and Game applications:

<blockquote>
<pre>
1> <b>/java/jdk1.1.5/bin/javac -classpath \
   .:/java/swing-1.0/swing.jar:/java/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.zip \
   bingo/game/*.java</b>
2> <b>/java/jdk1.1.5/bin/rmic bingo.game.RegistrarImpl</b>
3> <b>mv RegistrarImpl_*.class bingo/game</b>
4> <b>/java/jdk1.1.5/bin/javac -classpath \
   .:/java/swing-1.0/swing.jar:/java/jdk1.1.5/lib/classes.zip \
   bingo/player/*.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name="rungame">
<h4>Step 3: Run the Game</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Before running the Game application you have to run the RMI registry program.
Typically, you will run this program as a background process:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% rmiregistry &
</pre>
</blockquote>
This program is used with RMI to register remote objects.

<hr>
<strong>Some notes about running <code>rmiregistry</code></strong>:
You <strong>must</strong>
have your classpath environment set, and it must have '.' in it
when you run <code>rmiregistry</code>.
Otherwise, when you run the Game you will get an error message
that says it can't find the <code>RegistrarImpl_Stub</code> file.
<p>
If you already have an <code>rmiregistry</code> running,
you will get an error to the effect that port 1099 is busy.
You have three options:
<ol>
<li>don't worry about it and just run the Game,
<li>kill the <code>rmiregistry</code> process and start it up again, or
<li>run another <code>rmiregistry</code> and specify a different port.
</ol>
<hr>
<p>
Now, run the Game application. To do this, follow the directions outlined in
<a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\start\index.html">Getting Started with Swing</a><a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\start\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1_1.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the new JDK 1.1 documentation)"></a> that describe how to run a Swing application.
If all goes well, you will see this window displayed on your screen:

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/together/controlpanel.gif" WIDTH="473" HEIGHT="469" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name="startgame">
<h4>Step 4: Start the Games</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
To start the games rolling:
<ol>
<li>
Enter the number of seconds the game should pause between calling balls.
If you want a fast game with one card, 3 seconds works well. Add a couple
of seconds for each additional card. If many players are playing consider
using 10 - 20 seconds.
<li>
After the first player registers, the Game begins a count down.
During the countdown period other players can register for this game.
After the countdown period expires the game begins and registration closes for
this game. Enter how long the countdown period should last.
If you're playing alone, use 10 seconds so that there's enough time
for the CardWindow to appear after the Player has joined the game.
<li>
Enter the maximum number of players allowed to play in a single game.
<li>
Enter the maximum number of cards each player is allowed to play in a single game.
<li>
Push the <strong>Let the Games Begin</strong> button.
</ol>

The Game will continually serve up games until you stop them
by clicking the <strong>No More New Games</strong> button (or kill the Game process).
This button just tells the Game not to start any more games
after the current game is finished. Pushing this button will
<strong>not</strong> stop the current game.
</blockquote>

<a name="runplayer">
<h4>Step 5: Run the Player</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Now run the Player and instruct your friends to run the Player as well.
The Player also uses Swing components, so you must run the Player as
described in
<a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\start\index.html">Getting Started with Swing</a><a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\start\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1_1.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the new JDK 1.1 documentation)"></a>.

<p>
If all goes well, you should see this window displayed on your screen:

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/together/player.gif" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="352" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<a name="joingame">
<h4>Step 6: Join the Next Game</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>

To join the next game, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>
If you want, type in your name.
<li>
If you want, type in a different seed value. This is the value used
to generate your BINGO cards. The default value is the return
value from <code>System.currentTimeMillis</code> when the window gets created.
You will always play the same cards if you always use the same seed.
<li>
Type the host name where the Game is running.
The Player application figures out the name of the host on which the
Player application is running and enters this name in the hostname textfield.
If you are running your own Game then you can just leave this
value as is. If you want to play with a Game running on another
machine, type the name of that machine into the text field.
<li>
Choose the number of cards you'd like to play.
<li>
Click the <strong>Join the Next Game</strong> button.
<p>
If you're running a Game then you should see your name appear
in the player list.
<p>
After a time, you will see one of these windows for each card
you requested.

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/together/card.gif" WIDTH="417" HEIGHT="464" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<a name="play">
<h4>Step 7: Play</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Periodically, the Game announces a BINGO ball.
The current ball is displayed on the left side of the
player's light board. The right side shows all of the balls
that have been called in this game thus far.

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/together/called.gif" WIDTH="430" HEIGHT="105" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>

Mark the numbers on your card as the balls are called.
When you have 5 adjacent numbers marked horizontally,
vertically or diagonally, push the <strong>I Won! BINGO I Won!</strong> button.
<p>
If you really won, the Game will stop the current game, and
tell you that you've won. If not, the current game
continues until somebody wins, or until the balls run out.
<p>
But wait! Don't push the <strong>I Won! BINGO I Won!</strong> button too often.
If you "cry wolf" (push the <strong>I Won! BINGO I Won!</strong> button and don't have
a winning card) three times, you're kicked out of the game.
After all, that's very disruptive to the other players!
