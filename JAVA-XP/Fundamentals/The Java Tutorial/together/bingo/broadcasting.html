<h2>
    Broadcasting Game Information
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The Game sends three kinds of information to the Players:
<ol>
<li> BINGO balls
<li> Player status updates (such as when a new player registers
     or when a player cries wolf)
<li> Game status updates (such as when the game is about to
     begin, when the game is over, and so on)
</ol>

The Game needs to send this information to all of the Players
simultaneously. Most notably, the balls must be sent to all Players
at the same time so that the Game does not favor one Player over
the others--timing can make a critical difference in the game.
Sending information to many recipients at the same time can
be accomplished using UDP and is known as <em>broadcasting</em>.
If you don't know about UDP and how it works, refer to
<a target="_top" href="..\..\networking\overview\index.html">Overview of Networking</a><a href="..\..\networking\overview\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/networkingIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Custom Networking trail)"></a> and
<a target="_top" href="..\..\networking\datagrams\index.html">All About Datagrams</a><a href="..\..\networking\datagrams\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/networkingIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Custom Networking trail)"></a>.

<p>
To broadcast a tidbit of information to the Players, the Game
creates a <code>DatagramPacket</code> containing the information
encoded in a byte array.
The Game addresses the packet with a destination port number
and a <em>group identifier</em> specified by a class D Internet address.
The port number is an arbitrarily chosen number that the Player
and Game have agreed to use.
The group identifier simply identifies what type of information
is contained in the packet.

<p>
The Game uses three different group identifiers each of which
identifies one of the three kinds of information sent by the Game.
Thus ball packets are marked with the <code>BallListeningGroup</code>
identifier, the player status packets are marked with
the <code>PlayerListenerGroup</code> identifier,
and the game status packets are
marked with the <code>GameListenerGroup</code> identifier.

<p>
To receive information broadcast by the Game, the Player
opens a <code>MulticastSocket</code> on the same port number
used by the Game to create its <code>DatagramPacket</code>.
Next the Player asks the <code>MulticastSocket</code> 
to join one of the groups that the Game used to
create its <code>DatagramPacket</code>.
That <code>MulticastSocket</code> will only receive packets destined
for that port and marked with that group identifier.
If the Player wants information for a different group,
it must create a different <code>MulticastSocket</code>
and have it join a different group.

<p>
Using UDP in this way, the Game can broadcast information to all
the Players simultaneously and uses only one port
for all of its status updates. Additionally,
through the use of group identifiers, the Game can 
identify the different kinds of information thereby allowing
the Player application to receive only the information that it wants.

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/together/multicasting.gif" WIDTH="566" HEIGHT="277" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
Currently, the Player application listens for announced balls and
game status updates, but ignores player updates.
<p>
As the diagram implies, one interesting side-effect of
broadcasting information to the Players is that the Game can listen
to the information, too. This particular side-effect was used to advantage
to design the various status panes to operate independently of the Game.
Instead of having the Game directly update the status panes
within its code, the status panes update themselves by listening to the
broadcast information. Thus the status panes can be shared by the
Player application (or any other application) as well.
You can read more about this in [PENDING].

<h4>How the Game Broadcasts Information</h4>
<blockquote>
The
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/game/SocketGate.java"><code>SocketGate</code></a>
class, as its name implies, is the gate through which all information is
broadcast from the Game application.
<p>
The Game application creates and uses one instance of <code>SocketGate</code>
for the entire program. The 
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/game/RingMaster.java"><code>RingMaster</code></a>
creates the <code>SocketGate</code> in its constructor:
<blockquote>
<pre>
socketGate = new SocketGate();
</pre>
</blockquote>
The constructor for <code>SocketGate</code> creates a
<code>MulticastSocket</code> through which the Game sends
<code>DatagramPacket</code>s. Additionally, the constructor
creates three <code>InetAddress</code>'s. These are the
group identifiers for the game. There is one group identifier
for each type of information broadcast from the Game: balls,
player status, and game status.
<blockquote>
<pre>
SocketGate () throws java.io.IOException {
    socket = new MulticastSocket(Constants.portNumber);

    ballListeningGroup = InetAddress.getByName(Constants.BallListeningGroup);
    playerListeningGroup = InetAddress.getByName(Constants.PlayerListeningGroup);
    gameListeningGroup = InetAddress.getByName(Constants.GameListeningGroup);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The argument to the constructor for the <code>MulticastSocket</code>,
<code>Constants.portNumber</code>, is the port to which the socket is bound.
The actual port number doesn't matter except that 
the Game and the Player agree on what it is
and it's not one of the reserved port numbers between
0 and 1023. The BINGO game port number is 52596 which is
Sophia's birthday (5/25/96).
<p>
Group identifiers are class D Internet address which range
from 224.0.0.1 and 239.255.255.255.
As with the port number, the actual addresses used by the BINGO game
don't matter as long as the Player and Game agree on what they are.
The addresses we chose for the BINGO game are consecutive and are
as follows (for no particular reason at all):
<ul>
<li> <code>Constants.BallListeningGroup</code> is "230.0.0.1"
<li> <code>Constants.PlayerListeningGroup</code> is "230.0.0.2"
<li> <code>Constants.GameListeningGroup</code> is "230.0.0.3"
</ul>

<p>
All information is broadcast from the Game via the
<code>sendBytes</code> method provided by
<code>SocketGate</code>.
Given an array of bytes and a group identifier, <code>sendBytes</code>
packages the array into a <code>DatagramPacket</code> and sends it on
its way.
<blockquote>
<pre>
private void sendBytes(byte[] data, InetAddress group) {
    DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(data, data.length, group,
					       Constants.portNumber);
    try {
        socket.send(packet);
    } catch (java.io.IOException e) {
        // PENDING: what should go in here?
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The <code>sendBytes</code> method is called from each of the three
convenience methods implemented by <code>SocketGate</code> to send
each kind of information sent by the Game:
<blockquote>
<pre>
void sendBall(BingoBall b) {
    sendBytes(b.getBytes(), ballListeningGroup);
}

void sendPlayerStatusMessage(PlayerRecord p) {
    sendBytes(p.getBytes(), playerListeningGroup);
}

void sendGameStatusMessage(String msg) {
    sendBytes(msg.getBytes(), gameListeningGroup);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The information sent in a <code>Datagrampacket</code> must
be bytes, so all of the information is converted to bytes before
being broadcast. The receiver must reconstruct the actual
information from bytes on the other side. You'll see this in
<a href="#RECEIVING">How to Receive Information Broadcast by the Game</a>.
<p>
Note that the code is a bit cavalier about converting
everything to bytes. Although careless, the code works
for all of the converted data except in one, unlikely, scenario.
<p>
The BINGO ball numbers always survive the conversion because
they range from 1 to 75 which is small enough to fit into a byte.
The game status string survives the conversion because the code
calls the <code>getBytes</code> method from the <code>String</code>
class which automatically encodes Unicode characters to bytes
(and back again on the other side) using the default character
encoding.
<p>
Potential problems occur with the player status.
The player name is a <code>String</code> and survives the conversion for the
same reason that the game status string survives.
However, problems may occur with the numbers in the player
status--the player ID, the number of cards used by the player,
and the number of wolf cries made by the player--which are all
declared to be integers.
<p>
By default, the game parameters limit these numbers to those
that fit within a byte (player ID won't exceed 100, the number of cards
won't exceed 3, and so on). However, if you change the game parameters,
and allow them to exceed 255, then the numbers will not survive
the conversion and will be broadcast incorrectly.

<a name="RECEIVING">
<h4>How to Receive Information Broadcast by the Game</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
The <code>bingo.shared</code> package contains three
classes whose sole purpose is to just sit around and listen for packets to
come across a <code>MulticastSocket</code>. Each class listens
for packets marked with a different group identifier:
<ul>
<li><code>BallListenerThread</code> listens for packets marked with
    the <code>BallListeningGroup</code> identifer
<li><code>GameListenerThread</code> listens for packets marked with
    the <code>GameListeningGroup</code> identifier
<li><code>PlayerListenerThread</code> listens for packets marked with
    the <code>PlayerListeningGroup</code> identifier
</ul>

All of the listening thread classes subclass the abstract superclass called
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/shared/ListenerThread.java"><code>ListenerThread</code></a>
shown here:
<blockquote>
<pre>
package bingo.shared;

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public abstract class ListenerThread extends Thread {

    boolean stopListening = false;
    MulticastSocket socket;

    private InetAddress group;
    private String groupString;

    public ListenerThread(String groupString) throws UnknownHostException, IOException
    {
	super();

	this.groupString = groupString;

        this.group = InetAddress.getByName(groupString);
        socket = new MulticastSocket(Constants.portNumber);
	socket.joinGroup(group);
    }

    public void stopListening() {
	stopListening = true;
    }

    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
	socket.leaveGroup(group);
	socket.close();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The abstract superclass provides a constructor that its subclasses
must call from their constructors, a mechanism for gently stopping
the thread, and a <code>finalize</code> method.
<p>
As you can see from the code, the constructor in <code>ListenerThread</code>
creates a group identifier based on the group string passed into the constructor.
The group string is passed into the constructor by a subclass constructor.
The <code>BallListenerThread</code> subclass passes in
<code>Constants.BallListeningGroup</code>, and so on.
This is the same group used by the Game to address packets sent
to the <code>MulticastSocket</code>.
<p>
The constructor then creates a <code>MulticastSocket</code> on the
BINGO port, and joins a group on that socket. By joining the group
this thread will only receive information for that particular group.
Each ListenerThread must have its own <code>MulticastSocket</code>
because a <code>MulticastSocket</code> can join only one group at a time.
Thus a <code>MulticastSocket</code> cannot be shared for listening as
it can be for broadcasting.
<p>
The subclasses of <code>ListenerThread</code> each provide their own
<code>run</code> method which are all similar.
Each loops until <code>stopListening</code> becomes <code>true</code>.
During each iteration of the loop, the thread waits for a packet to come
over the socket. When a packet arrives, the thread gets the information
from the packet, converts it from bytes to the appropriate type,
and notifies another object (its notifyee) of the event.

<p>
The three subclasses of <code>ListenerThread</code> are basically the
same, so let's just look at one: the
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/shared/BallListenerThread.java"><code>BallListenerThread</code></a>
class:
<blockquote>
<pre>
package bingo.shared;

import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class BallListenerThread extends ListenerThread {

    private BallListener notifyee;

    public BallListenerThread(BallListener notifyee) throws IOException {

	super(Constants.BallListeningGroup);
	this.notifyee = notifyee;
    }

    public synchronized void run() {
	DatagramPacket packet;

        while (stopListening == false) {
	    byte[] buf = new byte[256];
            packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, 256);
	    try {
                socket.receive(packet);
		byte[] rcvd = packet.getData();
		BingoBall b = new BingoBall(rcvd);
		if (b.getNumber() == BingoBall.GAME_OVER) {
		    notifyee.noMoreBalls();
		} else
		    notifyee.ballCalled(b);

	    } catch (IOException e) {
		    // PENDING: what goes in here?
	    }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The constructor for <code>BallListenerThread</code> requires a
<a href="example-swing\bingo\shared\balllistener.java"><code>BallListener</code></a>--
an object that implements the <code>BallListener</code> interface and thus
implements two methods: <code>ballCalled</code> and <code>noMoreBalls</code>.
The <code>BallListenerThread</code> notifies its <code>BallListener</code> whenever a ball
is called, or when the end-of-game ball arrives by calling the appropriate
one of those two methods.
The notifyee then takes whatever action is appropriate.
<p>
<p>
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/shared/PlayerListenerThread.java"><code>PlayerListenerThread</code></a>
is similar but its <code>notifyee</code> is a
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/shared/PlayerListener.java"><code>PlayerListener</code></a>.
Likewise,
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/shared/GameListenerThread.java"><code>GameListenerThread</code></a>'s
<code>notifyee</code> is a
<a href="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/together/bingo/example-swing/bingo/shared/GameListener.java"><code>GameListener</code></a>.
