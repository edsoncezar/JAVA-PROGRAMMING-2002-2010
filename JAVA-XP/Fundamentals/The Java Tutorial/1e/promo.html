overall rating of 10 out of 10.
<p>
<B>The best overall introduction to Java I've seen</B>
<p>
I haven't read the printed version, but I've gone through the online Java 1.1 tutorial at
www.javasoft.com, and it's a stellar achievement. The material is clear, concise, and
informative. The organization is logical and easy to follow, and the use of multiple
"trails" to guide the reader through the *relevant* sections of the tutorial based on
his or her interest is a wonderful innovation. 
<p>
Even the most experienced Java programmers I know continually learn new tricks and
techniques from the tutorial. The new material on JavaBeans, the 1.1 JNI interface, and other
new Java 1.1 features is especially welcome. 
<p>
A must-read for anyone starting out as a Java programmer, and those of us who *think* we
already *know* Java can probably pick up a new trick or two as well.

"This book rocks....
We think it's an awesome tutorial straight from

4 stars.  "This book is the right choice
if you are a Java programmer or just a hopeful.
The Java Tutorial touched on a lot of unique methods in Java
that others have left undocumented."

"This book is a thorough tutorial on the Java language....
The book is structured so that you can go straight through
or choose your topics at random after the introductory section.
I particularly like that the larger code examples
are relegated to an appendix
so as not to interrupt the flow of the text....
This is a serious book for learning the Java language."
