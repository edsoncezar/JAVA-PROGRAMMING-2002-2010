     Summary
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>

In this trail you've seen how to use Java IDL, the CORBA-compliant
remote object technology, to develop a simple client-server
application, as well as two differnt ways to locate remote CORBA
objects. Java IDL and Java RMI are the two remote-object technologies
provided with the Java Development Kit software.
<P>
This summary compares features of Java RMI and Java IDL to help make it
easier to choose between the two. It also provides pointers to other
sources of information on CORBA, IDL, and the OMG.

<H4>Deciding Whether to Use RMI or IDL</H4>
<blockquote>
Because they have similar purposes, RMI and Java IDL have some similar
features and capabilities--as well as some differences. This section
summarizes several of these similarities and differences to help you
understand these technologies better and make choosing between them
easier.

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>100% Pure Java vs. Support for Legacy Applications</strong>
<dd>
Java RMI is a 100% Pure Java solution for remote objects, providing all
the advantages of Java's &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot;
abilities. Servers and clients developed with Java RMI can be deployed
anywhere on a network on any platform that supports the Java runtime
environment.
<P>
Java IDL, in contrast, is based on an industry standard for remotely
invoking objects written in any supported programming language. As a
result, Java IDL provides a way to connect to &quot;legacy&quot;
applications that still serve vital business needs but that were
written in languages other than Java.

<p>
<dt>
<strong>Communication Protocols</strong>
<dd>
Java RMI and Java IDL currently use different protocols for
communicating between objects on different platforms. Java IDL uses the
CORBA-standard Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP), the protocol shared
by all CORBA-compliant Object Request Brokers. Together with IDL, IIOP
enables objects residing on diverse platforms and written in diverse
languages to interact in standard ways. Java RMI currently uses the
Java Remote Messaging Protocol (JRMP)--a protocol developed
specifically for Java's remote object capabilities.
<p>
For the future, Sun and IBM have announced plans to enable RMI to use
the IIOP protocol to communicate with CORBA-compliant remote
objects.

<p>
<dt>
<strong>Objects by Reference, Objects by Value</strong>
<dd>
In Java IDL, a client interacts with a remote object by reference. That
is, the client never gets an actual copy of the server object in its
own runtime environment. Instead, the client uses stubs in the local
runtime to manipulate the server object residing on the remote
platform.
<P>
In contrast, RMI enables a client to interact with a remote object by
reference, or to download it and manipulate it in the local runtime
environment by value. This is because all objects in RMI are Java
objects. RMI uses the object serialization capabilities of the Java
language to transport objects from the server to the client. Java IDL,
because it interacts with objects written in any language, can't take
advantage of this &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; feature of the
Java programming language.
<P>
Note that future versions of the CORBA specification will include
protocols for passing objects by value.
