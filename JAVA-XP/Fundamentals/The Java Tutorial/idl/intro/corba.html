<h2>
    The CORBA Architecture
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

In this section, you get some additional detail on CORBA, IDL, and the
Java IDL ORB promised earlier.
<P>
Any relationship between distributed objects has two sides: the client
and the server. The server provides a remote interface, and the client
calls a remote interface. These relationships are common to most
distributed object standards, including RMI and CORBA. Note that in
this context, the terms client and server define object-level rather
than application-level interaction--any application could be a server
for some objects and a client of others. In fact, a single object could
be the client of an interface provided by a remote object and at the
same time implement an interface to be called remotely by other
objects.
<P>
This figure shows how a one-method distributed object is shared between
a CORBA client and server to implement the classic
&quot;Hello World&quot; application.

A one-method distributed object shared between a CORBA client and server.
</center>
<P>
On the client side, the application includes a reference for the remote
object. The object reference has a stub method, which is a stand-in for
the method being called remotely. The stub is actually wired into the
ORB, so that calling it invokes the ORB's connection capabilities,
which forwards the invocation to the server.
<P>
On the server side, the ORB uses skeleton code to translate the remote
invocation into a method call on the local object. The skeleton
translates the call and any parameters to their implementation-specific
format and calls the method being invoked. When the method returns, the
skeleton code transforms results or errors, and sends them back to the
client via the ORBs.
<P>
Between the ORBs, communication proceeds by means of a shared protocol,
IIOP--the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol. IIOP, which is based on the
standard TCP/IP internet protocol, defines how CORBA-compliant ORBs
pass information back and forth. Like CORBA and IDL, the IIOP standard
is defined by OMG, the Object Management Group.
<P>
In addition to these simple distributed object capabilities,
CORBA-compliant ORBs can provide a number of optional services defined
by the OMG. These include services for looking up objects by name,
maintaining persistent objects, supporting transaction processing,
enabling messaging, and many other abilities useful in today's
distributed, multi-tiered computing environments. Several Java ORBs
from third-party vendors support some or all of these additional
capabilities. The ORB provided with Java IDL supports one optional
service, the ability to locate objects by name.
