<td> <strong>Deborah Adair</strong>,
     the technical writer for the Java Media group at Sun Microsystems,
     specializes in designing and writing documentation for
     software developers and other highly technical readers. She has a
     degree in Scientific and Technical Communication from the
     University of Washington and has been writing for the computer
     industry for the past nine years.

The Java 2D and Java Sound trails could not have been completed without
the help of Jennifer Ball, a summer intern in the Java Software
Technical Publications group. With little assistance or direction and a
lot of hard work and persistence, Jennifer single-handedly wrote most
of the samples used in these trails. The Java Software engineers who
took time out of their own crazy schedules to answer questions and
review these trails also played a major role: Kara Kytle, Brent
Browning, Jerry Evans, Jim Graham, Jeannette Hung, Brian Lichtenwalter,
and Thanh Nguyen. My sincere thanks also go out to Tom Santos, who
donated several hours of his own time to the cause. Not only did he
answer technical questions and help get the samples running under
Swing, he patiently endured living with a stressed-out writer
throughout the entire process.

I'd like to thank the following engineers for their help with foreign
languages: AJ Alhait (Arabic), Gilad Bracha (Hebrew), Norbert Lidenberg
(German), and Benjamin Renaud (French). The following people provided
thoughtful and detailed reviews: Richard Gillam, Waleed Hosny, Doug
Kramer, Norbert Lindenberg, and Laura Werner. In their book, The Java
Class Libraries , Volume 1 , Patrick Chan and Doug Kramer wrote some
terrific code examples that I just had to borrow. And finally, I'm
grateful for the suggestions made by our readers on the Internet. It's
always a good idea to get advice from the real world.
