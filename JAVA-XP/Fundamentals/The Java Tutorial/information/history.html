<strong>Saturnalia, 22 December 97</strong>
<blockquote>
	<strong><em>The long awaited update!</em></strong>--
	this is a <em>major</em> update of the tutorial.
	Almost every file has been touched in some way.
	<p>
	This release of the online tutorial corresponds with the
	release of the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book
	and is the version of the online tutorial that appears on
	the CD-ROM that accompanies that book.
	<p>
	The changes are in progress, but to a large extent
	we have integrated 1.1 information into
	the existing trails, lessons, and examples. This is
	in sharp contrast to the 1.1 notes that were littered
	throughout the previous version of the tutorial and
	were, admittedly, somewhat confusing.
	<p>
	Also, we are in the process of integrating copyedit and
	other changes made to the book version, into the online version.
	This has been completed thoroughly in some areas of the online
	tutorial, and spottily in other areas. We will continue
	with this process throughout the coming months.

	<p>
	New lessons in this tutorial that first appeared in print
	in the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book:
	<ul>
	<li>
	<strong>The Java Phenomenon</strong>
	<li>
	<strong>Migrating to 1.1</strong>
	<li>
	<strong>A Preview of Things to Come</strong>
	</ul>

	New trails for this version of the tutorial
	that haven't yet made it to print:
	<ul>
	<li>
	Added a <strong>Putting It All Together</strong> trail
	that provides a large, real-world, client/server example and analyzes it.
	<li>
	Got a totally new <strong>JavaBeans Tutorial</strong>
	by Andy Quinn!
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>8 July 97</strong>
<ul>
<li> One of the goals of the tutorial is to document the latest and greatest
     from JavaSoft <em>as it is released</em>.
     To this end, we've added a lesson about
     <strong>Using Swing Components</strong>.
     The Swing release is an early release of part of the JFC.
     This information is only available from the Java Tutorial.
<li> Added a trail, <strong>Java Security 1.1</strong>,
     covering the new 1.1 security APIs.
<li> Updated the The JavaBeans(tm) Tutorial by Greg Voss.
<li> Promoted <strong>Writing Global Programs</strong> to
     a trail. This trail is still in progress, but it contains new material
     including several excellent demos from
     <strong>Taligent</strong>.
<li> Added information about the 1.1 release in our
     <strong>To 1.1 -- And Beyond!</strong> trail.
<li> Made the usual fixes to broken links, typos, and other errata.
</ul>

<p>

<strong>14 May 97</strong>
<blockquote>
We improved and added more 1.1 information in existing sections.
We added more examples of and information about
the various types of event listeners to 
<strong>Handling Events</strong>.
We also fixed the AroundTheWorld applet used in
<strong>Writing Global Programs.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>28 April 97</strong>
<blockquote>
We added a new trail,
<strong>To 1.1 -- And Beyond!</strong>,
which is the headquarters for features added to the JDK after 1.0.
Also, the <strong>Learning the Java Language</strong>
and <strong>Essential Java Classes</strong> trails
now have notes that point out material that is affected by 1.1.
And finally, we reorganized our top-level files to make them more
accessible.
</blockquote>

<strong>3 March 97</strong>
<blockquote>
Added a brand new trail introducing JavaBeans!
This trail, JavaBeans Tutorial, written by Greg Voss,
shows you the ins and outs of developing programs
using the JavaBeans technology.
</blockquote>

<strong>19 February 97</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Our new "guest author" program debuts in this release of the tutorial
with a completely new trail about
writing native methods by Beth Stearns. Check it out:
<strong>Using the Java Native Interface (JNI)</strong>.
<li>
Merged copyediting changes from the book into the on-line version in
these two trails:
<strong>Getting Started</strong> and
<strong>Writing Applets</strong>.
<li>
Updated
<strong>Writing Global Programs</strong>
to work with the FCS JDK 1.1 release.
<li>
The usual miscellaneous fixes.
</ul>


<strong>24 December 96</strong>
<blockquote>
Miscellaneous fixes.

<strong>Writing Global Programs</strong>.
</blockquote>

<strong>6 June 96</strong> -- Released the Sixth DRAFT.
<blockquote>
This draft is the version on which the book version is based.
The book and online versions aren't exactly the same --
for example, none of the copyeditor's changes 
have made it into the online tutorial yet.
Also, the online tutorial's figures haven't been updated
to be the same as those in the book.
Notable content changes since the fifth draft include:

<ul>
<li> Finished the Common Problems pages.
<li> Added information on the Macintosh JDK.
<li> Added an applet anatomy section to Getting Started.
<li> Improved the talk server example in the applet communication lesson.
</ul>

</blockquote>

<strong>28 Mar 96</strong> -- Released the Fifth DRAFT.
<blockquote>
Many pages in this draft have been rewritten
or expanded upon.
(If you've sent us comments and don't see them reflected in this draft,
please don't be insulted -- 
we haven't finished incorporating reviewer comments.)
Some of the notable changes include:

<ul>
<li> Revised Application Anatomy lesson
     and moved it to the Getting Started trail:
     <strong>The Anatomy of a Java Application</strong>.
     We plan to write an equivalent section
     for applets.

     <strong>The Nuts and Bolts of the Java
     Language</strong> and
     <strong>Objects and Classes in Java</strong>.

     Adding an Applet to an HTML Page
     and
     <strong>Summary</strong>.
<li> Beefed up the applet threads pages:
     <strong>Threads in Applets</strong>.
<li> Added a discussion of peers to the UI trail:
     <strong>Details of the Component Architecture</strong>.
<li> Added material to the native methods trail,
     <strong>Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</strong>,
     including passing data into and out of native methods
     and accessing Java objects.
<li> Removed some trails: comparison to C/C++, troubleshooting, and tools.
     This information has been (or will be) incorporated into other
     trails/lessons.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>4 Mar 96</strong> -- Released the Fourth DRAFT
<blockquote>
Among the normal bug, typo and broken link fixes, this draft includes
revisions to many of our old trails and lessons, plus this new material:

<ul>
<li> Added a new lesson to 
     <strong>Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</strong>
     trail.

<li> Added new material to and/or wrote from scratch 4 lessons in the

     <strong>Creating an Applet User Interface</strong>,
     <strong>Communicating with Other Programs</strong>,
     <strong>Understanding Applet Capabilities and Restrictions</strong>,
	and
     <strong>Finishing an Applet</strong>.
     (The first three have since been reorganized into two trails:
     <strong>Taking Advantage of the Applet API</strong>
     and
     <strong>Practical Considerations when Writing Applets</strong>.


</ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>24 Feb 96</strong> -- Released the Third DRAFT
<blockquote>
Among the normal bug, typo and broken link fixes, this draft includes

     <li> <strong>Using Components, the GUI Building Blocks</strong>
          Each component now has a page describing how to use it.

     <li> <strong>Working with Graphics</strong>
          There's now information on how to draw primitive graphics (including text)
          and images, plus information on performing animation. The animation pages

<li>
Changed the name of this document from
"The Java Programmer's Guide" to

broken links and miscommunications.
<li>

which describes
how applets work and how you use the Applet class to create an applet.

<li>
The new
<strong>Creating a User Interface</strong>
trail has two new lessons:

<li>
We've also added the
<strong>Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</strong>
trail that shows you how to integrate native methods
into your Java programs.

<li>
And finally, we've added two new lessons:
<strong>Threads of Control</strong>
and
<strong>Object-Oriented Programming Concepts</strong>.
</ul>
</ul>
