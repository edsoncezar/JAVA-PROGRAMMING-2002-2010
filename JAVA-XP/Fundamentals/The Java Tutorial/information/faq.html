<h2>About the Tutorial</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>

<a name="what">
<strong>What is "the Java tutorial"?</strong>
</a>
<p>
The Java Tutorial is a programmer's guide for the Java platform.
It has two forms:
<ol>
<li>
The <a href="..\index.html">online</a> version--A hyperlinked,
interactive, set of HTML pages available on the World-Wide Web.
The current version documents the JDK 1.1 release,
except where noted otherwise.
<li>
The book--The first edition of <em>The Java(tm) Tutorial</em>
was published in the summer of 1996 and covers the JDK 1.0.2.
The second edition covers JDK 1.1 and is now available
in bookstores.
</ol>

<hr>

<a name="where">
<strong>Where can I get the tutorial?</strong>
</a>
<p>
You can read the tutorial on-line. Start at the trail map:
<a href="..\trailmap.html">The Java Tutorial</a>.
If you prefer to view it on your own system, you can
<a href="download.html">download the tutorial</a> free of charge.
<p>
If you prefer to read paper, you can <a href="#buy">buy</a> the book.
<p>

<hr>

<a name="buy">
<strong>What do I need to know about the books before I buy one?</strong>
</a>
<p>
The <a href="..\1e\book.html">first edition</a> is
over 800 pages long,
lists at about &#36;40 (U.S.),
and includes a CD-ROM.
This edition covers the JDK 1.0.2.
The book has been superceded by the second edition.
<p>
The <a href="..\2e\book.html">second edition</a> is
almost 1000 pages long, lists at about &#36;47 (U.S.),
and includes a CD-ROM.
This edition covers the JDK 1.1.
The book and is now available in bookstores,
or you can 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0201310074/javasoftsunmicroA/">order it through
amazon.com.</a>
Just ask for <em>The Java Tutorial Second Edition</em>
by Mary Campione and Kathy Walrath,
published by Addison-Wesley,
ISBN #0-201-31007-4.
<p>

<hr>
<a name="difference">
<strong>What's the difference between the 1st and 2nd editions of the book?<br>
Which one should I start with being a Java Newbie?<br>
Does the 2nd include the same lessons and introductory lessons as the first?
</strong>
</a>
<p>
In general, we recommend that you get the 2nd edition of the book if you can find
it, unless you need to use 1.0.2, for some reason. The only compelling
reason I can think of to use 1.0.2 is for writing applets for wide
release over the internet to people who might be using old browsers.
<p>
The 1st edition covers 1.0.2, and the 2nd edition covers 1.1. The
differences aren't huge, but they do exist, especially in GUI creation
and native methods.
<p>
We think that, aside from being more up-to-date, the 2nd edition is
just better.  We added a section on what's interesting about Java, and
we significantly rewrote/reorganized some of the lessons.
<p>

<hr>

<a name="howmuch">
<strong>How much does the tutorial cost?</strong>
</a>
<p>
You can view the online version free and
you can <a href="download.html">download</a> it free
(well, excluding connect charges and the like).
<p>
The first edition of the book retails for about &#36;40 (U.S.).
The second edition retails for about &#36;47 (U.S.).
Both books include a CD-ROM that contains the online version.

<p>
<hr>

<a name="version">
<strong>What version of the JDK does the tutorial reflect?</strong>
</a>
<p>
Except where otherwise noted,
the online tutorial reflects
the API distributed in the 1.1 Java Developers Kit (JDK).
The first edition of the book documents JDK 1.0.2.
The second edition of the book documents JDK 1.1.
<p>
<hr>

<a name="contents">
<strong>What topics are covered by the tutorial?</strong>
</a>
<p>
Check out the 
<a href="..\trailmap.html">Trail map</a> for a list

<hr>
<a name="accolades">
<strong>What awards has the tutorial won?</strong>
</a>
<p>
On February 21st, the Northern California branch of the Society for
Technical Communications (STC) announced their awards for 1997.
The first edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> won a Merit Award in the
category "Single-Issue Publications" (better known as retail books).

<p>
In August of 1997, JavaWorld Magazine chose the
first edition of The Java Tutorial as a runner-up
for Best Training Aid.

<h2>About Downloading the Tutorial</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a name="howdownload">
<strong>How do I download the tutorial?</strong>
</a>
<p>
See
<a href="download.html">Download the Tutorial</a>
for information. Unfortunately,
we cannot send the tutorial to individuals
via e-mail.
<p>
If for some reason, you cannot download the tutorial from
the web, consider <a href="#buy">buying the book</a> and using the version
of the tutorial contained on the CD-ROM included with the book.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
If you download the tutorial, feel free to make it available
locally at your site. <em>Please do not publicly mirror
it to the Web!</em>.
See the
<a href="#mirroring">next question and answer</a> to find out why.

<p>
<hr>
<a name="mirroring">
<strong>May I mirror the tutorial publicly?</strong>
</a>
<p>
Our policy on distribution is that 
anyone is permitted have a copy of the online
tutorial as long as it's visible <em>only</em> within their own institution
(university, business, or whatever) and no one is profiting from the
tutorial's distribution.
<p>
We've taken this strict position because the many tutorial mirrors
mean that search engines generally
don't find the most up-to-date version of the tutorial.
Instead, search engines find mirror sites,
which invariably fall behind.
We end up getting e-mail about problems that have been
corrected in newer versions of the tutorial. Or perhaps worse, we
don't get e-mail and the reputation of the tutorial suffers. We allow
local copies because we realize that browsing java.sun.com isn't always
practical.
<p>
When you 
<a href="mailto:tutorial@java.sun.com">tell us about a mirror,</a>
we send the offender a friendly e-mail
asking them to please move their copy of the tutorial
to a place that isn't visible from the outside world.

<p>

<a name="downloadtrouble">
<strong>I'm having trouble downloading the tutorial. What should I do?</strong>

Make sure you tell them the
hardware platform, operating system, and browser you're using.

<h2>About Getting the Tutorial in Other Formats</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a name=otherformats>
<strong>Can I get a PostScript or PDF version of the tutorial to download?</strong>
</a>
<p>
No.
If you want a hard copy of the tutorial,
you can <a href="#buy">buy or borrow the book</a>.
To find out why, read the <a href="#postscript">next question and answer</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<a name="postscript">
<strong>Why isn't the tutorial available in PostScript or PDF?</strong>
</a>
<p>

We used to offer a PostScript version of the tutorial,
but it caused many more problems than
it solved.
There were problems with fonts, page size in Europe, 
older versions of PostScript, and so on.
PDF format might solve some or all of those problems,
but we also got a lot of complaints 
about the actual document: "it's just a PostScript dump of the HTML,"
"the links don't make sense on paper," and so on.
PDF wouldn't solve those problems.
As a result, we no longer provide PostScript,
and we won't be providing it
or PDF in the future.

<strong>Khwarazm and Me?  Who are they?</strong>
</a>
<p>
<em>Khwarazm</em> and <em>me</em> are FrameMaker's suggested respellings
of Kathy and Mary's login names.
For a long time,
we had no idea what <em>Khwarazm</em> meant,
but several readers wrote in to educate us.
Khwarazm is the name both of a Central Asian city
(now Khiva, Uzbekistan) and of a Persian mathematician
born in that city around 780 A.D.
The mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al Khwarazm,
is credited with introducing
the Hindu Arabic decimal number system to the West,
and the concept of zero into Arab mathematics.
The term <em>algebra</em> is taken
from part of the title (<em>al-jabr</em>)
of one of his books.
The word "algorithm"
is derived from his name,
which is alternately spelled al-Khwarizmi
and al Khawrizm.
