The Java Tutorial contains hundreds of complete working examples.
Some of our examples are applets, others are standalone applications.
This page contains three sections that discuss various aspects
of our examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="#directorynames">Example Directory Names</a>
<li> <a href="#multiples">Multiple Versions of the Same Program</a>
<li> <a href="#applets">About the Applets Running in Our Pages</a>
<li> <a href="#plugin">Downloading Java Plug-in</a>
</ul>


<a name="directorynames">
<h4>Example Directory Names</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Each lesson in the tutorial contains
one or more programming examples,
each of which can be composed of one or more files.
A lesson groups its examples
in sub-directories
according to the version of
the JDK required and
whether Swing is required.

<p>
A lesson might have one or more of the following example directories:

<p>

<table cellpadding=5 border=1>
<tr>
<th>Example Directory Name</th>
<th>Program Type</th>
<th>JDK Release/Version</th>
<th>Other libraries</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example</code></td>
<td>Applets and/or applications</td>
<td>JDK 1.0.2</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-1dot1</code></td>
<td>Applets and/or applications</td>
<td>JDK 1.1</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-1dot2</code></td>
<td>Applets and/or applications</td>
<td>JDK 1.2</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-swing</code></td>
<td>Applets and/or applications</td>
<td>JDK 1.1</td>
<td>Swing 1.1</td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<a name="multiples">
<h4>Multiple Versions of the Same Program</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Often, you can find multiple versions of the same program
by looking in each of the example directories in a lesson.
For example, you might find a JDK 1.0.2 version of a program
in <code>example</code> and a JDK 1.1 version of the same program
in <code>example-1dot1</code>.
<p>
We provide multiple versions of the same program for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>
Some developers can't upgrade to the latest version of the JDK
right away because of existing applications and users.
<li>
It's often useful to compare two different versions of the
same program to learn what kinds of changes are required to
migrate from one release to the next.
<li>
Because browser support for applets typically lags the
current release of the JDK,
we sometimes provide multiple versions of each applet --
one that uses the latest version of the JDK,
and one that users can run within their browsers.
<li>
Some of the programs have been around since
the original release of the JDK.
Each version of the program represents a step in the
natural migration of the program as the JDK evolves.
</ul>

<h4>About the Applets Running in our Pages</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Throughout the tutorial, you will encounter running applets.
Our pages contain four different types of applets:
<dl>
<dt> <strong>JDK 1.0.2 Applets</strong>
<dd> These applets are included with an <code>&lt;APPLET&gt;</code> tag
     and appear directly in content pages.
     Most browsers support 1.0.2, so most readers
     will have no trouble running these applets.
     We still run the 1.0.2 versions of the applets even
	if we have a 1.1 or higher version available because
	some older browsers don't support anything higher.
     This ensures that most of our readers
	can run the applet.
     These applets are followed by a note that looks like this
	(the links below don't work):

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong> Because some old browsers don't support 1.1, the above applet is a <em>1.0</em> version (here is the <a href="http://docs.rinet.ru:8080/Jtuta/information/example/nothing.java">1.0 code</a>; here's the <a href="http://docs.rinet.ru:8080/Jtuta/information/example-1dot1/nothing.java">1.1 code</a>).  To run the <em>1.1</em> version of the applet, go to <a href="http://docs.rinet.ru:8080/Jtuta/information/example-1dot1/nothing.html"><code>example-1dot1/nothing.html</code></a>. For more information about running applets, refer to <a href="examples.html">About Our Examples</a>.<hr></blockquote>
<dt> <strong>JDK 1.1 Applets</strong>
<dd> These applets are included with an <code>&lt;APPLET&gt;</code> tag
     and appear directly in content pages.
     Some browsers still do not support 1.1.
     If your browser does not support 1.1,
     then you will not be able to run these applets.
	We run a 1.1 version of an applet only if
	no 1.0.2 version of the applet is available
	(usually because 1.0.2 doesn't support required functionality).
	These applets are followed by a note that looks like this:

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong> The above applet requires JDK 1.1. If you are using an older browser that does not support 1.1, you won't be able to run the applet. Instead, you need to view this page in a 1.1 browser, such as HotJava, the JDK Applet Viewer (<code>appletviewer</code>), or certain versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. For more information about running applets, refer to <a href="examples.html">About Our Examples</a>.<hr></blockquote>
<dt> <strong>JDK 1.2 Applets</strong>
<dd> These applets require Java Plug-in 1.2 or
     a 1.2 browser such as Applet Viewer.
     Because 1.2 support is not widely available
     and because we don't want to force people to download
     Java Plug-in if they can't or don't want to,
     1.2 applets aren't included directly in content pages.
     Instead, the content page contains a snapshot of the
     running applet, which links to a separate page that
     contains the applet.
	These applets are followed by a note that looks like this:

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong> Because the preceding applet uses the JDK 1.2 API, it requires Java Plug-in 1.2. It won't work with Java Plug-in 1.1.1, or Java Plug-in 1.1.2, or uncustomized 1.1 browsers. For more information about running applets in the tutorial, refer to <a href="examples.html">About Our Examples</a>. That page includes a section about <a href="examples.html#plugin">Downloading Java Plug-in</a>.<hr></blockquote>
<dt> <strong>Swing Applets</strong>
<dd> These applets require Java Plug-in 1.1.2,
     Java Plug-in 1.2,
     a 1.2 browser such as Applet Viewer,
     or a specially configured 1.1 browser.
     Because Swing support is not widely available
     and because we don't want to force people to download 
     Java Plug-in if they can't or don't want to,
     Swing applets aren't included directly in content pages.
     Instead, the content page contains a snapshot of the 
     running applet, which links to a separate page that 
     contains the applet. 

     For more information about running Swing applets, see
<a target="_top" href="..\uiswing\start\swingapplet.html">Running Swing Applets</a><a target="_top" href="..\uiswing\start\swingapplet.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/uiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Creating a User Interface trail)"></a>.
     <p>

     Swing applets are followed by a note that looks like this:

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong> Because the preceding applet uses the Swing 1.1 API, it requires Java Plug-in 1.1.2 or Java Plug-in 1.2. It won't work with Java Plug-in 1.1.1 or uncustomized 1.1 browsers. For more information about running applets in the tutorial, refer to <a href="examples.html">About Our Examples</a>. That page includes a section about <a href="examples.html#plugin">Downloading Java Plug-in</a>.<hr></blockquote>

<h4>Downloading Java Plug-in</h4>
</a>
<blockquote>
If you decide to download Java Plug-in,
choose the version you download carefully.
<p>
Download Java Plug-in 1.2 if you want to run
1.2 applets.
With Plug-in 1.2 you will be able to run 1.2 applets
as well as 1.1+Swing applets.
As of this writing, the tutorial
contains only one 1.2 applet: an example in
<a href="..\sound\playing.html">Playing Sounds</a>.
<p>
Most of the applets in the tutorial that require
Java Plug-in are 1.1+Swing applets.
If you care only to run these applets,
then download Java Plug-in 1.1.2.
Also, download Java Plug-in 1.1.2
if you are developing your own applets
under JDK 1.1 + Swing and want to test them.
<p>
To download Java Plug-in, visit the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/">
Java Plug-in</a> product page.
