<h2>
    An Overview of RMI Applications
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

RMI applications are often comprised of two separate programs: a server
and a client. A typical server application creates some remote objects,
makes references to them accessible, and waits for clients to invoke
methods on these remote objects. A typical client application gets a
remote reference to one or more remote objects in the server and then
invokes methods on them. RMI provides the mechanism by which the server
and the client communicate and pass information back and forth. Such an
application is sometimes referred to as a
<EM CLASS="Italic">distributed object application</EM>.
<P>
Distributed object applications need to
<UL>
<LI> <EM CLASS="10pt-bold">Locate remote objects</EM>:
     Applications can use one of two mechanisms to obtain references to
     remote objects. An application can register its remote objects
     with RMI's simple naming facility, the <CODE>rmiregistry</CODE>,
     or the application can pass and return remote object references as
     part of its normal operation.
<LI> <EM CLASS="10pt-bold">Communicate with remote objects</EM>:
     Details of communication between remote objects are handled by
     RMI; to the programmer, remote communication looks like a standard
     Java method invocation.
<LI> <EM CLASS="10pt-bold">Load class bytecodes for objects that are passed around</EM>:
     Because RMI allows a caller to pass objects to remote objects, RMI
     provides the necessary mechanisms for loading an object's code, as
     well as for transmitting its data.
</UL>


The following illustration depicts an RMI distributed application that
uses the registry to obtain a reference to a remote object. The server
calls the registry to associate (or bind) a name with a remote object.
The client looks up the remote object by its name in the server's
registry and then invokes a method on it. The illustration also shows
that the RMI system uses an existing Web server to load class
bytecodes, from server to client and from client to server, for objects
when needed.

<A NAME="advantages">
<H4>Advantages of Dynamic Code Loading</H4>
</a>
<blockquote>
One of the central and unique features of RMI is its ability to
download the <EM CLASS="Italic">bytecodes</EM> (or simply <EM
CLASS="Italic">code</EM>) of an object's class if the class is not
defined in the receiver's virtual machine. The types and the behavior
of an object, previously available only in a single virtual machine,
can be transmitted to another, possibly remote, virtual machine. RMI
passes objects by their true type, so the behavior of those objects is
not changed when they are sent to another virtual machine. This allows
new types to be introduced into a remote virtual machine, thus
extending the behavior of an application dynamically. The compute
engine example in this chapter uses RMI's capability to introduce new
behavior to a distributed program.
</blockquote>

<A NAME="remote">
<H4>Remote Interfaces, Objects, and Methods</H4>
</a>
<blockquote>
Like any other application, a distributed application built using Java
RMI is made up of interfaces and classes. The interfaces define
methods, and the classes implement the methods defined in the
interfaces and, perhaps, define additional methods as well. In a
distributed application some of the implementations are assumed to
reside in different virtual machines. Objects that have methods that
can be called across virtual machines are <EM CLASS="Italic">remote
objects</EM>.
<P>
An object becomes remote by implementing a <EM CLASS="Italic">remote
interface</EM>, which has the following characteristics.
<UL>
<LI> A remote interface extends the interface <CODE>java.rmi.Remote</CODE>. 
<LI> Each method of the interface declares
     <CODE>java.rmi.RemoteException</CODE> in its <CODE>throws</CODE>
     clause, in addition to any application-specific exceptions.
</UL>
<P>
RMI treats a remote object differently from a nonremote object when the
object is passed from one virtual machine to another. Rather than
making a copy of the implementation object in the receiving virtual
machine, RMI passes a remote <EM CLASS="Italic">stub</EM> for a remote
object. The stub acts as the local representative, or proxy, for the
remote object and basically <EM CLASS="Italic">is</EM>, to the caller,
the remote reference. The caller invokes a method on the local stub,
which is responsible for carrying out the method call on the remote
object.
<P>
A stub for a remote object implements the same set of remote interfaces
that the remote object implements. This allows a stub to be cast to any
of the interfaces that the remote object implements. However, this also
means that <EM CLASS="Italic">only</EM> those methods defined in a
remote interface are available to be called in the receiving virtual
machine.
</blockquote>

<A NAME="creating">
<H4>Creating Distributed Applications Using RMI</H4>
<blockquote>
When you use RMI to develop a distributed application,
you follow these general steps.
<OL>
<LI> Design and implement the components of your distributed application.
<LI> Compile sources and generate stubs.
<LI> Make classes network accessible.
<LI> Start the application.
</OL>

<H4> Design and Implement the Application Components</H4>
<blockquote>
First, decide on your application architecture and determine which
components are local objects and which ones should be remotely
accessible. This step includes:
<UL>
<LI> <EM CLASS="10pt-bold">Defining the remote interfaces</EM>:
     A remote interface specifies the methods that can be invoked
     remotely by a client. Clients program to remote interfaces, not to
     the implementation classes of those interfaces. Part of the design
     of such interfaces is the determination of any local objects that
     will be used as parameters and return values for these methods; if
     any of these interfaces or classes do not yet exist, you need to
     define them as well.
<LI> <EM CLASS="10pt-bold">Implementing the remote objects</EM>:
     Remote objects must implement one or more remote interfaces. The
     remote object class may include implementations of other
     interfaces (either local or remote) and other methods (which are
     available only locally). If any local classes are to be used as
     parameters or return values to any of these methods, they must be
     implemented as well.
<LI> <EM CLASS="10pt-bold">Implementing the clients</EM>:
     Clients that use remote objects can be implemented at any time
     after the remote interfaces are defined, including after the
     remote objects have been deployed.
</UL>
</blockquote>

<H4>Compile Sources and Generate Stubs</H4>
<blockquote>
This is a two-step process. In the first step you use the
<CODE>javac</CODE> compiler to compile the source files, which contain
the implementation of the remote interfaces and implementations, the
server classes, and the client classes. In the second step you use the
<CODE>rmic</CODE> compiler to create stubs for the remote objects. RMI
uses a remote object's stub class as a proxy in clients so that clients
can communicate with a particular remote object.
</blockquote>

<H4>Make Classes Network Accessible</H4>
<blockquote>
In this step you make everything--the class files associated with the
remote interfaces, stubs, and other classes that need to be downloaded
to clients--accessible via a Web server.
</blockquote>

<H4>Start the Application</H4>
<blockquote>
Starting the application includes running the RMI remote object
registry, the server, and the client.
<P>
The rest of this lesson walks through the steps to create a compute engine. 
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<A NAME="generic">
<H4>Building a Generic Compute Engine</H4>
<blockquote>
This trail focuses on a simple yet powerful distributed application
called a compute engine. The compute engine, a remote object in the
server, takes tasks from clients, runs them, and returns any results.
The tasks are run on the machine where the server is running. This sort
of distributed application could allow a number of client machines to
make use of a particularly powerful machine or one that has specialized
hardware.
<P>
The novel aspect of the compute engine is that the tasks it runs do not
need to be defined when the compute engine is written. New kinds of
tasks can be created at any time and then given to the compute engine
to be run. All that is required of a task is that its class implement a
particular interface. Such a task can be submitted to the compute
engine and run, even if the class that defines that task was written
long after the compute engine was written and started. The code needed
to accomplish the task can be downloaded by the RMI system to the
compute engine, and then the engine runs the task, using the resources
on the machine on which the compute engine is running.
<P>
The ability to perform arbitrary tasks is enabled by the dynamic nature
of the Java platform, which is extended to the network by RMI. RMI
dynamically loads the task code into the compute engine's Java virtual
machine and runs the task without prior knowledge of the class that
implements the task. An application like this, which has the ability to
download code dynamically, is often called a behavior-based
application. Such applications usually require full agent-enabled
infrastructures. With RMI such applications are part of the basic
mechanisms for distributed computing on the Java platform.
