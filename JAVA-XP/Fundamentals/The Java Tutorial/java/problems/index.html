<h1>
     Common Problems (and Their Solutions)
</h1>
<p>
<blockquote>


This section covers some common problems that you might encounter when
learning the Java language. After each problem is a list of possible
solutions.

<p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: The compiler complains that it can't find a class.
<ul>
<li>
Make sure you've imported the class or its package.
<li>
Unset the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, if it's set.
<li>
Make sure you're spelling the class name exactly the same way as it is
declared. Case matters!
<li>
If your classes are in packages, make sure that they appear in the
correct subdirectory as outlined in
<a href="..\more\managingfiles.html">Managing Source and Class Files</a>.
<li>
Also, some programmers use different names for the class name from the
<code>.java</code> filename. Make sure you're using the class name and not the
filename. In fact, make the names the same and you won't run into this
problem for this reason.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: The interpreter says it can't find one of my classes.
<ul>
<li>
Make sure you specified the class name--not the class file name--to the interpreter.
<li>
Unset the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, if it's set.
<li>
If your classes are in packages, make sure that they appear in the
correct subdirectory as outlined in
<a href="..\more\managingfiles.html">Managing Source and Class Files</a>.
<li>
Make sure you're invoking the interpreter from the directory in which
the <code>.class</code> file is located.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Problem</strong>: My program doesn't work! What's wrong with it?
<p>
The following is a list of common programming mistakes by novice Java
programmers. Make sure one of these isn't what's holding you back.
<ul>
<li>
Did you forget to use <code>break</code> after each <code>case</code>
statement in a <code>switch</code> statement?
<li>
Did you use the assignment operator <code>=</code> when you really
wanted to use the comparison operator <code>==</code>?
<li>
Are the termination conditions on your loops correct? Make sure you're
not terminating loops one iteration too early or too late. That is,
make sure you are using <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code>
and <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&gt;=</code> as appropriate for your
situation.
<li>
Remember that array indices begin at 0, so iterating over an array
looks like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++)
    . . .
</pre>
</blockquote>
<li>
Are you comparing floating-point numbers using <code>==</code>? Remember that floats
are approximations of the real thing. The greater than and less than (<code>&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;</code>) operators are more appropriate when conditional logic is
performed on floating-point numbers.
<li>
Are you having trouble with encapsulation, inheritance, or other
object-oriented programming and design concepts? Review the information
in
<a href="..\concepts\index.html">Object-Oriented Programming Concepts</a>.
<li>
Make sure that blocks of statements are enclosed in curly brackets <code>{ }</code>.
The following code looks right because of indentation, but it doesn't
do what the indents imply because the brackets are missing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfInts.length; i++)
    arrayOfInts[i] = i;
    System.out.println("[i] = " + arrayOfInts[i]);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<li>
Are you using the correct conditional operator? Make sure you
understand <code>&&</code> and <code>||</code> and are using them appropriately.
<li>
Do you use the negation operator ! a lot? Try to express conditions
without it. Doing so is less confusing and error-prone.
<li>
Are you using a <code>do</code>-<code>while</code>? If so, do you know
that the loop executes one more time than a similar <code>while</code> loop?
<li>
Are you trying to change the value of an argument from a method?
Arguments in Java are passed by value and can't be changed in a
method.
<li>
Did you inadvertently add an extra semicolon (<code>;</code>), thereby
terminating a statement prematurely? Notice the extra semicolon at the
end of this for statement:
<blockquote>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; arrayOfInts.length; i++) ;
    arrayOfInts[i] = i;
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ul>
