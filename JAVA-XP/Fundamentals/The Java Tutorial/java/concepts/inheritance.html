<h2>
    What Is Inheritance?
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Generally speaking, objects are defined in terms of classes. You know a lot
about an object by knowing its class. Even if you don't know what a penny-farthing
is, if I told you it was a bicycle, you would know that it had two wheels,
handle bars, and pedals.
<p>
Object-oriented systems take this a step further and allow classes to be defined
in terms of other classes. For example, mountain bikes, racing bikes, and tandems are
all different kinds of bicycles. In object-oriented terminology,
mountain bikes, racing bikes, and tandems are all <em>subclasses</em> of the
bicycle class. Similarly, the bicycle class is the <em>superclass</em> of
mountain bikes, racing bikes, and tandems.

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/java/8bike.gif" WIDTH="364" HEIGHT="281" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
Each subclass <em>inherits</em> state (in the form of variable declarations) from
the superclass. Mountain bikes, racing bikes, and tandems share some states:
cadence, speed, and the like. Also, each subclass inherits methods from
the superclass. Mountain bikes, racing bikes, and tandems share some behaviors:
braking and changing pedaling speed, for example.
<p>
However, subclasses are not limited to the state and behaviors provided to them
by their superclass. What would be the point in that? Subclasses can add
variables and methods to the ones they inherit from the superclass.
Tandem bicycles have two seats and two sets of handle bars; some mountain bikes
have an extra set of gears with a lower gear ratio.
<p>
Subclasses can also <em>override</em> inherited methods and provide specialized
implementations for those methods. For example, if you had a mountain bike with
an extra set of gears, you would override the "change gears" method so that the
rider could actually use those new gears.
<p>
You are not limited to just one layer of inheritance. The inheritance tree,
or <em>class hierarchy</em>, can be as deep as needed. Methods and variables
are inherited down through the levels. In general, the further down in the hierarchy a
class appears, the more specialized its behavior.

<h4>The Benefits of Inheritance</h4>
<ul>

<li>
Subclasses provide specialized behaviors from the basis of common elements
provided by the superclass. Through the use of inheritance, programmers can reuse
the code in the superclass many times.

<li>
Programmers can implement superclasses called <em>abstract classes</em>
that define "generic" behaviors.
The abstract superclass defines and may partially implement the behavior
but much of the class is undefined and unimplemented. Other
programmers fill in the details with specialized subclasses.

</ul>
