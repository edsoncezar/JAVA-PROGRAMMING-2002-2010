<h2>
    Variables and Data Types
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
 
Variables are the nouns of a programming language-that is,
they are the entities (values and data) that act or are acted upon.
The <code>countChars</code> method defines two variables--
<code>count</code> and <code>in</code>.
The program increments <code>count</code> each time it reads
a character from the other variable <code>in</code>.
The declarations for both variables appear in bold in the following listing:
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.io.*;
public class Count {
    public static void countChars(<strong>Reader in</strong>) throws IOException
    {
        <strong>int count = 0;</strong>

        while (in.read() != -1)
            count++;
        System.out.println("Counted " + count + " chars.");
    }
    // <em>... main method omitted ...</em>
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
A variable declaration always contains two components:
the type of the variable and its name.
The location of the variable declaration, that is,
where the declaration appears in relation to other code elements,
determines its scope. 

<h4>Data Types</h4>
<blockquote>
All variables in the Java language must have a data type.
A variable's data type determines the values
that the variable can contain and the operations that can be performed on it.
For example, the declaration <code>int count</code>
declares that <code>count</code> is an integer (<code>int</code>).
Integers can contain only integral values (both positive and negative),
and you can use the standard arithmetic operators
(<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>)
on integers to perform the standard arithmetic operations
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively).
<p>
There are two major categories of data types in the Java language:
<em>primitive</em> and <em>reference</em>.
The following table lists, by keyword,
all of the primitive data types supported by Java,
their sizes and formats, and a brief description of each.

<strong>Purity Tip:</strong>
In other languages,
the format and size of primitive data types
may depend on the platform on which a program is running.
In contrast, the Java language specifies the size and format
of its primitive data types.
Hence, you don't have to worry about system-dependencies.
<hr>
<p>
A variable of primitive type contains a single value
of the appropriate size and format for its type:
a number, character, or boolean value.
For example, the value of an <code>int</code> is an integer,
the value of a <code>char</code> is a 16-bit Unicode character,
and so on.
The value of the <code>count</code>
variable in <code>countChars</code>
ranges from its initial value of zero
to a number that represents the number of characters in the input.

<p>
Arrays, classes, and interfaces are reference types.
The value of a reference type variable,
in contrast to that of a primitive type,
is a reference to the actual value
or set of values represented by the variable.
A reference is like your friend's address:
The address is not your friend,
but it's a way to reach your friend.
A reference type variable is not the array or object itself
but rather a way to reach it.
<p>
The <code>countChars</code> method uses one variable of reference type,
<code>in</code>, which is a <code>Reader</code> object.
When used in a statement or expression,
the name <code>in</code> evaluates to a reference to the object.
So you can use the object's name to access its member variables
or call its methods
(just as <code>countChars</code> does to call <code>read</code>). 

<p>
<hr>
<strong>Note to C and C++ Programmers:</strong>
There are three <a href=datatypes.html>C Data Types Not Supported By the Java Language</a>.
They are pointer, struct, and union. These data types are not necessary in Java;
you use classes and objects instead.
<hr>
</blockquote>

<h4>Variable Names</h4>
<blockquote>
A program refers to a variable's value by its name. For example, when the
<code>countChars</code> method wants to refer to the value of the <code>count</code>
variable, it simply uses the name <code>count</code>.
<p>
In Java, the following must hold true for a variable name
<ol>
<li>
It must be a legal Java identifier comprised of a series of Unicode 
characters. Unicode is a character-coding system designed to
support text written in diverse human languages. It allows
for the codification of up to 65,536 characters, currently 34,168
have been assigned. This allows you to use characters in your
Java programs from various alphabets, such as Japanese, Greek,
Cyrillic, and Hebrew. This is important so that programmers
can write code that is meaningful in their native languages.
<li>
It must not be a <a href="keywords.html">keyword</a>
or a boolean literal (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>).
<li>
It must not have the same name as another variable whose declaration appears
in the same scope.
</ol>

<hr>
<strong>By Convention:</strong>
Variable names begin with a lowercase letter
and class names begin with an uppercase letter.
If a variable name consists of more than one word,
such as isVisible, the words are joined together
and each word after the first begins with an uppercase letter.
<hr>
<p>

Rule #3 implies that variables may have the same name as another variable
whose declaration appears in a different scope. This is true. In addition,
in some situations, a variable may share names with another variable which
is declared in a nested scope. Scope is covered in the next section.
</blockquote>

<h4>Scope</h4>
<blockquote>
A variable's scope is the block of code within which the variable is
accessible and determines when the variable is
created and destroyed.
The location of the variable declaration
within your program establishes its scope
and places it into one of these four categories:
<ul>
<li> Member variable
<li> Local variable
<li> Method parameter
<li> Exception-handler parameter
</ul>


<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/java/9parts.gif" WIDTH="439" HEIGHT="349" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
A member variable is a member of a class or an object. It can be declared 
anywhere in a class but not in a method.
The member is available to all code in the class. 
The <code>Count</code>
class declares no member variables.
For information about declaring member variables, refer to
<a target="_top" href="..\javaoo\variables.html">Declaring Member Variables</a><a href="..\javaoo\variables.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a> in the next lesson.
<p>
You can declare local variables anywhere
in a method or within a block of code in a method.
In <code>countChars</code>, <code>count</code> is a local variable.
The scope of <code>count</code>, that is, the code that can access
<code>count</code>,
extends from the declaration of <code>count</code>
to the end of the <code>countChars</code> method
(indicated by the first right curly bracket <code>}</code>
that appears in the program code).
In general, a local variable is accessible
from its declaration to the end of the code block in which it was declared.
<p>

Method parameters are formal arguments to methods and constructors and are
used to pass values into methods. The discussion about
writing methods in the next lesson,
<a target="_top" href="..\javaoo\methods.html">Implementing Methods</a><a href="..\javaoo\methods.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a>, talks about passing values into methods
through parameters.
You can also pass values into constructors in the same manner,
so the discussion regarding method parameters applies equally well
to parameters to constructors.
In <code>countChars</code>,
<code>in</code> is a parameter to the <code>countChars</code> method.
The scope of a method parameter is the entire method for
which it is a parameter. So, in <code>countChars</code>,
the scope of <code>in</code>
is the entire <code>countChars</code> method.
<p>
Exception-handler parameters are similar to method parameters but are
arguments to an exception handler rather than to a method or a constructor.
The <code>countChars</code> method does not have any exception handlers, so it
doesn't have any exception-handler parameters.
<a target="_top" href="..\..\essential\exceptions\index.html">Handling Errors with Exceptions</a><a href="..\..\essential\exceptions\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a> talks about using Java exceptions to handle errors and shows you
how to write an exception handler that has a parameter.
</blockquote>

<h4>Variable Initialization</h4>
<blockquote>
Local variables and member variables can be initialized
with an assignment statement when they're declared.
The data type of both sides of the assignment statement must match.
The <code>countChars</code> method provides an initial value
of zero for <code>count</code> when declaring it:
<blockquote>
<pre>
int count <strong>= 0</strong>;
</pre>
</blockquote>
The value assigned to the variable must match the variable's type.
<p>
Method parameters and exception-handler parameters cannot be initialized
in this way. The value for a parameter is set by the caller.
</blockquote>

<h4>Final Variables</h4>
<blockquote>
You can declare a variable in any scope to be final,
including parameters to methods and constructors.
The value of a final variable cannot change after it has been initialized.
<p>
To declare a final variable,
use the <code>final</code> keyword in the variable declaration
before the type:
<blockquote>
<pre>
final int aFinalVar = 0;
</pre>
</blockquote>
The previous statement declares a final variable and initializes it,
all at once.
Subsequent attempts to assign a value to <code>aFinalVar</code>
result in a compiler error.
You may, if necessary, defer initialization of a final variable.
Simply declare the variable and initialize it later, like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
final int blankfinal;
. . .
blankfinal = 0;
</pre>
</blockquote>
A final variable that has been declared
but not yet initialized is called a blank final.
Again, once a final variable has been initialized it cannot be set
and any later attempts to assign a value
to <code>blankfinal</code> result in a compile-time error.
