<blockquote>

Until now, the lessons and examples in this tutorial have documented
the Java language and platform as they exist in the JDK 1.1 release.
While this snapshot approach provides new Java programmers a clear path
to learning, it ignores the history and future of the language and
API.
<p>
This trail steps back and looks at the JDK 1.1 release in the light of
what came before and what is likely to come after. This wide-angle
perspective can help you make decisions about your Java development.
<p>
First, this trail discusses how 1.1 differs from 1.0. Then it moves
into how and when to upgrade your programs from 1.0 to 1.1. Finally,
the end of this trail includes a preview of the next major release of
the JDK, which is likely to be called JDK 1.2.
<p>
The sources for much of this trail were collected documents written by
various Java team members. We are indebted to our colleagues.

<strong>Note</strong>:
Since the JDK 1.1 release shipped in December 1996, Sun has made
several bug-fix releases. Bug-fix releases don't generally add new
features, but they might enable functionality that was impossible
before due to bugs. For example, the JDK 1.1.2 release has the same
API as JDK 1.1, but lightweight components work much better in 1.1.2
and subsequent releases.

<b>What's New in 1.1?</b></a>
provides a summary of new features for JDK 1.1. This might be your
first stop if you used 1.0. Even if you didn't use 1.0, you might find
this lesson handy as an overview of many of the capabilities that the
JDK provides.

 border=0><b>Migrating to 1.1</b></a> 
is the place to go if you developed programs for JDK 1.0, and you're
wondering how and when to upgrade them. This lesson provides specific
information about the API that changed from 1.0 to 1.1 and gives tips
about how to migrate your 1.0 code to 1.1.

 border=0><b>A Preview of Things to Come</b></a>
describes the features we expect the next major release of the JDK to
contain. Some of the most eagerly awaited 1.2 features are in the Java
Foundation Classes (JFC), which extend the GUI capabilities provided by
the Java platform. This lesson tells you where to find information on
getting 1.1-compatible versions of the new JFC components.
