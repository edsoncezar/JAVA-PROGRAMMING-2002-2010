<h2>
    Threads Changes
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The <code>Thread.stop</code>, <code>Thread.suspend</code>, and
<code>Thread.resume</code> methods will be deprecated in the next
major release of the JDK.

<p>
<code>Thread.stop</code> is being deprecated because
it is inherently unsafe. Stopping a thread causes it to unlock all
the monitors that it has locked. (The monitors are unlocked as the
<code>ThreadDeath</code> exception propagates up the stack.)  If any of the
objects previously protected by these monitors were in an inconsistent state,
other threads may now view these objects in an inconsistent state.
Such objects are said to be <i>damaged</i>.
When threads operate on damaged objects, arbitrary behavior can result.
This behavior may be subtle and difficult to detect, or it may be
pronounced.  Unlike other unchecked exceptions,
<code>ThreadDeath</code> kills threads silently; thus, the user has no
warning that the program may be corrupted.  The corruption can manifest
itself at any time after the actual damage occurs, even hours or days in the
future.

<p>
This tutorial has always recommended against using <code>Thread.stop</code>.
So, hopefully, this change will not affect your programs.
<p>
If however, you 've been using <code>Thread.stop</code> in your programs,
you should substitute that use with code that provides for a gentler termination.
Most uses of <code>stop</code> can and should be replaced by code that simply
modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should stop
running.  The target thread should check this variable regularly, and return
from its run method in an orderly fashion if the variable indicates that it is
to stop running.
<P>
For example, suppose your applet contains the following 
<code>start</code>, <code>stop</code> and <code>run</code> methods:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void start() {
    blinker = new Thread(this);
    blinker.start();
}

public void stop() {
    blinker.stop();  // UNSAFE!
}

public void run() {
    Thread thisThread = Thread.currentThread();
    while (true) {
        try {
	    Thread.sleep(interval);
        } catch (InterruptedException e){
        }
        repaint();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
You can avoid the use of <code>Thread.stop</code> by replacing
the applet's <code>stop</code> and <code>run</code> methods with:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void stop() {
    blinker = null;
}

public void run() {
    Thread thisThread = Thread.currentThread();
    while (blinker == thisThread) {
        try {
	    Thread.sleep(interval);
        } catch (InterruptedException e){
        }
        repaint();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<code>Thread.suspend</code> is inherently deadlock-prone so it is also
being deprecated, thereby necessitating the deprecation of <code>Thread.resume</code>.
If the target thread holds a lock on the monitor protecting a critical system resource when
it is suspended, no thread can access this resource until the target thread
is resumed. If the thread that would resume the target thread attempts to
lock this monitor prior to calling <code>resume</code>, deadlock results.
Such deadlocks typically manifest themselves as "frozen" processes.
<P>
As with <code>Thread.stop</code>, the prudent approach is to have the
"target thread" poll a variable indicating the desired state of the 
thread (active or suspended).  When the desired state is suspended,
the thread waits using <code>Object.wait</code>.  When the thread is
resumed, the target thread is notified using <code>Object.notify</code>.
<P>
For example, suppose your applet contains the following mousePressed event
handler, which toggles the state of a thread called <code>blinker</code>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
    e.consume();

    if (threadSuspended)
        blinker.resume();
    else
        blinker.suspend();  // DEADLOCK-PRONE!

    threadSuspended = !threadSuspended;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
You can avoid the use of <code>Thread.suspend</code> and
<code>Thread.resume</code> by replacing the event handler above with:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public synchronized void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
    e.consume();

    threadSuspended = !threadSuspended;

    if (!threadSuspended)
        notify();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
and adding the following code to the "run loop":
<blockquote>
<pre>
synchronized(this) {
    while (threadSuspended)
	wait();
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The <code>wait</code> method throws the <code>InterruptedException</code>, so
it must be inside a <code>try ... catch</code> clause.  It's fine
to put it in the same clause as the <code>sleep</code>.  The check should
follow (rather than precede) the <code>sleep</code> so the window is
immediately repainted when the the thread is "resumed."  The resulting
<code>run</code> method follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public void run() {
    while (true) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(interval);

            synchronized(this) {
                while (threadSuspended)
                    wait();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e){
        }
        repaint();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Note that the <code>notify</code> in the <code>mousePressed</code> method and
the <code>wait</code> in the <code>run</code> method are inside
<code>synchronized</code> blocks.  This is required by the language, and
ensures that <code>wait</code> and <code>notify</code> are properly
serialized.  In practical terms, this eliminates race conditions that could
cause the "suspended" thread to miss a <code>notify</code> and remain
suspended.

<strong>Note:</strong>
Don't wait for the next major release of the JDK.
These are changes that you can make to improve your programs NOW!
