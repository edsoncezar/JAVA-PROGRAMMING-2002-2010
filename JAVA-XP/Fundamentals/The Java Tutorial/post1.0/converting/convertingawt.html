<h2>
    How to Convert Code that Uses the AWT
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

Why should you update a 1.0 program to the 1.1 AWT API? 
Here are five possible reasons:

<ul>
<li> The 1.1 version of AWT has some new features you want to use.
     See <a href="..\whatsnew\awt.html">AWT Enhancements</a>
     for a summary of new features.
<li> The new AWT architecture enables faster, more robust
     implementations of the AWT,
     which means that the updated program might work better.
<li> You plan to use the Swing components,
     which rely on the new event architecture.
     See 
<a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\components\index.html">Using Swing Components</a><a target="_top" href="..\..\uiswing\components\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/uiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Creating a User Interface trail)"></a>     for information on the Swing components.
<li> The program is one of the rare ones 
     that is affected by incompatible AWT changes.
     You can find a list of possibly incompatible bug fixes
     in the document
     <a href="incompatiblechangesawt.html">Incompatible Changes 
     in the 1.1 AWT API</a>.
<li> You want the 1.1 Java compiler to 
     compile the program without deprecation warnings.
</ul>

<p>

Converting a 1.0 program to the 1.1 AWT API
usually requires two steps:
<ol>
<li> Replace deprecated methods with their 1.1 equivalents.
<li> Convert the program's event-handling code
     to use the new AWT event system.
</ol>

The following two sections describe each step in detail,
and then give an example.

<h4>
<a name=sed>
Step 1: Replace Deprecated Methods with Their 1.1 Equivalents
</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
Because so many methods were deprecated
JavaSoft provides a script 
to help you convert 1.0 programs to the 1.1 versions.
This script, called <code>updateAWT</code>,
uses on a UNIX utility called <code>sed</code>
to change the names of many deprecated 1.0 AWT methods
into their 1.1 equivalents.
If you're developing on a PC,
you might be able to run the script using a product
such as MKS Toolkit, 
which provides PC versions of UNIX tools.
For instructions, see 
<a href="_updateawt.html">Platform-specific Details:
Using the <code>updateAWT</code> Script</a>. 

<p>

You'll probably have to make some changes by hand,
whether or not you use the
<code>updateAWT</code> script.
As described in
<a href="converting.html">How to Convert Your Program</a>,
you can get a list of the deprecated methods in the program
by compiling its files with the 
<code>-deprecation</code> flag.

<p>

Once you know which deprecated methods the program uses,
look up each method in the section
<a href="deprecatedawt.html">Alternatives to Deprecated Methods
in the AWT</a>.
Then replace each deprecated method 
with its 1.1 alternative.
Most of the changes you need to make are straightforward,
except those to event-handling code,
which are described in the next section.

</blockquote>
<h4>
<a name=events>
Step 2: Convert Event-Handling Code
</a>
</h4>
<blockquote>

In 1.0,
the <code>Component handleEvent</code> method
(along with the methods it called, such as <code>action</code>)
was the center of event handling.  Only
<code>Component</code> objects could handle events, and the component that handled
an event had to be either the component in which the event occurred or a
component above it in the component containment hierarchy.

<p>

In 1.1,
event handling is no longer restricted
to objects in the component containment hierarchy,
and the <code>handleEvent</code> method
is no longer the center of event handling.
Instead, objects of any type can register as
event listeners.  Event listeners receive notification only about the
types of events they've registered their interest in.  Never again will you
have to create a <code>Component</code> subclass just to handle events.

<p>

When upgrading to the 1.1 release,
the simplest way to convert event-handling code
is to leave it in the same class,
making that class a listener for that type of event.
That's the scheme that this section illustrates.

<p>

Another possibility is to centralize event-handling code
in one or more non-<code>Component</code> listeners.
This approach lets you separate the GUI of your program
from implementation details.
It requires that you modify your existing code 
so that the listeners can get whatever state information
they require from the components.
This approach can be worth your while
if you're trying to keep your program's architecture clean.

<p>

We recommend that you do <em>not</em> mix
the 1.0 event model 
with the 1.1 event model in the same program.
The results would be unpredictable
and might be difficult to debug.

<p>

For more information about 1.1 event handling,
see <a href="..\..\uiswing\overview\event.html">Event Handling</a>.

<h4>
<a name=listener>
Making a <code>Component</code> a Listener
</a>
</h4>

The process of making a <code>Component</code> a listener
can be straightforward,
once you figure out which events a program handles
and which components generate the events.
If you're using a Java compiler from JDK 1.1.1 or later,
then compiling with the <code>-deprecation</code> flag
generates a list 
that includes all old-style event handling methods.
(Before 1.1.1, the compiler didn't generate a complete list,
so you had to search for "Event" in a source file.)
While you're looking at the code,
you should note whether any classes
exist solely for the purpose
of handling events;
you might be able to eliminate such classes.

<p>

Here are the steps to follow
when converting a 1.0 component 
into a listener:

<ol>
<li> Figure out which components generate each event type.
     The <a href="eventconversion.html">Event-Conversion Table</a>
     can help you know what to look for.
     For example, if you're converting event code
     that's in an <code>action</code> method,
     the table tells you to look for
     <code>Button</code>,
     <code>List</code>,
     <code>MenuItem</code>,
     <code>TextField</code>,
     <code>Checkbox</code>, and
     <code>Choice</code> objects.
<p>
<li> By looking up each event type in 
     the <a href="eventconversion.html">Event-Conversion Table</a>,
     note which listener interfaces
     the listener should implement,
     and which methods within each interface
     should contain event-handling code.
     For example, if you're trying to handle an action event
     generated by a <code>Button</code>,
     the table
     tells you to implement 
     the <code>ActionListener</code> interface,
     putting the event-handling code 
     in the <code>actionPerformed</code> method
<p>
<li>
     Change the class declaration
     so that the class imports the necessary types
     and implements the appropriate listener interfaces:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>import java.awt.event.*;</b>
...
public class MyClass extends SomeComponent
                     <b>implements ActionListener</b> {
</pre>
</blockquote>

<strong>Alternative:</strong>
Instead of implementing an interface, 
you can declare an inner class
that extends an event adapter class.
Inner classes are useful 
when you need to implement only one method
of an interface,
but the interface contains many other methods.
See
<a href="..\..\uiswing\events\generalrules.html#innerclasses">
Using Adapters and Inner Classes to Handle AWT Events</a>
for more information.

<p>
<li> Create empty implementations of all the methods
     in the listener interfaces your class must implement.
     Copy the event-handling code
     into the appropriate methods.
     For example, 
     <code>ActionListener</code> has just one method,
     <code>actionPerformed</code>.
     So as a shortcut way of creating
     the new method 
     and copying the event-handling code to it, 
     you can simply change the signature
     of an <code>action</code> method from this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
public boolean action(Event event, Object arg) {
</pre>
</blockquote>
     to this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent <em>event</em>) {</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alternative:</strong>
If you use an adapter subclass to handle the events,
you don't need to create empty implementations of methods.
See
<a href="..\..\uiswing\events\generalrules.html#innerclasses">
Using Adapters and Inner Classes to Handle AWT Events</a>
for more information.

<p>
<li> Modify the event-handling code in these ways:
     <ul>
     <li> Delete all <code>return</code> statements.
     <li> Change references to <code><em>event</em>.target</code>
	  to be <code><em>event</em>.getSource()</code>.
     <li> Delete any code that unnecessarily tests for 
	  which component the event came from.
	  Now that events are forwarded
	  only if the generating component has a listener,
	  you don't have to worry about receiving events
	  from an unwanted component.
     <li> Perform any other modifications required
          to make the program compile cleanly and execute correctly.
     </ul>

<p>
<li> Determine where the components that generate the events are created.
     Just after the code that creates each one,
     register <code>this</code> as the appropriate type of listener.
     For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b><em>newComponentObject</em>.addActionListener(this);</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<strong>Alternative:</strong>
If you use an inner class to handle the events,
register an instance of that inner class instead.
See
<a href="..\..\uiswing\events\generalrules.html#innerclasses">
Using Adapters and Inner Classes to Handle AWT Events</a>
for more information.

<p>
<li> Compile and test your program.
     If your program is ignoring some events,
     make sure you added the correct event-listener object
     as a listener to the correct event-generating object.
</ol>

<h4>
<a name=example>
Example: Converting DialogWindow
</a>
</h4>

This section shows how to convert a program called DialogWindow
from the 1.0 API to the 1.1 API.
DialogWindow is an application,
but it can also run as an applet,
with the help of a class named <code>AppletButton</code>.
The DialogWindow program is
featured in the section 
<a href="..\..\uiswing\components\dialog.html">How
to Use Dialogs</a>.


<p>

<h4>
Step 1: Replace Deprecated Methods with Their 1.1 Equivalents
</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Move the 1.0 source and bytecode files to a safe place,
keeping a copy of the source file that you can modify.
For example, on a UNIX system:
<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>mkdir 1.0example</b>
% <b>mv DialogWindow.class 1.0example</b>
% <b>cp DialogWindow.java 1.0example</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>
Perform as much automatic conversion as possible.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>updateAWT DialogWindow.java &gt; tmp.java</b>
% <b>diff DialogWindow.java tmp.java</b>
33c33
&lt;         dialog.show();
---
&gt;         dialog.setVisible(true);
38c38
&lt;         textArea.appendText(text + "\n");
---
&gt;         textArea.append(text + "\n");
47c47
&lt;         window.show();
---
&gt;         window.setVisible(true);
87c87
&lt;         hide();
---
&gt;         setVisible(false);
% <b>mv tmp.java DialogWindow.java</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>
Compile DialogWindow,
making sure to use the 1.1 compiler.
For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>which javac</b>
/usr/local/java/jdk1.1.1/solaris/bin/javac
% <b>javac DialogWindow.java</b>
Note: DialogWindow.java uses a deprecated API.  Recompile with
"-deprecation" for details.
1 warning
%
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<pre>
% <b>javac -deprecation DialogWindow.java</b>
DialogWindow.java:18: Note: The method boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event) in
class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class DialogWindow overrides
it.
    public boolean handleEvent(Event event) {
                   ^
DialogWindow.java:26: Note: The method boolean handleEvent(java.awt.Event) in
class java.awt.Component has been deprecated.
        return super.handleEvent(event);
                                ^
DialogWindow.java:29: Note: The method boolean action(java.awt.Event,
java.lang.Object) in class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class
DialogWindow overrides it.
    public boolean action(Event event, Object arg) {
                   ^
DialogWindow.java:81: Note: The method boolean action(java.awt.Event,
java.lang.Object) in class java.awt.Component has been deprecated, and class
SimpleDialog overrides it.
    public boolean action(Event event, Object arg) {
                   ^
Note: DialogWindow.java uses a deprecated API.  Please consult the
documentation for a better alternative.
5 warnings

</pre>
</blockquote>

As you can see,
the example compiles successfully.
However, a few calls or overrides of deprecated methods remain.
The <code>Event</code> arguments to these methods
are a tell-tale sign that the methods contain event-handling code.

<p>

<h4>
Step 2: Convert Event-Handling Code
</h4>

<p>

To convert DialogWindow,
follow the sequence described previously in
<a href=#listener>Making a Component a Listener</a>.

<p>
<ol>
<li> The first and hardest task
     is determining which components generate events
     that must be handled.
     Compiling with the <code>-deprecation</code> flag
     tells us that DialogWindow has three 1.0-style event-handling methods:
     <ul>
     <li> <code>DialogWindow.handleEvent</code>
     <li> <code>DialogWindow.action</code>
     <li> <code>SimpleDialog.action</code>
     </ul>

     <p>

     Studying DialogWindow's code tells us these things
     about its event handling architecture:
     <p>
     <ul>
     <li> <code>DialogWindow</code> handles window destroy events
          for itself.
     <li> <code>DialogWindow</code> handles action events
          for the components it contains.
          Upon closer inspection, 
          we can see that it contains only one component 
          that can generate action events: a <code>Button</code>.
     <li> <code>SimpleDialog</code> handles action events 
          for the components it contains.
          Upon closer inspection, 
          we can see that it contains three components
          that can generate action events:
          two <code>Button</code>s (Cancel and Set)
          and a <code>TextField</code>.
     <li> Both <code>DialogWindow</code> and <code>SimpleDialog</code> 
          contain non-event-handling code,
          so you can't eliminate them
          by moving their event-handling code elsewhere.
     </ul>

     <p>

<li>
Now that we know which objects generate which events,
it's easy to determine which interfaces
the event handlers should implement.
Consulting the
<a href="eventconversion.html">Event-Conversion Table</a>
tells us that WINDOW_DESTROY
corresponds to the <code>windowClosing</code> method
of <code>WindowListener</code>,
and that action events generated by buttons and text fields
are handled by the <code>actionPerformed</code> method 
of <code>ActionListener</code>.

<p>

<li>
Now all that's left is to implement the event-handling methods
and register the event listener.
The following example gives the highlights of the event-related code
converted DialogWindow program.
Significant changes are in <b>bold</b>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>import java.awt.event.*;</b>

public class DialogWindow extends Frame 
			  <b>implements WindowListener,
				     ActionListener</b> {
    ...
    public DialogWindow() {
	...
        Button button = new Button("Click to bring up dialog");
	<b>button.addActionListener(this);</b>
	...
	<b>addWindowListener(this);</b>
    }

    <b>public void windowClosed(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowIconified(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowActivated(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowOpened(WindowEvent event) {
    }

    public void windowClosing(WindowEvent event) {</b>
        if (inAnApplet) {
            dispose();
        } else {
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }

    <b>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {</b>
        if (dialog == null) {
            dialog = new SimpleDialog(this, "A Simple Dialog");
        }
        dialog.setVisible();
    }
    ...
}

class SimpleDialog extends Dialog <b>implements ActionListener</b> {
    ...
    SimpleDialog(Frame dw, String title) {
	...
        field = new TextField(40);
	<b>field.addActionListener(this);</b>
	...
        Button b = new Button("Cancel");
	<b>b.addActionListener(this);</b>
        setButton = new Button("Set");
	<b>setButton.addActionListener(this);</b>
	...
    }

    <b>public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {</b>
	<b>Object source = event.getSource();</b>
        if ( (source == setButton)
           | (source == field)) {
            parent.setText(field.getText());
        }
        field.selectAll();
        setVisible(false);
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Instead of implementing the <code>WindowListener</code> interface,
<code>DialogWindow</code> could simply contain an inner class
that extends <code>WindowAdapter.</code> 
This change makes the empty method bodies unnecessary.

<p>

The following are the highlights of 
a <code>DialogWindow</code> class
that uses an inner class to handle window events.
Significant changes from the 1.1 window listener version
are in <b>bold</b>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
public class DialogWindow extends Frame 
			  <b>implements ActionListener {</b>
    ...
    public DialogWindow() {
	...
        Button button = new Button("Click to bring up dialog");
	button.addActionListener(this);
	...
	<b>addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent event) {
                if (inAnApplet) {
                    dispose();
                } else {
                    System.exit(0);
                }
	    }
	});</b>
    }

    <b>...//No empty windowXXX method implementations!...</b>

    ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ol>

By using the DialogWindow program,
both as an applet and as an application,
we can see that it handles all events properly.
