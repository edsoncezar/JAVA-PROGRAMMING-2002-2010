<h2>
    How to Convert Code that Uses I/O
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>


To support internationalization, 
the JDK 1.1 release adds character streams 
to the <code>java.io</code> package.
In addition, 
a few of the package's classes and methods have been deprecated.
Converting a 1.0 program that uses <code>java.io</code> API
usually requires two steps:
<ol>
<li> If the program uses a byte stream to read or write data,
     decide whether the byte stream is still appropriate
     for the data being read or written by the program.
     If not, convert the program so that it uses a character stream instead.
<li> Make sure that the program does not use any deprecated API.
</ol>

The following two sections provide details and examples to help
you with these two steps.

<h4>Step 1: If Appropriate, Switch from Byte Streams to Character Streams</h4>
<blockquote>
Does the program use a byte stream
(an object that inherits from 
<code>InputStream</code> or <code>OutputStream</code>)?
If so, does the stream truly contain byte data,
or does it contain characters?
If the stream contains characters,
then you should seriously consider
changing the program to use character streams, 
which were introduced in 1.1.

<p>

Character streams act like byte streams
except that they contain
16-bit Unicode characters rather than 8-bit bytes.
With character streams,
you can write programs that don't
depend upon a specific character encoding,
and are therefore easy to internationalize.

<p>
Another advantage of character streams is that they are potentially much
more efficient than byte streams. The implementations of many of Java's
original byte streams are oriented around byte-at-a-time read and write
operations. The character-stream classes, in contrast, are oriented around
buffer-at-a-time read and write operations. This difference, in combination
with a more efficient locking scheme, allows the character stream classes to
make up for the added overhead of encoding conversion in many cases.

<p>

Character streams
are implemented by the 
<code>java.io</code> 
<code>Reader</code> and <code>Writer</code> classes and
their subclasses.
The character-stream classes support
essentially the same operations as the byte-stream classes,
except that where byte-stream methods
operate on bytes or byte arrays, character-stream methods operate on
characters, character arrays, or strings.

<p>
Although the Java language stores strings in Unicode, 
typical user-readable text files use encodings that are not
necessarily related to Unicode, or even to ASCII.
Character streams hide the complexity of dealing with these
encodings by providing two classes that serve as bridges between byte streams
and character streams.  The
<code>InputStreamReader</code>
class implements a character-input stream that reads bytes from a byte-input
stream and converts them to characters according to a specified encoding.
Similarly, the <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>
class implements a character-output stream that converts characters into bytes
according a specified encoding and writes them to a byte-output stream.

<p>
Most of the functionality available for byte streams is also provided for
character streams. This is reflected in the name of each character-stream
class, whose prefix is usually shared with the name of the corresponding
byte-stream class. For example, there is a
<code>PushbackReader</code> class
that provides the same functionality for character streams that is provided by
<code>PushbackInputStream</code> for byte streams.
See
<a href="charvsbytestreams.html">Character Streams versus Byte Streams</a>
for a list of the character-stream classes
and their corresponding byte-stream classes.

</blockquote>

<h4>Step 2: Remove Calls to Deprecated Classes and Methods</h4>
<blockquote>
Of the two classes and five methods
that were deprecated in <code>java.io</code>,
only one seems to give programmers trouble: <code>DataInputStream</code>'s
<code>readLine</code> method. This section talks about the alternatives
to this method and provides examples.
For alternatives to the other classes and methods that
were deprecated in <code>java.io</code>, consult
<a href="deprecatedio.html">Alternatives to Deprecated Classes and Methods in <code>java.io</code></a>.

<p>
Many programs that use the <code>DataInputStream</code>
<code>readLine</code> method can be converted to use the
<code>BufferedReader</code>'s <code>readLine</code> method instead.
Sometimes, this change is straightforward. A programmer can
simply modify the program
so that it creates and uses a <code>BufferedReader</code> instead of a
<code>DataInputStream</code>. Code like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
DataInputStream d = new DataInputStream(in);
</pre>
</blockquote>
changes to:
<blockquote>
<pre>
BufferedReader d = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
</pre>
</blockquote>

Let's look at an example from 
<a target="_top" href="..\..\networking\urls\readingurl.html">Reading Directly from a URL</a><a href="..\..\networking\urls\readingurl.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/networkingIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Custom Networking trail)"></a>.
That section features the <code>URLReader</code> program that
calls <code>DataInputStream</code> <code>readLine</code>.
Here's the program in its original 1.0 form with
the call to the deprecated API shown in bold:
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

class URLReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL yahoo = new URL("http://www.yahoo.com/");
        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(
                                 yahoo.openStream());

        String inputLine;

        while ((inputLine = <strong>in.readLine()</strong>) != null)
            System.out.println(inputLine);

        in.close();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
To change this program so that it no longer uses deprecated
API, we can modify the program to use a <code>BufferedReader</code>
instead of a <code>DataInputStream</code>. Here's the new 1.1
version of this program with the changes shown in bold:
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

class URLReader {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        URL yahoo = new URL("http://www.yahoo.com/");
	<strong>BufferedReader</strong> in = new <strong>BufferedReader(
                                new InputStreamReader(</strong>
                                yahoo.openStream())<strong>)</strong>;

        String inputLine;

        while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null)
            System.out.println(inputLine);

        in.close();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
We can make this simple change to <code>URLReader</code>
because <code>readLine</code> is the only <code>DataInputStream</code>
method used by this program.
<p>
However, <code>DataInputStream</code>
and <code>BufferedReader</code> are not source code compatible
(they do not support all of the same methods).
If your program uses other <code>DataInputStream</code> methods that
are not supported by <code>BufferedReader</code>, then your conversion
may not be this simple.

<p>
For instance, one example in this book, <code>DataIOTest</code> from
the
<a target="_top" href="..\..\essential\io\dataio.html">Using <code>DataInputStream</code> and <code>DataOutputStream</code></a><a href="..\..\essential\io\dataio.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a>, uses not only <code>readLine</code>, but also three of 
<code>DataInputStream</code>'s other <code>read<em>XXX</em></code> methods:
<code>readDouble</code>, <code>readInt</code>, and <code>readChar</code>.
Here's the 1.0 version of <code>DataIOTest</code> with these
method calls shown in bold:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.io.*;

class DataIOTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        // write the data out
        DataOutputStream out = new DataOutputStream(new
                                   FileOutputStream("invoice1.txt"));

        double[] prices = { 19.99, 9.99, 15.99, 3.99, 4.99 };
        int[] units = { 12, 8, 13, 29, 50 };
        String[] descs = { "Java T-shirt",
                           "Java Mug",
                           "Duke Juggling Dolls",
                           "Java Pin",
                           "Java Key Chain" };

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i ++) {
            out.writeDouble(prices[i]);
            out.writeChar('\t');
            out.writeInt(units[i]);
            out.writeChar('\t');
            out.writeChars(descs[i]);
            out.writeChar('\n');
        }
        out.close();

        // read it in again
        DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(new
                                 FileInputStream("invoice1.txt"));

        double price;
        int unit;
        String desc;
        double total = 0.0;

        try {
            while (true) {
                price = <strong>in.readDouble()</strong>;
                <strong>in.readChar()</strong>;       // throws out the tab
                unit = <strong>in.readInt()</strong>;
                <strong>in.readChar()</strong>;       // throws out the tab
                desc = <strong>in.readLine()</strong>;
                System.out.println("You've ordered " +
                                    unit + " units of " +
                                    desc + " at $" + price);
                total = total + unit * price;
            }
        } catch (EOFException e) {
        }
        System.out.println("For a TOTAL of: $" + total);
        in.close();
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
The solution of swapping a <code>BufferedReader</code> for the
<code>DataInputStream</code> won't work in this program because
<code>BufferedReader</code> does not
support <code>readDouble</code>, <code>readInt</code>, or <code>readChar</code>.
<p>
In this situation, you have three choices:
<ol>
<li> Change the algorithm so that the program doesn't need to read lines.
<li> Use an <code>ObjectInputStream</code> in place of the
     <code>DataInputStream</code>. (<code>ObjectInputStream</code> provides
     methods for reading all of Java's primitive data types and so
     supports <code>readDouble</code>, <code>readInt</code>, or <code>readChar</code>
     as well as <code>readLine</code>.)
<li> Call <code>DataInputStream</code>'s <code>readChar</code> method iteratively.
</ol>

The first option won't work for most programs.
Because <code>DataIOTest</code> is an example of how to use
<code>DataInputStream</code> it doesn't really make sense to
use an <code>ObjectInputStream</code> instead. So for this example,
option #2 won't work. But, this situation
is a bit unusual and it's likely that <code>ObjectInputStream</code>
will serve most programmers better (who wants to re-write
<code>readLine</code> all the time especially given that a newline
character is differs by platform?).
So, we'll show you two solutions for the <code>DataIOTest</code> example
one implementing option #2 and one implementing option #3.

<p>
Here's <code>DataIOTest</code>
modified to use an
<code>ObjectInputStream</code> instead of a
<code>DataInputStream</code>. Note that the
<code>DataOutputStream</code> had to
be changed to an <code>ObjectOutputStream</code>
so that the data written by
it could be read by the <code>ObjectInputStream</code>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.io.*;

class DataIOTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

        // write the data out
        <strong>ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new
                                   FileOutputStream("invoice1.txt"));</strong>

	// ...
	// <em>unchanged code removed for the sake of brevity</em>
	// ...

        // read it in again
        <strong>ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new
                                   FileInputStream("invoice1.txt"));</strong>
	// ...
	// <em>unchanged code removed for the sake of brevity</em>
	// ...

    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
And here's another version modified to use
<code>DataInputStream</code>'s <code>readChar</code> method iteratively
instead of <code>readLine</code>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.io.*;

class DataIOTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

	// ...
	// <em>unchanged code removed for the sake of brevity</em>
	// ...

        double price;
        int unit;
        <strong>StringBuffer desc;</strong>
        double total = 0.0;

        try {
            while (true) {
                price = in.readDouble();
                in.readChar();       // throws out the tab
                unit = in.readInt();
                in.readChar();       // throws out the tab
                <strong>char chr;
                desc = new StringBuffer(20);
                char lineSep = System.getProperty("line.separator").charAt(0);
                while ((chr = in.readChar()) != lineSep)
                    desc.append(chr);</strong>
                System.out.println("You've ordered " +
                                    unit + " units of " +
                                    desc + " at $" + price);
                total = total + unit * price;
            }
        } catch (EOFException e) {
        }
        System.out.println("For a TOTAL of: $" + total);
        in.close();
    }
}
