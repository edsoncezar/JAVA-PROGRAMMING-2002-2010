    What Is a Thread?
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

All programmers are familiar with writing sequential programs.
You've probably written a program that displays "Hello World!",
or sorts a list of names, or computes a list of prime numbers.
These are sequential programs: each has a beginning, an execution
sequence, and an end. At any given time during the runtime of the
program there is a single point of execution.
<p>
A thread is similar to the sequential programs described previously. A
single thread also has a beginning, a sequence, and an end and at any
given time during the runtime of the thread, there is a single point of
execution. However, a thread itself is not a program; it cannot run on
its own. Rather, it runs within a program. The following figure shows
this relationship.

<strong>Definition:</strong> A thread is a single sequential
flow of control within a program.
<hr>
<p>
There is nothing new in the concept of a single thread.
The real hoopla surrounding threads is not about a single
sequential thread. Rather, it's about the use of multiple threads
in a single program, running at the same time and performing
different tasks. This is illustrated by the following figure:

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/essential/12thread.gif" WIDTH="359" HEIGHT="121" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
<p>
The HotJava Web browser is an example of a multithreaded application.
Within the HotJava browser you can scroll a page while it's downloading
an applet or image, play animation and sound concurrently, print
a page in the background while you download a new page, or watch
three sorting algorithms race to the finish. You are used to life
operating in a concurrent fashion...so why not your browser?
<p>
Some texts use the name <em>lightweight process</em> instead
of thread. A thread is similar to a real process in that a thread
and a running program are both a single sequential flow of control.
However, a thread is considered lightweight because it runs within
the context of a full-blown program and takes advantage of the
resources allocated for that program and the program's environment.
<p>
As a sequential flow of control, a thread must carve out some of
its own resources within a running program. (It must have its
own execution stack and program counter for example.) The code
running within the thread works only within that context. Thus,
some other texts use <em>execution context</em> as a synonym for thread.
