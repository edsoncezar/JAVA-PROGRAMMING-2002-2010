<h2>
    Java's Catch or Specify Requirement
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

As stated previously, Java requires that a method either catch or
specify all checked exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of
the method. This requirement has several components
that need further description: "catch", "specify," "checked exceptions,"
and "exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of the method."

<h4>Catch</h4>
<blockquote>
A method can catch an exception by providing an exception handler for
that type of exception. The next page, <a href=dealing.html>Dealing with Exceptions</a>,
introduces an example program, talks about catching exceptions, and shows you how
to write an exception handler for the example program.
</blockquote>

<h4>Specify</h4>
<blockquote>
If a method chooses not to catch an exception, the method must
specify that it can throw that exception. Why did the Java designers make this requirement?
Because any exception that can be thrown by a method is really part of
the method's public programming interface: callers of a method must know
about the exceptions that a method can throw in order to intelligently
and consciously decide what to do about those exceptions. Thus, in the method
signature you specify the exceptions that the method can throw.
<p>
The next page, <a href=dealing.html>Dealing with Exceptions</a>,
talks about specifying exceptions that a method throws and shows you how to do it.
</blockquote>

<h4>Checked Exceptions</h4>
<blockquote>
Java has different types of exceptions, including I/O Exceptions, 
runtime exceptions, and exceptions of your own creation, to name a few.
Of interest to us in this discussion are runtime exceptions. Runtime
exceptions are those exceptions that occur within the Java runtime system.
This includes arithmetic exceptions (such as when dividing by zero), pointer
exceptions (such as trying to access an object through a null reference),
and indexing exceptions (such as attempting to access an array element
through an index that is too large or too small).
<p>
Runtime exceptions can occur anywhere in a program and in a typical
program can be very numerous. The cost of checking for runtime exceptions
often exceeds the benefit of catching or specifying them. Thus the compiler
does not require that you catch or specify runtime exceptions, although
you can. <em>Checked exceptions</em> are exceptions that are not runtime exceptions
and are checked by the compiler; the compiler checks that these
exceptions are caught or specified.
<p>
Some consider this a loophole in Java's exception handling mechanism,
and programmers are tempted to make all exceptions runtime exceptions.
In general, this is not recommended.
<a href=runtime.html>Runtime Exceptions--The Controversy</a> contains a thorough
discussion about when and how to use runtime exceptions.
</blockquote>

<h4>Exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of the method</h4>
<blockquote>
The statement "exceptions that can be thrown within the scope of the method"
may seem obvious at first: just look for the <code>throw</code> statement.
However, this statement includes more than just the exceptions that can be thrown
directly by the method: the key is in the phrase <em>within the scope of</em>.
This phrase includes any exception that can be thrown while the flow of control
remains within the method. This statement includes both
<ul>
<li>
Exceptions that are thrown directly by the method with Java's <code>throw</code>
statement.
<li>
Exceptions that are thrown indirectly by the method through calls to other
methods
</ul>
