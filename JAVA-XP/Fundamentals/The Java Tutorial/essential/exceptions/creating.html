<h2>
    Creating Your Own Exception Classes
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

When you design a package of Java classes that collaborate to
provide some useful function to your users, you work hard to
ensure that your classes interact well together and that their
interfaces are easy to understand and use. You should
spend just as much time thinking about and designing the exceptions
that your classes throw.
<p>
Suppose you are writing a linked list class that you're
planning to distribute as freeware.
Among other methods, your linked list class supports these methods:
<dl>
<dt>
<b><code>objectAt(int <em>n</em>)</code></b>
<dd>
Returns the object in the <code>n</code>th position in the list.
<dt>
<b><code>firstObject</code></b>
<dd>
Returns the first object in the list.
<dt>
<b><code>indexOf(Object <em>n</em>)</code></b>
<dd>
Searches the list for the specified <code>Object</code> and returns its
position in the list.
</dl>

<h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4>
<blockquote>
Because many programmers will be using your linked list class, you
can be assured that many will misuse or abuse your class and its methods.
Also, some legitimate calls to your linked list's methods may result
in an undefined result. Regardless, in the face of errors, you want your
linked list class to be as robust as possible,
to do something reasonable about errors, and to communicate errors back to
the calling program. However, you can't anticipate how each user of your
linked list class will want the object to behave under adversity.
So, often the best thing to do when an error occurs is to throw an exception.
<p>
Each of the methods supported by your linked list might throw an
exception under certain conditions, and each method might throw
a different type of exception than the others. For example,
<dl>
<dt>
<b><code>objectAt</code></b>
<dd>
Throws an exception if the integer passed into the method is less than
0 or larger than the number of objects currently in the list.
<dt>
<b><code>firstObject</code></b>
<dd>
Throws an exception if the list contains no objects.
<dt>
<b><code>indexOf</code></b>
<dd>
Throws an exception if the object passed into the method is
not in the list.
</dl>
But what type of exception should each method throw? Should it be
an exception provided with the Java development environment? Or should
you roll your own?
</blockquote>

<h4>Choosing the Exception Type to Throw</h4>
<blockquote>
When faced with choosing the type of exception to throw, you have two
choices:
<ol>
<li>
Use one written by someone else. The Java development
environment provides a lot of exception classes that you could use.
<li>
Write one of your own.
</ol>

You should go to the trouble of writing your own exception classes
if you answer "yes" to any of the following questions. Otherwise, you
can probably get away with using someone else's:
<ul>
<li>
Do you need an exception type that isn't represented by those in
the Java development environment?
<li>
Would it help your users if they could differentiate your exceptions
from those thrown by classes written by other vendors?
<li>
Does your code throw more than one related exception?
<li>
If you use someone else's exceptions, will your users have access to
those exceptions? A similar question is:  Should your package be
independent and self-contained?
</ul>
<p>
Your linked list class can throw multiple exceptions, and it would
be convenient to be able to catch all exceptions thrown by the linked
list with one exception handler. Also, if you plan to distribute your linked
list in a package, all related code should be packaged together.
Thus for the linked list, you should roll your own exception class
hierarchy.
<p>
The following diagram illustrates one possible exception class hierarchy
for your linked list:

<blockquote><IMG SRC="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/figures/essential/9linked.gif" WIDTH="397" HEIGHT="116" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></blockquote>
<code>LinkedListException</code> is the parent class of all the possible exceptions
that can be thrown by the linked list class. Users of your linked list
class can write a single exception handler to handle all linked list
exceptions with a <code>catch</code> statement like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
catch (LinkedListException) {
    . . . 
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
Or, users could write more specialized handlers for each subclass of
<code>LinkedListException</code>.
</blockquote>

<h4>Choosing a Superclass</h4>
<blockquote>
The diagram above does not indicate the superclass of the <code>LinkedListException</code>
class. As you know, Java exceptions must be <code>Throwable</code> objects (they must be
instances of <code>Throwable</code> or a subclass of <code>Throwable</code>). So, your temptation might
be to make <code>LinkedListException</code>a subclass of <code>Throwable</code>. However,
the <code>java.lang package</code> provides two <code>Throwable</code> subclasses that further divide
the type of problems that can occur within a Java program: <code>Error</code>s and
<code>Exception</code>s. Most of the applets and applications that you write will
throw objects that are <code>Exception</code>s. (<code>Error</code>s are reserved for serious hard
errors that occur deep in the system.)
<p>
Theoretically, any <code>Exception</code> subclass could be used as the parent
class of <code>LinkedListException</code>.   However, a quick perusal of those
classes show that they are either too specialized or completely unrelated
to <code>LinkedListException</code> to be appropriate.
Thus, the parent class of <code>LinkedListException</code> should be <code>Exception.</code>
<p>
Because runtime exceptions don't have to be specified in the <code>throws</code> clause
of a method, many packages developers ask: "Isn't
it just easier if I make all of my exception inherit from <code>RuntimeException</code>?"
The answer to this question is covered in detail
on <a href="runtime.html">Runtime Exceptions--The Controversy</a>.
The bottom line is that you shouldn't subclass <code>RuntimeException</code>
unless your class really is a runtime exception! For most of you, this
means "No, your exceptions shouldn't inherit from <code>RuntimeException</code>."
</blockquote>

<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>
<blockquote>
It's good practice to append the word "Exception" to the end of
all classes that inherit (directly or indirectly) from the
<code>Exception</code> class. Similarly, classes that inherit from the <code>Error</code>
class should end with the string "Error".
