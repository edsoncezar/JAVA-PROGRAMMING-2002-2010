<h2>
    JavaBeans Concepts
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>


<p>
The JavaBeans API makes it possible to write component
software in the Java programming language.
Components are self-contained, reusable software units that
can be visually composed into composite components, applets, applications,
and servlets using visual application builder tools.
JavaBean components are known as <i>Beans</i>.
<p>
Components expose their features
(for example, public methods and events) to
builder tools for visual manipulation.

A Bean's features are exposed because feature names adhere to specific
<i>design patterns</i>.
A "JavaBeans-enabled" builder tool can then examine
the Bean's patterns, discern its features, and expose
those features for visual manipulation.
A builder tool maintains Beans in a palette
or toolbox. You can select a 
Bean from the toolbox, drop it into a form,
modify it's appearance and behavior, define its
interaction with other Beans, and
compose it and other Beans into an applet,
application, or new Bean. All this can be done
without writing a line of code.

<p>
The following list briefly describes key Bean concepts,
and gives the chapter in the JavaBeans specification
where you can read a complete description.
<ul>
<li>Builder tools discover a Bean's features (that is, 
    its properties, methods, and events) by a
    process known as <em>introspection</em>.
    Beans support introspection in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>By adhering to specific rules,
          known as <em>design patterns</em>, when
          naming Bean features. The
          <a href="http://java.sun.com/beans/docs/javadoc/java.beans.Introspector.html">
          <code>java.beans.Introspector</code></a> class examines Beans for
          these design patterns to discover Bean features.
          The <code>Introspector</code> class relies on the 
          <em><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/guide/reflection/index.html">
          core reflection</a></em> API. The
          <a href="..\..\reflect\index.html">Reflection API</a> trail
          is an excellent place to learn about reflection.
      <li>By explicity providing property, method, and
          event information with a related <em>Bean
          Information</em> class. A Bean information
          class implements the <code>BeanInfo</code>
          interface. A <code>BeanInfo</code> class
          explicitly lists those Bean features that
          are to be exposed to application builder tools.
     </ul>
    Chapter 8 of the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/beans/spec.html">JavaBeans API
    Specification</a> discusses introspection, design patterns,
    and <code>BeanInfo</code> objects.
    <p>
<li><em>Properties</em> are a Bean's appearance and
    behavior characteristics that can be changed at design time.
    Builder tools introspect on a Bean to discover its
    properties, and expose those properties for manipulation.
    Chapter 7 of the JavaBeans API Specification
    discusses properties.
    <p>
<li>Beans expose properties so they can be <em>customized</em> 
    at design time.
    Customization is supported in two ways: By using property
    editors, or by using more sophisticated Bean customizers.
    Chapter 9 of the JavaBeans API
    Specification discusses Bean customization.
    <p>
<li>Beans use <em>events</em> to communicate with other Beans.
    A Bean that wants to receive events (a listener Bean) registers
    its interest with the Bean that fires the event (a source Bean).
    Builder tools can examine a Bean and determine which events that
    Bean can fire (send) and which it can handle (receive).
    Chapter 6 of the JavaBeans API
    Specification discusses events.
    <p>
<li><em>Persistence</em> enables Beans to 
    save and restore their state.
    Once you've changed a Beans properties, you can
    save the state of the Bean and restore that Bean
    at a later time, property changes intact.
    JavaBeans uses Java Object Serialization to support
    persistence.
    Chapter 5 of the JavaBeans API
    Specification discusses persistence.
    <p>
<li>A Bean's <em>methods</em> are no different than Java methods,
    and can be called from other Beans or a scripting environment.
    By default all public methods are exported.

</ul>

<p>
Although Beans are designed to be understood by builder tools,
all key APIs, including support for events, properties, and persistence,
have been designed to be easily read and understood by
human programmers as well.
