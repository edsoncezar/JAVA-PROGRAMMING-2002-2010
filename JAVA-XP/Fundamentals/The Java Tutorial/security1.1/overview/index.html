<blockquote>

<dl>

<dt><b><a name="Public Key">Public Key</a></b><p>

<dd>A number associated with a
particular entity (for example, an individual or an organization).
A public key is intended to be known to everyone
who needs to have trusted interactions with that entity.<p>

<dt><b><a name="Private Key">Private Key</a></b><p>

<dd>A number that is supposed to be known only to a particular 
entity. That is, private keys are always meant to be kept secret.
A private key is always associated with a single public key.<p>

<dt><b><a name="Digital Signature">Digital Signature</a></b><p>

<dd>A string of bits that is computed from some data (the data
being "signed") and the private key of an entity.  

The signature can be used to verify that the data came from the entity. 

<p>Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature has many
useful characteristics:<p>

<ul>

<li>Its authenticity can be verified, via a computation that
uses the public key corresponding to the private key used to
generate the signature.<p>

<li>It cannot be forged, assuming the private key is kept secret.<p>

<li>It is a function of the data signed and thus can't be 
claimed to be the signature for other data as well.<p>

<li>The signed data cannot be changed; if it is, the signature
will no longer verify as being authentic.<p>

</ul>

<dt><b>Cryptography Algorithm</b><p>

<dd>An algorithm used to help ensure one or
more of the following:<p>

<ol>

<li>the confidentiality of data <p>

<li>authentication of the data sender <p>

<li>integrity of the data sent<p>

<li>nonrepudiation; a sender cannot deny having sent a particular message<p>

</ul>

<p>A <a href = "#Digital Signature">digital signature</a> algorithm provides some of these characteristics. Also see 
<a href = "#Message Digest">message digest</a> algorithms. Digital signature and message digest algorithms are available in JDK 1.1.

<p>A separate release (Java Cryptography Extensions) will provide APIs and 
algorithms related to <a href = "#Encryption"><i>encryption</i></a> and 
<a href = "#Decryption"><i>decryption</i></a>.<p>

<dt><b><a name="Encryption">Encryption</a></b><p>

<dd>The process of taking data (called <i>cleartext</i>)
and a short string (a <i>key</i>) and producing <i>ciphertext</i>, 
which is data meaningless to a third-party who does not know the key.<p>

<dt><b><a name="Decryption">Decryption</a></b><p>

<dd>The inverse of 
<a href = "#Encryption">encryption</a>; the process of taking ciphertext 
and a short key string, and producing cleartext. <p>


<dt><b><a name="Certificate">Certificate</a></b><p>

<dd>A digitally signed statement from
one entity, saying that the public key of some
other entity has some particular value.
If you trust the entity that signed a certificate, you trust that the 
association in the certificate between the specified public key and another 
particular entity is authentic.<p>

<dt><b><a name="Message Digest">Message Digest Algorithm (or One-Way Hash Function)</a></b><p>

<dd>A function that
takes arbitrary-sized input data (referred to as a <i>message</i>)
and generates a fixed-size
output, called a <I>digest</I> (or hash). A digest 
has the following properties:<p>

<UL>
<LI>It should be computationally infeasible to find another input
string that will generate the same digest.<p>
<LI>The digest does not reveal anything about the input that was
used to generate it.
</UL>

<p>Message digest algorithms are used to produce unique and 
reliable identifiers
of data. The digests are sometimes called the "digital fingerprints"
of data.

<P>Some digital signature algorithms use
message digest algorithms for parts of their computations.

<p>Some digital signature systems compute the digest of a message
and digitally sign the digest rather than signing the message itself.
This can save a lot of time, since digitally signing a long message
can be time-consuming.

<p>

<dt><b><a name="Engine">Engine Class</a></b><p>

<dd>The term <i>engine class</i> is used in the Java Security API to refer to
a class that provides the functionality of
a type of cryptography algorithm. 
The Security API defines a Java class for each engine class. For example,
there is a <a href = "#MessageDigest">MessageDigest</a> class, 
a <a href = "#Signature">Signature</a> class, and a 
<a href = "#KPG">KeyPairGenerator</a> 
class. Users of the API request and utilize instances of these engine classes
to carry out corresponding operations.  A Signature
instance is used to sign and verify digital signatures, 
a MessageDigest instance is used to calculate the message digest of 
specified data, and a KeyPairGenerator is used to generate pairs of 
public and private keys suitable for a specified algorithm.

<p>
An engine class provides the interface to the functionality of
a specific type of algorithm, while its actual implementations 
(from one or more
<a href = "#Provider">providers</a>) are those for specific algorithms.
The Signature engine
class, for example, provides access to the functionality of a
digital signature algorithm. The actual implementation supplied
in a Signature subclass could be that for any kind of signature
algorithm, such as SHA-1 with DSA, SHA-1 with RSA, or MD5 with RSA. <p>


<dt><b><a name="Provider">Provider</a></b><p>

<dd><P>
Implementations for various algorithms in Java Security are provided by 
<i>Cryptography Package Providers</i>. Providers 
are essentially packages that implement one or more 
<a href = "#Engine">engine classes</a> for specific algorithms. For example, the Java Development
Kit's default provider, named "SUN", supplies implementations
of the DSA signature algorithm and of the MD5 and SHA-1 message digest
algorithms. Other providers may define their own implementations of
these algorithms or of other algorithms,
such as one of the RSA-based signature algorithms or the 
MD2 message digest algorithm.

<H1><a name="SecurityAPI">What Does the Java Security API Provide?</a></H1>

<blockquote>


<p>The Java Security API is a new Java core API, built around the
<code>java.security</code> package (and its subpackages).

<p>The first release of the Java Security API, available in JDK 1.1, contains
APIs for:

<dl>

<dt><b>Digital Signatures</b> 

<dd><a href = "#Digital Signature">Digital signature</a> algorithms, 
such as DSA (Digital Signature
Algorithm). The functionality
includes generating public/private key pairs as well as signing and
verifying arbitrary digital data.

<p><dt><b>Message Digests</b>

<dd>Cryptographically secure <a href = "#Message Digest">message digests</a>,
such as MD5 and
SHA-1. These algorithms, also called one-way hash algorithms, are
useful for producing "digital fingerprints" of data, which are
frequently used in digital signatures and other applications that need
unique and unforgeable identifiers for digital data.

<p><dt><b>Key Management</b>

<dd>A set of abstractions for managing principals (entities such as
individual users or groups), their keys, and their certificates. It
allows applications to design their own key management systems, and to
interoperate with other systems at a high level. Note that support for
specific certificate formats is not available but
will be part of a future JDK release.

</dl>

<p>The cryptography framework in the Java Security API is designed so
that a new algorithm can be added later on without much difficulty and
can be utilized in the same fashion as existing algorithms.  For
example, although DSA is the only built-in digital signature algorithm
in this release, the framework can easily accommodate another
algorithm such as RSA. Vendors can develop their own algorithms
and integrate their resulting <a href = "#Provider">provider</a>)
packages into the Java Security API so that clients
can utilize them.


</blockquote>


<H1><a name="JCE">What about Encryption and Decryption?</a></H1>

<blockquote>

<p>APIs for data <a href = "#Encryption"><i>encryption</i></a>
and <a href = "#Decryption"><i>decryption</i></a>, together with
some default algorithm implementations, will be released 
separately in a "Java
Cryptography Extension" (JCE) as an add-on package to JDK, in
accordance with U.S. export control regulations.


</blockquote>



<H1><a name="Core Classes">Core Classes</a></H1>

<blockquote>

<H2><a name="Signature">The Signature Class</a></H2>

<blockquote>

The Signature class is an <a href = "#Engine">engine class</a> 
designed to provide the
functionality of a <a href = "#Digital Signature">digital signature</a>
algorithm such as DSA or
RSA with MD5. A signature algorithm takes
arbitrary-sized input and a private key and generates a relatively
short (often fixed-size) string of bytes, called the <i>signature</i>, 
with the following properties:

<UL>
<LI>Given the public key corresponding to the private key used
to generate the signature, it should be possible to verify the
authenticity and integrity of the input.<p>
<LI>The signature and the public key do not reveal anything about
the private key.
</UL>

<P>
A Signature object can be used to generate a digital signature for
data. It can also be used to 
verify whether or not an alleged signature is in fact the authentic 
signature of the data associated with it. 

</blockquote>


<H2><a name="MessageDigest">The MessageDigest Class</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<P>
The MessageDigest class is an <a href = "#Engine">engine class</a> 
designed to provide
the functionality of cryptographically secure 
<a href = "#Digital Signature">Message Digest</a>message digests
such as SHA-1 or MD5. A cryptographically secure message digest
takes arbitrary-sized input (a byte array), and generates a fixed-size
output, called a <I>digest</I>. A digest has the following properties:
<UL>
<LI>It should be computationally infeasible to find another input
string that will generate the same digest.<p>
<LI>The digest does not reveal anything about the input that was
used to generate it.
</UL>

<P>
Message digests are used to produce unique and reliable identifiers
of data. They are sometimes called the "digital fingerprints"
of data.

</blockquote>


<H2><a name="Key">Key Interfaces</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<P>
The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys
have three characteristics:

<UL>

<LI>An Algorithm

<P>

<LI>An Encoded Form

<P>
This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
is encoded according to a standard format (such as X.509
or PKCS#8).<p>

<LI>A Format

<P>
This is the name of the format of the encoded key.<P>

</UL>

Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
or various Identity classes used to manage keys.

<H3>The PublicKey and PrivateKey Interfaces</H3>

<blockquote>

<P>
The PublicKey and PrivateKey interfaces are method-less interfaces,
used for type-safety and type-identification for 
<a href = "#Public Key">public keys</a> and
<a href = "#Private Key">private keys</a>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<H2><a name="KeyPair">The KeyPair Class</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<P>
The KeyPair class is a simple holder for a key pair (a public key and a
private key). It has two public methods, one for returning the private
key, and the other for returning the public key.<p>

</blockquote>




<H2><a name="KPG">The KeyPairGenerator Class</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<P>
The KeyPairGenerator class is an <a href = "#Engine">engine class</a> 
used to generate pairs of
public and private keys.<p>
