    Threads in Applets: Examples
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

This page discusses two examples of using threads in applets.
The first applet, AnimatorApplet,
shows how to use a thread to perform repeated tasks.
AnimatorApplet is from the page
<a target="_top" href="..\..\ui\drawing\animloop.html">Creating the Animation Loop</a><a target="_top" href="..\..\ui\drawing\animloop.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/uiIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Creating a User Interface trail)"></a>.
The second applet this page discusses, SoundExample,
shows how to use threads for one-time initialization tasks.
SoundExample is featured in
<a target="_top" href="..\appletsonly\sound.html">Playing Sounds</a><a target="_top" href="..\appletsonly\sound.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/appletIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Writing Applets trail)"></a>.

<p>

This page does not explain basic thread code.
To learn about the Java implementation of threads,
refer to 
<a target="_top" href="..\..\essential\threads\index.html">Threads of Control</a><a href="..\..\essential\threads\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a>.


<h4>
Using a Thread to Perform Repeated Tasks
</h4>
<blockquote>
An applet that performs the same task over and over again
typically should have a thread 
with a <code>while</code> (or <code>do...while</code>) loop
that performs the task.
A typical example is an applet that performs timed animation,
such as a movie player or a game.
Animation applets need a thread
that requests repaints at regular intervals.
Another example is an applet
that reads data supplied by a server-side application.
(See
<a href="workaround.html">Using a Server to Work Around Security Restrictions</a>
for such an example.)

<p>

Applets typically create threads for repetitive tasks
in the applet <code>start</code> method.
Creating the thread there
makes it easy for the applet to stop the thread
when the user leaves the page.
All you need to do is implement the <code>stop</code> method 
so that it stops the applet's thread.
When the user returns to the applet's page,
the <code>start</code> method is called again,
and the applet can again create a thread
to perform the repetitive task.

<p>

Below is <code>AnimatorApplet</code>'s implementation of the
<code>start</code> and
<code>stop</code> methods.
(Here is all of the applet's
<a href=http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/ui/drawing/example-1dot1/AnimatorApplet.java>source code</a>.)

<blockquote>
<pre>
public void start() {
    if (frozen) {
        //Do nothing.  The user has requested that we
        //stop changing the image.
    } else {
        //Start animating!
        if (animatorThread == null) {
            animatorThread = new Thread(this);
        }
        animatorThread.start();
    }
}

public void stop() {
    animatorThread = null;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

The <code>this</code> in <code>new Thread(this)</code>
indicates that the applet provides the body of the thread.
It does so by implementing the <code>java.lang</code> <code>Runnable</code> interface,
which requires the applet to provide a <code>run</code> method
that forms the body of the thread.
We'll discuss <code>AnimatorApplet</code>'s <code>run</code> method more a little later.

<p>

Notice that nowhere
in the <code>AnimatorApplet</code> class is
the <code>Thread stop</code> method called.
This is because calling the <code>Thread stop</code> method 
is like clubbing the thread over the head.
It's a drastic way to get the thread to stop what it's doing.
Instead, you can write the thread's <code>run</code> method 
in such a way that the thread will gracefully exit
when you tap it on the shoulder.
This shoulder tap comes in the form of
setting to null an instance variable of type <code>Thread</code>.

<p>

In <code>AnimatorApplet</code>,
this instance variable is called <code>animatorThread</code>.
The <code>start</code> method sets it
to refer to the newly created <code>Thread</code> object.
When the applet needs to kill the thread,
it sets <code>animatorThread</code> to null.
This kills the thread <em>not</em> by making it be garbage collected --
it can't be garbage collected while it's runnable --
but because at the top of its loop, 
the thread checks <code>animatorThread</code>,
continuing or exiting depending on the value of <code>animatorThread</code>.
Here's the relevant code:

<blockquote>
<pre>
public void run() {
    . . .
    while (Thread.currentThread() == animatorThread) {
        ...<em>//Display a frame of animation and then sleep.</em>
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

If <code>animatorThread</code> refers to the same thread
as the currently executing thread,
the thread continues executing.
If, on the other hand, <code>animatorThread</code> is null,
the thread exits.
If <code>animatorThread</code> refers to <em>another</em> thread,
then a race condition has occurred:
<code>start</code> has been called so soon after <code>stop</code>
(or this thread has taken such a long time in its loop)
that <code>start</code> has created another thread
before this thread reached the top of its <code>while</code> loop.
Whatever the cause of the race condition, this thread should exit.

<h4>
Using a Thread to Perform One-Time Initialization
</h4>
<blockquote>

If your applet needs to perform some initialization task 
that can take a while,
you should consider ways of performing the initialization
in a thread.
For example, anything that requires making a network connection
should generally be done in a background thread.
Fortunately, GIF and JPEG image loading
is automatically done in the background
using threads that you don't need to worry about.

<p>

Sound loading, unfortunately, 
is not guaranteed to be done in the background.
In current implementations,
the <code>Applet getAudioClip</code> methods 
don't return until they've loaded all the audio data. 
As a result, if you want to preload sounds,
you might want to create one or more threads to do so.

<p>

Using a thread to perform a one-time initialization task for an applet
is a variation of the classic producer/consumer scenario.
The thread that performs the task is the producer,
and the applet is the consumer.
<a target="_top" href="..\..\essential\threads\synchronization.html">Synchronizing Threads</a><a href="..\..\essential\threads\synchronization.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a> discusses how to use Java threads in a producer/consumer scenario.

<p>

SoundExample adheres closely to the model presented in Synchronizing Threads.
Like the Synchronizing Threads example,
SoundExample features three classes:

<ul>
<li> The producer:
     <a href=http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/applet/appletsonly/example-1dot1/SoundLoader.java><code>SoundLoader</code></a>,
     a <code>Thread</code> subclass.
<li> The consumer:
     <a href=http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/applet/appletsonly/example-1dot1/SoundExample.java><code>SoundExample</code></a>,
     an <code>Applet</code> subclass.
     Unlike the Synchronizing Threads consumer example,
     <code>SoundExample</code> is not a <code>Thread</code>;
     it doesn't even implement the <code>Runnable</code> interface.
     However, the <code>SoundExample</code> instance methods are executed
     by at least two threads, depending on the application 
     that executes the <code>SoundExample</code> applet.
<li> The storage object:
     <a href=http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/applet/appletsonly/example-1dot1/SoundList.java><code>SoundList</code></a>,
     a <code>Hashtable</code> subclass.
     Unlike <code>CubbyHole</code> in the Synchronizing Threads example,
     <code>SoundList</code> can return null values 
     if the sound data hasn't been stored yet.
     This makes sense for this applet
     because it needs to be able to react immediately
     to a user request to play the sound,
     even if the sound hasn't been loaded yet.
</ul>
