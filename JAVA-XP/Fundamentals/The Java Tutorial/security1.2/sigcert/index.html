<h1>
     API and Tools Use for Secure Code and File Exchanges
</h1>

<blockquote>

This lesson contains overview information to 
help you understand why digital signatures, certificates, and
keystores are needed. The lesson also compares use of the tools 
versus the JDK Security API with respect to generating signatures.
Such tool usage is demonstrated in the next two lessons,

<H2><a name="Intro">Code and Document Security</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>If you electronically send someone an important document (or documents),
or an applet or application to run, the recipient needs
a way of verifying that the document or code came from you and was
not modified in transit (for example, by a malicious user intercepting it).
Digital signatures, certificates, and keystores all help ensure the
security of the files you send.


<H3><a name="Sigs ">Digital Signatures </a></H3>

<blockquote>

The basic idea in the use of digital signatures is as follows.

<ol>
<li>You "sign" the document or code using one of your <b>private keys</b>, which 
you can generate by using <code>keytool</code> or security API methods.
That is, you generate a digital signature for the document or code, using
the <code>jarsigner</code> tool or API methods.<p>

<li>You send to the other person, the "receiver," the document or code 
and the signature.<p>

<li>You also supply the receiver with the <b>public key</b> corresponding to the
private key used to generate the signature, if the receiver doesn't already have it.<p>

<li>The receiver uses the public key to verify the authenticity of the
signature and the integrity of the document/code.

</ol>

<p>A receiver needs to ensure that the public key <i>itself</i> is
authentic before reliably using it to check the signature's authenticity.
Therefore it is more typical to supply a <b>certificate</b> containing
the public key rather than just the public key itself, as discussed in the next
section.

<p>For more information about the terminology and concepts of signing and 
verification, and further explanation of the benefits, see the

<a target="_top" href="..\..\jar\sign\intro.html">Understanding Signing and Verification</a><a href="..\..\jar\sign\intro.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/javaIcon.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Learning the Java Language trail)"></a>
section of the "The Java Archive (JAR) File Format" trail.

</blockquote>


<H3>Certificates</H3>

<blockquote>

A certificate contains 

<ul>

<li>A public key. <p>

<li>The "distinguished-name"
information of the entity (person, company, or so on)
whose certificate it is. This entity is referred to as the
certificate <i>subject</i>, or <i>owner</i>.
The  distinguished-name
information includes the following attributes (or a subset):
the entity's name, organizational unit, organization,
city or locality, state or province, and country code.<p>

<li>A digital signature. A certificate is signed by one entity, the
<i>issuer</i>, to vouch for the fact that the enclosed public key is the actual 
public key of another entity, the <i>owner</i>. <p>

<li>The distinguished-name information for the signer (issuer). 

</ul>

One way for a recipient to check whether a certificate is valid is by
verifying its digital signature, using its issuer's (signer's) public key.
That key may itself be stored in another certificate whose signature can be verified
by using the public key of that other certificate's issuer, 
and that key may <i>also</i> be stored in yet <i>another</i> certificate, and so on.
You can stop checking when you reach a public key that you already trust
and use it to verify the signature on the corresponding certificate.

<p>If the recipient cannot establish such a trust chain (for example, 
because the required issuer certificates are not available), 
the certificate <b>fingerprint(s)</b> can be calculated,
as may be done by the <code>keytool</code> 
<code>-import</code> or <code>-printcert</code> command.
Each fingerprint is a relatively short number that uniquely and 
reliably identifies the certificate. (Technically, the fingerprint is a hash
value of the certificate information, using a
<a href = "..\summary\glossary.html#MessageDigest">message digest</a>
function.)
The recipient can call up the
certificate owner and compare the fingerprints of the 
received certificate with those of the certificate that was sent. 
If the fingerprints are the same, the certificates are the 
same.

<p>Thus you can ensure that a certificate was not modified
in transit. One other potential uncertainty when working with
certificates is the identity of the sender. 
Sometimes a certificate is <b>self-signed</b>, that is, signed
using the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate;
the issuer is the same as the subject.
This is okay if the receiver already knows and trusts the sender.

<p>Otherwise the sender needs to obtain a certificate from a trusted
third party, referred to as a certification authority (CA). To do so,
you send a self-signed certificate signing request (CSR) to the
CA. The CA verifies the signature on the CSR and your identity, 
perhaps by checking your driver's license or other 
information. The CA then vouches for your being the owner of the public
key by issuing a certificate and signing it with its own (the CA's) private
key. Anybody who trusts the issuing CA's public key can now verify the
signature on the certificate. In many cases the issuing CA itself may
have a certificate from a CA higher up in the CA hierarchy, leading to
<b>certificate chains</b>.

<p>Certificates of entities you trust are
typically imported into your <a href = "#Keystores">keystore</a> as 
"<b>trusted certificates</b>."
The public key in each such certificate may then be used to verify
signatures generated using the corresponding private key.

Such verifications can be done by

<ul>
<li>the <code>jarsigner</code> tool (if the document/code and signature
appear in a JAR file),<p>
<li>API methods, or<p>
<li>the runtime system, when a resource access is attempted and a
policy file specifies that the resource access is allowed for the code
attempting the access if its signature is authentic. The code's class file(s) and signature
must be in a JAR file.
</ul>

<p>If you are sending signed code or documents to others, you need to
supply them with the certificate containing the public key corresponding
to the private key used to sign the code/document. 
The <code>keytool</code> <code>-export</code> command or API methods
can export your certificate from your keystore to a file, which can then be 
sent to anyone needing it. A person who receives the certificate can import
it into the keystore as a trusted certificate, using,
for example, API methods or the 
<code>keytool</code> <code>-import</code> command. 

<p>If you use the <code>jarsigner</code> tool to generate a signature for a JAR file,
the tool retrieves your certificate and its supporting certificate chain from
your keystore. The tool then stores them, along with the signature, in the JAR
file.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="Keystores">Keystores</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Private keys and their associated public key certificates are stored 
in password-protected databases called <b>keystores</b>. A keystore
can contain two types of entries: the trusted certificate entries discussed above,
and key/certificate entries, each containing a private key and the
corresponding public key certificate.
Each entry in a keystore is identified by an <em>alias</em>.

<p>A keystore owner can have multiple keys in the keystore, 
accessed via different aliases. 
An alias is typically named after a particular role in which the
keystore owner uses the associated key. An alias may
also identify the purpose of the key. For example, the alias
<code>signPersonalEmail</code> might be used to identify a keystore entry whose
private key is used for signing
personal e-mail, and the alias <code>signJarFiles</code> might be used to identify an
entry whose private key is used for
signing JAR files.

<p>The <code>keytool</code> tool can be used 
to 

<ul>
<li>Create private keys and their associated public key certificates
<li>Issue certificate
requests, which you send to the appropriate certification authority
<li>Import certificate replies, obtained from the certification authority
you contacted
<li>Import public key certificates belonging to other parties as
trusted certificates 
<li>Manage your keystore
</ul>

<p>API methods can also be used to access and to modify a keystore.

</blockquote>

</blockquote>



<H2><a name="Notes">Tool and API Notes</a></H2>

<blockquote>

Note the following regarding use of the tools and the API
related to digital signatures.

<ul>

<li>You can use the JDK Security API, tools, or a combination
to generate keys and signatures and to import certificates.
You can use these API or tool features to securely exchange
documents with others.<p>

<li>To use the <i>tools</i> for document exchange, the document(s)
must be placed in a JAR (Java ARchive) file, which 
may be created by the <code>jar</code> tool.
A JAR file is a good way of encapsulating multiple files in one spot.
When a file is "signed", the resulting digital signature bytes need to be stored
somewhere. When a JAR file is signed, the signature can go in the JAR file
itself. This is what happens when you use the <code>jarsigner</code>
tool to sign a JAR file.<p>

<li>If you are creating applet code 
that you will sign, it needs to be placed in a JAR file.
The same is true if you are creating application code that may be
similarly restricted by running it with a security manager.
The reason you need the JAR file is that when a policy file 
specifies that code signed by a particular entity
is permitted one or more operations, such as specific file reads or writes,
the code is expected to come from a signed JAR file. (The term "signed code"
is an abbreviated way of saying "code in a class file that appears in
a JAR file that was signed.")<p>

<li>In order for the runtime system to check a code signature,
the person/organization that will run the code first needs to 
import into their keystore a certificate authenticating the
public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the code.<p>

<li>In order for the <code>jarsigner</code> tool to verify the authenticity of
a JAR file signature, 
the person/organization that received the JAR file first needs to 
import into their keystore a certificate authenticating the
public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the code.<p>

<li>At this time there are no APIs for certificate creation.

</ul>

</blockquote>


<H2><a name="API">Use of the JDK Security API to Sign Documents</a></H2>

<blockquote>

The

<a target="_top" href="..\apisign\index.html">Generating and Verifying Signatures</a><a href="..\apisign\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1-2.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Java Security 1.2 trail)"></a>
lesson demonstrates the use of the JDK Security API with respect
to signing documents. The lesson shows what one program, executed by the
person who has the original document, would do to

<ul>
<li>generate keys,<p>
<li>generate a digital signature for the data using the private key, and<p> 
<li>export the public key and the signature to files.
</ul>

Then it shows an example of another program, executed by
the receiver of the data, signature, and public key. It shows how the
program could

<ul>
<li>import the public key and <p>
<li>verify the authenticity of the signature.
</ul>

The lesson also discusses and demonstrates possible alternative
approaches and methods of supplying and importing keys, including
in certificates.

<H2><a name="Tools">Use of the Tools to Sign Code or Documents</a></H2>

<blockquote>

The 

<a target="_top" href="..\toolsign\index.html">Signing Code and Granting It Permissions</a><a href="..\toolsign\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1-2.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Java Security 1.2 trail)"></a>
lesson shows use of the tools by a code developer to
put the code into a JAR file, sign it, and export the public key. Then it shows
use of the tools by 
someone who will run the code or by a system administrator to import the
signer's public key certificate and 
add an entry into a policy file
granting the code permission for the resource accesses it needs.

<p>The 

<a target="_top" href="..\toolfilex\index.html">Exchanging Files</a><a href="..\toolfilex\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1-2.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Java Security 1.2 trail)"></a>
lesson shows use of the tools by one person to sign an important document, 
such as a contract, and export the public key certificate for the public key
corresponding to the private key used to sign the contract.
Then it shows how another person receiving the contract, the signature, and
the public key certificate would use <code>keytool</code> to import the
certificate and the <code>jarsigner</code> tool to verify the
signature.

<p>These two lessons have much in common.
In both cases, the first two steps for the code or
document sender are to

<ul>

<li>
Create a JAR file containing the document
or class file</a>,
using the <code>jar</code> tool.<p>

<li>
Generate keys (if they don't already exist)</a>, 
using the <code>keytool</code> <code>-genkey</code> command.

</ul>

The next two steps are optional:

<ul>

<li>
Use the <code>keytool</code> <code>-certreq</code> command;
then send the resulting certificate signing request
to a certification authority (CA) such as VeriSign.<p>

<li>
Use the <code>keytool</code> <code>-import</code> command
to import the CA's response.

</ul>

The next two steps are required:

<ul>

<li>
Sign the JAR file</a>, 
using the <code>jarsigner</code> tool and the private key generated in Step 2.<p>

<li>
Export the public key certificate</a>,
using the <code>keytool</code> <code>-export</code> command. 
Then supply the signed JAR file and the 
certificate to the receiver.

</ul>

In both cases, the receiver of the signed JAR file and the 
certificate should
import the certificate as a trusted certificate</a>,
using the <code>keytool</code> <code>-import</code> command.
The <code>keytool</code> will attempt to construct a trust chain from the
certificate to be imported to an already trusted certificate in the
keystore. If that fails, the <code>keytool</code> will display the certificate fingerprint
and prompt you to verify it.

<p>If what was sent was code, the receiver also needs to
modify a policy file to permit the required resource accesses
to code signed by the 
private key corresponding to the public key in the imported
certificate.
The <b>Policy Tool</b> can be used to do this.

<p>If what was sent was one or more documents, the receiver needs to
verify the authenticity of the JAR file signature</a>, 
using the <code>jarsigner</code> tool.

<p>For further information regarding the tools, see 
<a href = "..\summary\tools.html">Tools Summary</a>.

<p>This lesson discusses the two optional steps. The other steps are
covered in the next two lessons,

. 


<H3><a name="GenCSR">Generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) 
for a Public Key Certificate</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>When <code>keytool</code> is used to generate public/private key pairs,
it creates a keystore entry containing a private key and a self-signed
certificate for the public key.
(That is, the certificate is signed using the corresponding private key.)
This may be adequate if the people receiving your
signed files already know and trust your identity.

<p>However, a certificate is more likely to be trusted by others if
it is signed by a certification authority (CA). 
To get a certificate signed by a CA, you first generate a certificate
signing request (CSR), via a command such as the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
keytool -certreq -alias <i>alias</i> -file <i>csrFile</i> 
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here <i>alias</i> is used to access the keystore entry
containing the private key and the public key certificate, and
<i>csrFile</i> specifies the name to be used for the CSR created by
this command.

<p>You then submit this file to a CA, such as VeriSign, Inc. 
The CA will authenticate you, the requestor ("subject"), usually off line,
and then will sign and return a certificate authenticating
your public key. That is, the CA vouches that you are the owner of
the public key by signing the certificate.
(In some cases, the CA will return a
chain of certificates, each one authenticating the public key of
the signer of the previous certificate in the chain.)

</blockquote>


<H3>Importing the Response from the CA</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>If you submitted a certificate signing request (CSR) to a
certification authority (CA), you need to replace the original self-signed 
certificate in your keystore with a certificate chain by importing
the certificate (or chain of certificates) returned to you by the CA.

<p>But first you need a "trusted certificate" entry in your keystore 
(or in the <code>cacerts</code> keystore file, described below)
that authenticates the <i>CA</i>'s public key. With such an entry the CA's
signature can be verified. That is, the CA's signature
on the certificate, or on the final certificate in the
chain the CA sends to you in response to your
CSR, can be verified. 


<H3><a name="ImportCA">Importing a Certificate from 
a CA as a "Trusted Certificate"</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Before you import the certificate reply from a CA, you need 
one or more  "trusted certificates" in your keystore or in the
<code>cacerts</code> file.

<ul>

<li>If the certificate reply is a certificate chain,
you just need the top certificate of the chain -- the "root" CA
certificate authenticating that CA's public key.<p>

<li>If the certificate reply is a single certificate, you need a 
certificate for the issuing CA (the one that signed it). If that certificate is not
self-signed, you need a certificate for its signer, and so on,
up to a self-signed "root" CA certificate.

</ul>

<p>The <code>cacerts</code> file represents a system-wide keystore with CA certificates.
This file resides in the JDK security properties directory,
<code><i>java.home</i>/lib/security</code>, where <i>java.home</i> is
the JDK installation directory. 

<p>The <code>cacerts</code> file currently ships with five VeriSign root CA
certificates. If you sent your CSR to VeriSign,
you won't need to import a VeriSign 
certificate as a trusted certificate in your keystore; you can
go on to the <a href = "#ImportReply">next</a> section to 
see how to import the 
certificate reply from the CA.

<p>A certificate from a CA is usually either 
self-signed or signed by another CA, in which case you also need a
certificate authenticating that CA's public key. Suppose that company
ABC, Inc., is a CA and that you obtain a
file named <code>ABCCA.cer</code>, purportedly a 
self-signed certificate from
ABC, authenticating that CA's public key. 

<p>Be very careful to ensure that the certificate is
valid prior to importing it as a "trusted" certificate!
View it first (using the <code>keytool</code> <code>-printcert</code> command or the
<code>keytool</code> <code>-import</code> command 
without the <code>-noprompt</code> option),
and make sure that the displayed certificate fingerprint(s) match the 
expected ones. You can call the person who sent the certificate
and compare the fingerprint(s) that you see with the ones that they show
or that a secure public key repository shows.
Only if the fingerprints are equal is it guaranteed that the certificate has not been 
replaced in transit with somebody else's (for example, an attacker's) certificate.
If such an attack took place and you did not check the certificate
before you imported it, you would end up trusting anything the
attacker has signed.

<p>If you trust that
the certificate is valid, you can add it
to your keystore via a command such as the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
keytool -import -alias <i>alias</i> -file ABCCA.cer -keystore <i>storefile</i> 
</pre>
</blockquote>

This command creates a "trusted certificate" entry in the keystore whose name is that
specified in <i>storefile</i>.
The entry contains
the data from the file <code>ABCCA.cer</code>, 
and it is assigned the specified alias.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="ImportReply">Importing the Certificate Reply from the CA</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Once you've imported the required trusted certificate(s), as described
in the previous section, or they are
already in your keystore or in the <code>cacerts</code> file,
you can import the certificate reply and thereby
replace your self-signed certificate with a certificate
chain. This chain will be either the one returned by the CA in response to
your request (if the CA reply is a chain) or one constructed (if the 
CA reply is a single certificate) by using 
the certificate reply and trusted certificates that are already available 
in the keystore or in the 
<code>cacerts</code> keystore file.

<p>As an example, suppose that you sent your certificate signing request to
VeriSign. You can then import the reply via
the following, which assumes that the returned certificate is in the
file specified by <i>certReplyFile</i>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore <i>storefile</i> -alias <i>alias </i> 
   -file <i>certReplyFile</i> 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Type this command on one line.

<p>The certificate reply is validated by
using trusted certificates from the keystore and optionally by using the
certificates configured in the <code>cacerts</code> keystore file (if the
<code>-trustcacerts</code> option is specified).
Each certificate in the chain is verified, using the
certificate at the next level higher in the chain. You need to
trust only the top-level "root" CA certificate in the chain. If you do not
already trust the top-level certificate, <code>keytool</code> will display the fingerprint
of that certificate and ask you whether you want to trust it.

<p>The new certificate chain of the specified (by <i>alias</i>) entry replaces 
the old certificate (or chain)
associated with this entry. The old chain can be replaced only if a
valid <i>keypass</i>, the password used to protect the private key of the
entry, is supplied. If no password is provided and if the private key
password is different from the keystore password, the user is prompted
for it. 

<p>For more detailed information about generating CSRs and
importing certificate replies, see the <code>keytool</code>
documentation on the public <code>java.sun.com</code> web site:
