Now that you have created the <code>mypolicy</code> policy file, 
you should be able to successfully
execute the <code>WriteFile</code> applet to create and to write the
file <code>writetest</code>, as shown in the following figure.

<br>

<p>Whenever you run an applet, or an application with a security manager, 
the policy files that are loaded and used by default are the ones 
specified in the <b>"security properties file"</b>,
which is located at one of the following:

<pre>
  <b>Windows</b>:
    <i>java.home</i>\lib\security\java.security 
  <b>UNIX</b>:
    <i>java.home</i>/lib/security/java.security
</pre>

Note that <i>java.home</i> indicates the directory into which the JDK was installed.

<p>The policy file locations are specified as the values of properties whose names 
are of the form

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.<i>n</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here <code><i>n</i></code> indicates a number. You specify each such property 
value in a line of the following form:

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.<i>n</i>=<i>URL</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here <i>URL</i> is a URL specification.
For example, the default policy files, sometimes referred to as
the system and user policy files, respectively,
are defined in the security properties file as

<blockquote>
<pre>
policy.url.1=file:${java.home}/lib/security/java.policy
policy.url.2=file:${user.home}/.java.policy
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<b>Note:</b> Use of the notation <code>${propName}</code> 
in the security properties file is a way of 
specifying the value of a property. Thus <code>${java.home}</code> will be 
replaced at runtime by the actual value of the <code>"java.home"</code> property, 
which indicates the directory into which the JDK was stored, and
<code>${user.home}</code> will be 
replaced by the value of the <code>"user.home"</code> property, for
example, <code>C:\Windows</code>.
<hr>
</blockquote>

In the <a href = "step2.html">previous step</a>
you did not modify one of these policy files. You created a policy file 
named <code>mypolicy</code>. There are two possible ways you can have the 
<code>mypolicy</code> file
be considered as part of the overall policy, in addition to the policy files specified in
the security properties file. You can either specify the additional policy file in a 
property passed to the runtime system, as described in 
<a href = "#Approach1">Approach 1</a>,
or add a line in the security properties 
file specifying the additional policy file, as discussed in
<a href = "#Approach2">Approach 2</a>.

<blockquote>
<hr>
<b>Note:</b> On a UNIX system, you must have DNS
configured in order for the <code>WriteFile</code> program
to be downloaded from the public web site as in the command
executions shown below.
You need to have <code>dns</code> 
in the list of lookup services for hosts in your
<code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code> file, as in
<pre>
    hosts:    dns files nis
</pre>
You also need a <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file
with a list of nameservers.
Consult your system administrator for more information.
<hr>
</blockquote>


<h4><a name="Approach1">Approach 1</a></h4>

<blockquote>

You can use an <code>appletviewer</code>
command-line argument, <code>-J-Djava.security.policy</code>, to specify a
policy file that should be used in addition to the ones
specified in the security properties file.
To run the <code>WriteFile</code> applet with the
<code>mypolicy</code> policy file included, type the following in the
directory in which <code>mypolicy</code> is stored:

<blockquote>
<pre>
appletviewer -J-Djava.security.policy=mypolicy  
 http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/security1.2/tour1/
 example-1dot2/WriteFile.html
</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<hr>
<b>Notes:</b> 
<ul>
<li>This must be typed as a single line, with a space between
<code>mypolicy</code> and the URL and no spaces in the URL. Multiple lines 
are used in the example just for legibility purposes. <p>

<li>If this command line is longer than the maximum number of
characters you are allowed to type on a single line, do the following.
Create a text file containing the full 
command, and name the file with a <code>.bat</code> extension,
for example, <code>wf.bat</code>. Then in your command
window simply type the name of the <code>.bat</code> file instead of the command.
This results in execution of the full command.
</ul>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p>If the applet still reports an error, 
something is wrong in the policy file.
Use the Policy Tool to open the <code>mypolicy</code> file 
(using <b>File</b> > <b>Open</b>) and
check the policy entries you just created in the
previous step, 
<a href = "step2.html">Set Up a Policy File to Grant the Required Permissions</a>. 
Change any typos or other errors.

<p>To view or edit an existing policy entry, select the line for that entry in the main 
Policy Tool window, then choose the <b>Edit Policy Entry</b> button. 
Alternatively you can simply double-click the line for that entry. 

<p>This brings up the same type of Policy Entry dialog box as appears when you 
are adding a new policy entry after choosing the <b>Add Policy Entry</b> button,
except in this case the dialog box is filled in with 
the existing policy entry information. To change the information, simply 
retype it (for the <b>CodeBase</b> and <b>SignedBy</b> 
values) or add, remove, or modify permissions. 

</blockquote>


<h4><a name="Approach2">Approach 2</a></h4>

<blockquote>

You can specify a number of URLs (including ones of the form "http://")
in <code>policy.url.n</code> properties in the security properties file, and 
all the designated policy files will get loaded. 

<p>So one way to have our <code>mypolicy</code> file's policy entry considered 
by the <code>appletviewer</code> is to add 
an entry specifying that policy file in the security properties file.

<blockquote>
<hr>
<strong>Important:</strong> If you are running your own copy of the JDK, 
you can easily edit your
security properties file. If you are running a version shared
with others, you may only be able to modify the system-wide
security properties file if you have write access to it or if you ask your
system administrator to modify the file when appropriate. However, 
it's probably not appropriate for you to make modifications to a system-wide policy file
for this tutorial test. We suggest that you just read the following to see how it's done
or that you install your own private version of the JDK to use for the tutorial
lessons.
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p>To modify the security properties file, open it in an editor suitable for editing an 
ASCII text file. Then add the following line after the line starting with
<code>policy.url.2</code>:

<pre>
  <b>Windows</b>:
    <b>policy.url.3=file:/C:/Test/mypolicy</b>
  <b>UNIX</b>:
    <b>policy.url.3=file:${user.home}/test/mypolicy</b>
</pre>

<p>On a UNIX system you can alternatively explicitly specify your home directory, as in

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>policy.url.3=file:/home/susanj/test/mypolicy</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you should be able to successfully run the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>appletviewer http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/
security1.2/tour1/example-1dot2/WriteFile.html</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Type this command on one line, without spaces in the URL.

<p>As with approach 1, if you still get a security exception, 
something is wrong in the policy file.
Use the Policy Tool to check the policy entry you just created in the
previous step, 
<a href = "step2.html">Set Up a Policy File to Grant the Required Permissions</a>. 
Change any typos or other errors.

<blockquote>
<hr>
<b>Important:</b> The <code>mypolicy</code> policy file is also used in the

<a target="_top" href="..\tour2\index.html">Quick Tour of Controlling Applications</a><a href="..\tour2\index.html"><img src="http://docs.rinet.ru/Jtuta/images/jdk1-2.gif" width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="(in the Java Security 1.2 trail)"></a>
lesson. If you will not be doing that lesson, you may want to
delete the line you just added in the
security properties file (or comment it out)</b>, since you probably
do not want the <code>mypolicy</code> file included when you are not running 
the tutorial lessons.
