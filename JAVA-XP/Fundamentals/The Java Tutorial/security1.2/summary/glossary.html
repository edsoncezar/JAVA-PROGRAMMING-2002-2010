<h2>
    Glossary

<p>
<blockquote>


Below are definitions and explanations of some general security and
JDK security-specific terms and concepts, in alphabetic order.

<dl>

<dt><b><a name="Certificate">Certificate</a></b><p>

<dd>A certificate is a 
<a href = "#DigitalSignature">digitally signed</a> statement from
one entity (person, company, etc.), saying that the 
<a href = "#PublicKey">public key</a> of some
other entity has some particular value.
If you trust the signature on the certificate, you trust that the
association in the certificate between the specified public key and
the other entity is authentic.<p>


<dt><b>Cryptography Algorithm</b><p>

<dd>A cryptography algorithm is an algorithm used to help ensure one or
more of the following:<p>

<ol>

<li>the confidentiality of data <p>

<li>authentication of the data sender <p>

<li>integrity of the data sent<p>

<li>nonrepudiation; a sender cannot deny having sent a particular message<p>

</ul>

<p>A <a href = "#DigitalSignature">digital signature</a> algorithm provides some of these characteristics. Also see 
<a href = "#MessageDigest">message digest</a> algorithms. Digital signature and message digest algorithms are available in JDK 1.1.

<p>A separate release (Java Cryptography Extensions) provides APIs and 
algorithms related to <a href = "#Encryption"><i>encryption</i></a> and 
<a href = "#Decryption"><i>decryption</i></a>.<p>


<dt><b><a name="Decryption">Decryption</a></b><p>

<dd>Decryption is the inverse of 
<a href = "#Encryption">encryption</a>; the process of taking ciphertext 
(encrypted data) 
and a cryptographic key, and producing cleartext  (the original
unencrypted data). <p>


<dt><b><a name="DigitalSignature">Digital Signature</a></b><p>

<dd>A digital signature is a string of bits that is computed from some data (the data
being "signed") and the <a href = "#PrivateKey">private key</a> of an entity.  

The signature can be used to verify that the data came from the entity
and was not modified in transit. 

<p>Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature has many
useful characteristics:<p>

<ul>

<li>Its authenticity can be verified, via a computation that
uses the <a href = "#PublicKey">public key</a> corresponding to the 
private key used to generate the signature.<p>

<li>It cannot be forged, assuming the private key is kept secret.<p>

<li>It is a function of the data signed and thus can't be 
claimed to be the signature for other data as well.<p>

<li>The signed data cannot be changed; if it is, the signature
will no longer verify as being authentic.<p>

</ul>


<dt><b><a name="Domain">Domain or Protection Domain</a></b><p>

<dd>A protection domain ("domain" for short) encloses a set of classes whose instances
 are granted the same set of permissions.
 
 <p>In addition to a set of permissions, a domain is comprised of a 
 <code>CodeSource</code>, which is a set of <code>PublicKey</code>s 
together with a codebase (in 
 the form of a URL). Thus, classes signed by the same keys and
 from the same URL are placed in the same domain.
 Classes that have the same permissions but are from different code
 sources belong to different domains.

<p>Currently in JDK 1.2, protection domains are created 
"on demand" as a result of class loading.  

<p>Today all code shipped as part of the JDK is considered system code and 
runs inside the unique system domain. Each applet or application runs in its 
appropriate domain, determined by its code source.

<p>


<dt><b><a name="Encryption">Encryption</a></b><p>

<dd>Encryption is the process of taking data (called <i>cleartext</i>)
and a cryptographic <i>key</i> and producing <i>ciphertext</i>, 
which is data meaningless to anybody who does not know the key.<p>


<dt><b><a name="Engine">Engine Class</a></b><p>

<dd><P>
An "engine class" defines a cryptographic service
in an abstract fashion (without a concrete implementation).

<p>A cryptographic service is always associated with a particular algorithm or type,
and it either provides cryptographic operations (like those for digital
signatures or message digests), generates or supplies the
cryptographic material (keys or parameters) required for cryptographic 
operations, or generates data objects
(keystores or certificates) that encapsulate cryptographic
keys (which can be used in a cryptographic operation)
in a secure fashion. For example, two of the engine classes are the <code>Signature</code>
and <code>KeyFactory</code> classes. The <code>Signature</code> 
class provides access to the functionality of a
digital signature algorithm.
A DSA <code>KeyFactory</code> supplies a DSA private
or public key (from its encoding or transparent specification)
in a format usable by the <code>initSign</code> or <code>initVerify</code> methods,
respectively, of a DSA <code>Signature</code> object.

<p>API clients request and utilize 
instances of the engine classes to carry out corresponding operations. 
The following engine classes are defined in JDK 1.2:<p>

<ul>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#MessageDigest"><code>MessageDigest</code></a> - used 
to calculate the message digest (hash) of specified data.<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#Signature"><code>Signature</code></a> - used to sign data
and verify digital signatures.<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#KPG"><code>KeyPairGenerator</code></a> - used to generate a pair of 
public and private keys suitable for a specified algorithm.<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#KeyFactory"><code>KeyFactory</code></a> - used to
convert <a href = "#OpaqueKey">opaque</a> cryptographic keys of type <a href = "#Key">Key</a> 
into <i>key specifications</i> (<a href = "#TransparentKey">transparent</a>
representations of the underlying
key material), and vice versa.<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#CertificateFactory"><code>CertificateFactory</code>
</a> - used to
create public key certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#KeyStore"><code>KeyStore</code></a>
 - used to create and manage a 
<i>keystore</i>. A keystore is a database of keys. Private keys in a keystore 
have a certificate chain associated with them, which authenticates 
the corresponding public key.
A keystore also contains certificates from trusted entities.
<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#AlgorithmParameters"><code>AlgorithmParameters</code>
</a> - used 
to manage the parameters for a particular algorithm, including
parameter encoding and decoding.<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#AlgorithmParameterGenerator"><code>AlgorithmParameterGenerator</code>
</a>
- used to generate a set of parameters suitable for a
specified algorithm.<p>

<li><a href = "apicore.html#SecureRandom"><code>SecureRandom</code>
</a> - used to generate random
or pseudo-random numbers.

</ul>
 
<p>
An engine class provides the interface to the functionality of a
specific type of cryptographic service (independent
of a particular cryptographic algorithm). 
It defines "Application Programming Interface" (API)
methods that allow applications to access the specific type
of cryptographic service it provides. The actual implementations 
(from one or more providers) are those for specific
algorithms.  The <code>Signature</code> engine
class, for example, provides access to the functionality of a
digital signature algorithm. The actual implementation supplied
in a <code>SignatureSpi</code> subclass (see next paragraph) would be that 
for a specific kind of signature
algorithm, such as SHA1 with DSA, SHA1 with RSA, MD5 with RSA,
or even some proprietary signature algorithm. 

<p>
The application interfaces supplied by an engine class are
implemented in terms of a <b>"Service Provider Interface" (SPI)</b>.
That is, for each engine class, there is a corresponding
abstract SPI class, which defines the Service Provider 
Interface methods that cryptographic service providers must implement.

<p>An instance of an engine class is created by a call to the
<code>getInstance</code> factory method of that engine class, which encapsulates
the selected provider's SPI implementation in it and returns it to
the caller. Each API method of the generated engine class instance
invokes the corresponding SPI method of the encapsulated SPI object.

<p>The name of each SPI class is the same as that of the corresponding 
engine class, followed by "Spi". For example,
the SPI class corresponding to the <code>Signature</code> engine class is the
<code>SignatureSpi</code> class.<p>


<dt><b><a name="MessageDigest">Message Digest Algorithm (or One-Way Hash Function)</a></b><p>

<dd>A message digest is a function that
takes arbitrary-sized input data (referred to as a <i>message</i>)
and generates a fixed-size
output, called a <I>digest</I> (or hash). A digest 
has the following properties:<p>

<UL>
<LI>It should be computationally infeasible to find another input
string that will generate the same digest.<p>
<LI>The digest does not reveal anything about the input that was
used to generate it.
</UL>

<p>Message digest algorithms are used to produce unique and 
reliable identifiers
of data. The digests are sometimes called the "digital fingerprints"
of data.

<P>Some <a href = "#DigitalSignature">digital signature</a> algorithms 
use a message digest algorithm to
compute the hash of the data that is being signed, and then digitally
sign the hash value rather than the original data, since digitally signing
the original data could be very expensive.

<p>


<dt><b><a name="OpaqueKey">Opaque Key Representation</a></b><p>

<dd><p>An <i>opaque</i> key representation is one in which
you have no direct access to the key material that constitues a key.
In other words: "opaque" gives you limited access to the key - just
the three methods defined by the "Key" interface: 
<code>getAlgorithm</code>, <code>getFormat</code>, and <code>getEncoded</code>.

<p>This is in contrast to a
<a href="#TransparentKey"><i>transparent</i></a> representation, 
in which you can access
each key material value individually, through one of the "get" methods defined
in the corresponding specification class.

<p>


<dt><b><a name="OpaqueParm">Opaque Parameter Representation</a></b><p>

<dd><p>An <i>opaque</i> parameter representation is one in which
you have no direct access to the parameter fields;
you can only get the name of the algorithm associated with the
parameter set and some kind of encoding for the 
parameter set. This is in contrast to a
<a href="#TransparentParm"><i>transparent</i></a>
representation of parameters, in which you can access
each value individually, through one of the "get" methods defined
in the corresponding specification class.

<p>


<dt><b><a name="Permission">Permission</a></b><p>

<dd><p>A permission represents access to a system resource.
In order for a resource access to be allowed for an applet
(or an application running with a security manager),
the corresponding permission must be explicitly granted
the code attempting the access.

<p>The policy in effect for a Java application environment
specifies which permissions 
are available for code from various sources (see
<a href = "#Policy"><code>Policy</code></a>).

<p>A permission typically has a name (often referred to as a
"target name") and, in some cases, a comma-separated list of
one or more actions. 

<p>The JDK has a number of built-in
permission types (classes), and new types may be added by clients.<p>


<dt><b><a name="Policy">Policy</a></b><p>

<dd><p>The policy in effect for a Java application environment
specifies which <a href = "#Permission">permissions</a> are available 
for code from various sources.

<p>The source location for the policy information is up to the Policy implementation.
The JDK contains a default Policy implementation that obtains its
information from static policy configuration files.<p>



<dt><b><a name="PolicyFile">Policy File</a></b><p>

<dd>The policy for a Java application environment (specifying which permissions 
are available for code from various sources) is represented 
by a <a href = "apicore.html#Policy"><code>Policy</code></a> object.

<p>The source location for the policy information utilized by the
<code>Policy</code> object is up to the <code>Policy</code> implementation.
JDK 1.2 has a default <code>Policy</code> implementation that obtains its
information from static "policy configuration files", also
known simply as "policy files".<p>


<dt><b><a name="PrivateKey">Private Key</a></b><p>

<dd>A private key is a number that is supposed to be known only to a particular 
entity. That is, private keys are always meant to be kept secret.
They can be used to generate 
<a href = "#DigitalSignature">digital signatures</a>.
A private key is always associated with a single 
<a href = "#PublicKey">public key</a>.<p>


<dt><b><a name="Privileged">Privileged</a></b><p>

<dd>Whenever a resource access is attempted, <i>all</i> code 
traversed by the execution thread up to that point must have permission 
for that resource access, unless some code on the thread has been marked 
as "privileged". That is, suppose access control checking occurs in a thread 
of execution that has a chain of multiple callers. 
When the 
<a href = "apicore.html#AccessController"><code>AccessController</code></a> <code>checkPermission</code> method is 
invoked by the most recent caller, the basic algorithm for deciding whether to 
allow or deny the requested access is as follows:

<p>If the domain for any caller in the call chain does not have the requested 
permission, <code>AccessControlException</code> is thrown, unless the 
following is true:
a caller whose domain is granted the said permission has been marked as 
"privileged" (see below) and all parties subsequently called by this caller 
(directly or indirectly) all have the said permission.

<p>(Note: System code automatically has all permissions.)

<p>Marking code as "privileged" enables a piece of trusted code to
temporarily enable access to more resources than are available directly to
the code that called it. This is necessary in some situations. For
example, an application may not be allowed direct access to files that
contain fonts, but the system utility to display a document must obtain
those fonts, on behalf of the user. In order to do this, the system utility 
becomes privileged while obtaining the fonts.

<p>



<dt><b><a name="ProtectionDomain">Protection Domain</a></b><p>

<dd>See <a href = "#Domain">Domain</a>.<p>


<dt><b><a name="Provider">Provider</a></b><p>

<dd><P>
Implementations for various cryptography algorithms are provided by 
<i>Cryptographic Service Providers</i>. Providers 
are essentially packages that implement one or more 
<a href = "#Engine">engine classes</a> for specific algorithms. For example, 
the Java Development
Kit's default provider, named "SUN", supplies implementations
of the DSA signature algorithm and of the MD5 and SHA-1 message digest
algorithms. Other providers may define their own implementations of
these algorithms or of other algorithms,
such as an implementation of an RSA-based signature algorithm or the
MD2 message digest algorithm.<p>


<dt><b><a name="PublicKey">Public Key</a></b><p>

<dd>A public key is a  number associated with a
particular entity (for example, an individual or an organization).
A public key is intended to be known to everyone
who needs to have trusted interactions with that entity.
A public key is always associated with a single
<a href = "#PrivateKey">private key</a>, and can be 
used to verify digital signatures
generated using that private key.<p>


<dt><b><a name="SecurityManager">Security Manager</a></b><p>

<dd>Currently, all JDK system code invokes security manager methods to check the 
<a href = "#Policy">policy</a> currently in effect and perform access control checks. 
There is typically a security manager 
(<code>SecurityManager</code> implementation) installed 
whenever an applet is running; the <code>appletviewer</code> and most browsers, 
including those from Netscape and Microsoft, install a security manager.
The security manager prevents applet code from accessing resources unless 
it is explicitly granted permission to do so by an entry in a policy file.

<p>A security manager is <i>not</i> automatically installed when an <i>application</i> is 
running, and thus the
application has full access to resources (as was always the case in JDK 1.1).
To apply the same security policy to an application found on the local file 
system as to downloaded applets, either the user running the application must invoke 
the Java Virtual Machine with the new "-Djava.security.manager" 
command-line argument or the application itself must call the <code>setSecurityManager</code> method in the 
<code>java.lang.System</code> class to install a security manager.<p>


<dt><b><a name="SelfCert">Self-Signed Certificate</a></b><p>

<dd>A self-signed <a href = "#Certificate">certificate</a> is one for
which the issuer (signer) is the same as the subject (the entity
whose public key is being authenticated by the certificate).<p>


<dt><b><a name="Signature">Signature</a></b><p>

<dd>See <a href = "#DigitalSignature">Digital Signature</a>.<p>


<dt><b><a name="SignedCode">Signed Code</a></b><p>

<dd>An abbreviated way of saying "code in a class file that appears in
a JAR file that was signed". See <a href = "#DigitalSignature">Digital Signature</a>.<p>

<p>


<dt><b><a name="TransparentKey">Transparent Key Representation</a></b><p>

<dd><p>A <i>transparent</i> representation of keys means that you can access
each key material value individually, through one of the "get" methods defined
in the corresponding specification class. For example, DSAPrivateKeySpec
defines <code>getX</code>, <code>getP</code>, <code>getQ</code>, and
<code>getG</code> methods, to access the private key <code>x</code>, 
and the DSA algorithm
parameters used to calculate the key: the prime <code>p</code>, 
the sub-prime <code>q</code>, and the base <code>g</code>.

<p>This is in contrast to an
<a href="#OpaqueKey"><i>opaque</i></a> representation, as defined by the 
Key interface, in which you have no direct access to the key material fields.

<p>

<dt><b><a name="TransparentParm">Transparent Parameter Representation</a></b><p>

<dd><p>A <i>transparent</i> representation of a set of parameters 
means that you can access
each parameter value in the set individually, through one of the "get" methods defined
in the corresponding specification class. For example, DSAParameterSpec
defines <code>getP</code>, <code>getQ</code>, and
<code>getG</code> methods, to access the DSA community parameters
p, q, and g, respectively.

<p>This is contrasted with an 
<a href="#OpaqueParm"><i>opaque</i></a> representation, as supplied by the 
AlgorithmParameters class, in which
you have no direct access to the parameter fields;
you can only get the name of the algorithm associated with the
parameter set (via <code>getAlgorithm</code>) and some kind of encoding for the 
parameter set (via <code>getEncoded</code>).
