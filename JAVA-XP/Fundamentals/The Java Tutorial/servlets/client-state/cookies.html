<h2>
    Using Cookies
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>Cookies are a way for a server (or a servlet, as part of a server) to
send some information to a client to store, and for the server to later
retrieve its data from that client.  Servlets send cookies to clients by
adding fields to HTTP response headers.  Clients automatically return
cookies by adding fields to HTTP request headers.

<p>Each HTTP request and response header is named and has a single value.
For example, a cookie could be a header named <code>BookToBuy</code> with a
value <code>304qty1</code>, indicating to the calling application that the
user wants to buy one copy of the book with stock number 304.  (Cookies and
their values are application-specific.)

<p>Multiple cookies can have the same name.  For example, a servlet could
send two cookies with headers named <code>BookToBuy</code>; one could have
the value shown previously, <code>304qty1</code>, while the other could
have a value <code>301qty3</code>.  These cookies would indicate that the
user wants to buy one copy of the book with stock number 304, and three
copies of the book with stock number 301.

<p>In addition to a name and a value, you can also provide optional
attributes such as comments.  Current web browsers do not always treat the
optional attributes correctly, so you should not rely on them.

<p>A server can provide one or more cookies to a client.  Client software,
such as a web browser, is expected to support twenty cookies per host, of
at least four kilobytes each

<p>When you send a cookie to a client, standard HTTP/1.0 caches will not
cache the page.  Currently, the <code>javax.servlet.http.Cookie</code> does
not support HTTP/1.1 cache control models.

<p>Cookies that a client stores for a server are returned by the client to
that server and only that server.  A server can contain multiple servlets;
the <b>Duke's Bookstore</b> example is made up of multiple servlets running
within a single server.  Because cookies are returned to a <i>server</i>,
servlets running within a server share cookies.  The examples in this
section illustrate this by showing the <code>CatalogServlet</code> and
<code>ShowCart</code> servlet working with the same cookies.

<p>

<hr>
<b>Note</b>: This section shows code that is not a part of the <b>Duke's
Bookstore</b> example.  <b>Duke's Bookstore</b> could use code like that
shown in this lesson if it used cookies instead of session tracking to keep
track of the client's book order.  Because cookies are not a part of
<b>Duke's Bookstore</b>, think of the examples in this section as
pseudo-code.

<li><a href="#set-val">Set any attributes</a> <br>&nbsp;

<li><a href="#send">Send the cookie</a> <br>&nbsp;

</ol>

<p>To get information from a cookie, <br>&nbsp;

<ol>

<li><a href="#get-cookie">Retrieve all the cookies</a> from the user's
request <br>&nbsp;

<li>Find the cookie or cookies with the name that you are interested in, using
standard programming techniques <br>&nbsp

<li><a href="#get-value">Get the values of the cookies</a> that you found
<br>&nbsp;

</ol>

<h3><a name="create">Creating a Cookie</a></h3>

<p>The constructor for the<code>javax.servlet.http.Cookie</code> class creates
a cookie with an initial name and value.  You can change the value of the
cookie later with its <code>setValue</code> method.

<p>The name of the cookie must be an HTTP/1.1 <i>token</i>.  Tokens are
strings that contain none of the special characters listed in <a
href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2068.txt">RFC
2068</a>.  (Alphanumeric strings qualify as tokens.) In addition, names
that start with the dollar-sign character ("<code>$</code>") are reserved
by <a
href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2109.txt">RFC
2109</a>.

<p>The value of the cookie can be any string, though null values are not
guaranteed to work the same way on all browsers.  In addition, if you are
sending a cookie that complies with Netscape's original cookie specification,
do not use whitespace or any of these characters:

<blockquote>
<code>[ ] ( ) = , " / ? @ : ;</code>
</blockquote>

<p>If your servlet returns a response to the user with a <code>Writer</code>,
create the cookie before accessing the <code>Writer</code>.  (Because cookies
are sent to the client as a header, and headers must be written before
accessing the <code>Writer</code>.)

<p>If the <code>CatalogServlet</code> used cookies to keep track of a
client's book order, the servlet could create cookies like this:

<pre>
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response)
	throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        BookDBServlet database = (BookDBServlet)
            getServletConfig().getServletContext().getServlet("bookdb");

        // Check for pending adds to the shopping cart
        String bookId = request.getParameter("Buy");

        //If the user wants to add a book, remember it by adding a cookie
        if (bookId != null) {
            <b>Cookie getBook = new Cookie("Buy", bookId);</b>
            ...
        }

	// set content-type header before accessing the Writer
        response.setContentType("text/html");

        // now get the writer and write the data of the response
	PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
        out.println("&lt;html&gt;" +
                    "&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt; Book Catalog &lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;" + ...);
        ...
    }

</pre>

<br>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="set-val">Setting Cookie Attributes</a></h3>

<p>The <code>Cookie</code> class provides a number of methods for setting a
cookie's values and attributes.  Using these methods is straightforward;
they are explained in the javadoc for <code>Cookie</code> class.

<p>The following example sets the comment field of the
<code>CatalogServlet</code>'s cookie.  The comment field describes the
purpose of the cookie.

<pre>
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response)
	throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        ...
        //If the user wants to add a book, remember it by adding a cookie
        if (values != null) {
            bookId = values[0];
            Cookie getBook = new Cookie("Buy", bookId);
            <b>getBook.setComment("User wants to buy this book " +
                               "from the bookstore.");</b>
        }
        ...
    }

</pre>

<p>You can also set the maximum age of the cookie.  This attribute is
useful, for example, for deleting a cookie.  Once again, if <b>Duke's
Bookstore</b> kept track of a user's order with cookies, the example would
use this attribute to delete a book from the user's order.  The user
removes a book from the shopping cart in the <code>ShowCartServlet</code>;
its code would look something like this:

<pre>
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response)
	throws ServletException, IOException
    {
	...
        /* Handle any pending deletes from the shopping cart */
        String bookId = request.getParameter("Remove");
        ...        
        if (bookId != null) {
            // Find the cookie that pertains to the book to remove
            ...
                    // Delete the cookie by setting its maximum age to zero
                    <b>thisCookie.setMaxAge(0);</b>
            ...
        }
            
	// also set content type header before accessing the Writer
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        //Print out the response
        out.println("&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;" +
                    "&lt;title&gt;Your Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;" + ...);
</pre>

<br>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="send">Sending the Cookie</a></h3>

<p>Cookies are sent as headers of the response to the client; they are added
with the <code>addCookie</code> method of the <code>HttpServletResponse</code>
class.  If you are using a <code>Writer</code> to return text data to the
client, you must call the <code>addCookie</code> method <i>before</i> calling
the <code>HttpServletResponse</code>'s <code>getWriter</code> method.

<p>Continuing the example of the <code>CatalogServlet</code>, the following
is code for sending the cookie:

<pre>
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response)
	throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        ...
        //If the user wants to add a book, remember it by adding a cookie
        if (values != null) {
            bookId = values[0];
            Cookie getBook = new Cookie("Buy", bookId);
            getBook.setComment("User has indicated a desire " +
                               "to buy this book from the bookstore.");
            <b>response.addCookie(getBook);</b>
        }
        ...
    }

</pre>


<br>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="get-cookie">Retrieving Cookies</a></h3>

<p>Clients return cookies as fields added to HTTP request headers.  To
retrieve any cookie, you must retrieve all the cookies using the
<code>getCookies</code> method of the <code>HttpServletRequest</code>
class.

<p>The <code>getCookies</code> method returns an array of <code>Cookie</code>
objects, which you can search to find the cookie or cookies that you want.
(Remember that multiple cookies can have the same name.  To get the name of a
cookie, use its <code>getName</code> method.)

<p>To continue the <code>ShowCartServlet</code> example:
<pre>
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response)
	throws ServletException, IOException
    {
	...

        /* Handle any pending deletes from the shopping cart */
        String bookId = request.getParameter("Remove");
        ...        
        if (bookId != null) {
            
            // Find the cookie that pertains to the book to remove
            <b>Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();</b>
            ...

            // Delete the book's cookie by setting its maximum age to zero
            <b>thisCookie.setMaxAge(0);</b>
        }
            
	// also set content type header before accessing the Writer
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        //Print out the response
        out.println("&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;" +
                    "&lt;title&gt;Your Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;" + ...);
</pre>

<br>&nbsp;
<h3><a name="get-value">Getting the Value of a Cookie</a></h3>

<p>To find the value of a cookie, use its <code>getValue</code> method.  To
continue the <code>ShowCartServlet</code> example:

<pre>
    public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request,
                       HttpServletResponse response)
	throws ServletException, IOException
    {
        ...
        /* Handle any pending deletes from the shopping cart */
        String bookId = request.getParameter("Remove");
        ...        
        if (bookId != null) {
            // Find the cookie that pertains to that book
            Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();
            for(i=0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
                Cookie thisCookie = cookie[i];
                if (thisCookie.getName().equals("Buy") &&
                    <b>thisCookie.getValue().equals(bookId)</b>) {

                    // Delete the cookie by setting its maximum age to zero
                    thisCookie.setMaxAge(0);
                }
            }
        }
            
	// also set content type header before accessing the Writer
        response.setContentType("text/html");
        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();

        //Print out the response
        out.println("&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;" +
                    "&lt;title&gt;Your Shopping Cart&lt;/title&gt;" + ...);
</pre>
