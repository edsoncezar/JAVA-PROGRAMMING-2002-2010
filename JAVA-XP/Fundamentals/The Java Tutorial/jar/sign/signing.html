<h2>
    Signing JAR Files
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

The Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> Development Kit 
contains the tools that you need to sign JAR files. Depending on which 
version of the Java Development Kit you're using, you will use either:
<ul>
<li>the JDK 1.2 <a href="#jarsigner">JAR Signing and Verification Tool</a>
<li>the JDK 1.1 <a href="#javakey">Java Security Tool</a>
</ul>

<h3>The JDK 1.2 JAR Signing and Verification Tool</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
The JAR Signing and Verification Tool is invoked by using the 
<tt>jarsigner</tt> command, so we'll refer to it as "Jarsigner" 
for short.
<p>
To sign a JAR file, you must first have a private key. 
Private keys and their associated public-key certificates are stored 
in password-protected databases called <em>keystores</em>.  A keystore 
can hold the keys of many potential signers.   Each key in the 
keystore can be 
identified by an <em>alias</em> which is typically the name of the 
signer who owns the key.  The key belonging to Rita Jones 
might have the alias "rita", for example.

<p>
The basic form of the command for signing a JAR file is 
<blockquote>
<pre>
jarsigner <i>jar-file alias</i>
</pre></blockquote>
In this command:
<ul>
<li><tt>jar-file</tt> is the pathname of the JAR file that's to 
be signed. 
<li><tt>alias</tt> is the alias identifying the private key 
that's to be used to sign the JAR file, and the key's associated certificate.
</ul>
<p>
The Jarsigner tool will prompt you for the passwords for the keystore 
and alias.  
<p>
This basic form of the command assumes that the keystore to be used 
is in a file named <tt>.keystore</tt> in your home directory.  It 
will create signature and signature block files with names <tt>x.SF</tt> 
and <tt>x.DSA</tt> respectively, where <tt>x</tt> is the first eight 
letters of the alias, all converted to upper case. This basic command 
will <em>overwrite</em> the original JAR file with the signed JAR file. 
<p>
In practice, you may want to use this command in conjunction with 
one or more of these options, which must precede the <tt>jar-file</tt> 
pathname:

<table cellspacing=3 border=1>

<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-keystore</tt>&nbsp;<i>url</i></td><td>Specifies a keystore to 
be used if you don't want to use the <tt>.keystore</tt> default 
database.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-storepass</tt>&nbsp;<i>password</i></td><td>Allows you to enter 
the keystore's password on the command line rather than be prompted for it.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-keypass</tt>&nbsp;<i>password</i></td><td>Allows you to enter your 
alias's password on the command line rather than be prompted for it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-sigfile</tt>&nbsp;<i>file</i></td><td>Specifies the base name for 
the .SF and .DSA files if you don't want the base name to be taken 
from your alias. <i>file</i> must be composed only of 
upper case letters (A-Z), numerals (0-9), hyphen (-), and underscore (_).</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-signedjar</tt>&nbsp;<i>file</i></td><td>Specifies the name of the 
signed JAR file to be generated if you don't want the original unsigned 
file to be overwritten with the signed file.</td></tr>
</table>

</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>
<blockquote>
Let's look at a couple of examples of signing a JAR file with the 
Jarsigner tool.  In these examples we will assume:
<ul>
<li>your alias is "johndoe".
<li>the keystore you want to use is in a file named "mykeys" in the current 
working directory.
<li>the keystore's password is "abc123".
<li>the password for your alias is "mypass".
</ul>

Under these assumptions, you could use this command to sign a JAR file named <tt>app.jar</tt>:
<blockquote>
<pre>
jarsigner -keystore mykeys -storepass abc123 
          -keypass mypass app.jar johndoe
</blockquote></pre>
<p>
Because this command doesn't make use of the <tt>-sigfile</tt> option, 
the .SF and .DSA files it creates would be named <tt>JOHNDOE.SF</tt> and 
<tt>JOHNDOE.DSA</tt>. Because the command doesn't use the <tt>-signedjar</tt> 
option, the resulting signed file will overwrite the original version 
of <tt>app.jar</tt>.
<p>
Let's look at what would happen if you used a different combination 
of options:
<blockquote>
<pre>
jarsigner -keystore mykeys -sigfile SIG 
          -signedjar SignedApp.jar app.jar johndoe
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
This time, you would be prompted to enter the passwords for both the 
keystore and your alias because the passwords aren't specified on the 
command line.  The signature and 
signature block files would be named <tt>SIG.SF</tt> and 
<tt>SIG.DSA</tt>, respectively, and the signed JAR file 
<tt>SignedApp.jar</tt> would be placed in the current directory. The 
original unsigned JAR file would remain unchanged.

<h3>The JDK 1.1 Java Security Tool</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
If you're working with version 1.1 of the Java Development Kit, you'll use
the Java Security Tool to sign JAR files.  You invoke the Java Security 
Tool with the <tt>javakey</tt> command, so we'll call it  
"Javakey" for short.
<p>
The Javakey tool manages a database containing public/private key 
pairs and related certificates.  In order to sign a JAR file with 
the Javakey tool, you need to have a public/private key pair in Javakey's  
database.  The Javakey tool will look for the database at the location 
specified by the <tt>identity.database</tt> property in the security 
properties file, <tt>java.security</tt>, located in the 
<tt>jre/lib/security</tt> directory of the JDK software. The database 
typically holds 
key pairs for many different potential signers, each key pair being 
associated with the username of a signer.
<p>
In addition to key pairs, Javakey's database contains certificates for 
the public keys.  When a certificate is added to the database, Javakey 
assigns it a unique number for identification purposes.
<p>
To sign a file, you must provide Javakey with several pieces of 
information:
<ul>
<li>the username of the key pair to use
<li>the number of the certificate to use
<li>the name that the signature and signature block files are to have
<li>the name that the signed JAR file is to have
</ul>
<p>
You provide this information to Javakey by using a 
<em>directive file</em>, which is basically a property 
file that Javakey reads when signing a JAR file.  Here's a sample 
directive file:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# The signer property specifies the username corresponding to 
# the key pair that Javakey is to use to sign the JAR file.  
# In this example, Javakey will sign the file using the key pair 
# belonging to user "rita". 

signer=rita

# The cert property tells Javakey which certificate to use. Each 
# certificate in Javakey's database is identified by a number. 
# To see a list of all the certificates and associated numbers in 
# the database, use the command 'javakey -ld'.

cert=1

# The signature.file property specifies the name that the signature 
# file and signature block file are to have.  In this example, 
# the files will be named SIGFILE.SF and SIGFILE.DSA, respectively. 

signature.file=sigfile

# The out.file property specifies the name that Javakey should give 
# to the signed JAR file it produces.  This property is optional. 
# If it's not present, Javakey will give the signed file the name 
# of the original JAR file, but with a .sig filename extension.

out.file=rita.jar
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Once your directive file is ready, you sign a JAR file 
by using a command of this form:
<blockquote>
<pre>
javakey -gs <i>directive-file jar-file</i>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In this command:
<ul>
<li><tt>-gs</tt> is the option that tells Javakey to 
sign a JAR file.
<li><tt>directive-file</tt> is the pathname of the directive file 
that Javakey should use.
<li><tt>jar-file</tt> is the pathname of the JAR file that you 
want to sign.
</ul>
<p>
Javakey will place the signed JAR file in the current directory.
<p>
Javakey can perform many other functions related to managing the 
key/certificate database.  See the on-line JDK documentation for 
more information about Javakey:
