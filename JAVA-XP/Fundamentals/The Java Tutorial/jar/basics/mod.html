<h2>
    Modifying a Manifest File
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>

You can modify the contents of a JAR file in a couple of ways. 
One method, available in both versions 1.1 and 
1.2 of the Jar tool, uses the <tt>m</tt> command-line option to 
add custom information to the manifest during creation of a 
JAR file.  The <tt>m</tt> option is described in this section. 
<p>
Version 1.2 of the Jar tool also provides a <tt>u</tt> option 
which you can used to update the contents of an existing JAR file, 
including its manifest. The <tt>u</tt> option is covered in the 
section called <a href="update.html">Updating a JAR File</a>.
<p>
The Jar tool automatically puts a default manifest with pathname 
<tt>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</tt> into any JAR file you create. You can 
enable special JAR file functionality, such as package sealing, by 
modifying the default manifest. 
Typically, this involves adding special-purpose <i>headers</i> to the 
manifest that allow the JAR file to perform a particular desired 
function.  For 
examples of some special-purpose headers, and for more information 
about manifest files in general, see the  
<a href="manifest.html#special-purpose">Understanding the Manifest</a> 
section of this lesson.
<p>
The Jar tool's <tt>m</tt> option allows you to add information to 
the default manifest during creation of a JAR file. You must first 
prepare a text file containing the information you wish to add to the 
default manifest. You can then use the Jar tool's <tt>m</tt> option to 
add the information in your file to the default manifest.
<p>
The basic command has this format:
<blockquote>
<pre>
jar cmf <i>manifest-addition jar-file input-file(s)</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Let's look at the options and arguments used in this command:
<ul>
<li>The <tt>c</tt> option indicates that you want to <em>create</em> 
a JAR file.
<li>The <tt>m</tt> option indicates that you want to merge 
information from an existing <em>manifest</em> file into the manifest 
file of the JAR file you're creating.
<li>The <tt>f</tt> option indicates that you want the output to go to 
a <em>file</em> (the JAR file you're creating) rather than to stdout.
<li><tt>manifest-addition</tt> is the name (or path and name) of the existing 
text file whose contents you want included in the JAR file's 
manifest. 
<li><tt>jar-file</tt> is the name that you want the resulting JAR 
file to have.
<li>The <tt>input-file(s)</tt> argument is a space-delimited list 
of one or more files that you want to be placed in your JAR file.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>c</tt>, <tt>m</tt>, and <tt>f</tt> options can appear in any  
order, but there must not be any whitespace between them.

<h3>An Example</h3>

<blockquote>
In version 1.2 of the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> platform, 
packages within JAR files can be optionally sealed, which means 
that all classes defined in that package must be archived in the same JAR 
file.  You might want to seal a package, for example, to ensure 
version consistency among the classes in your software. 
<p>
A package can be sealed by adding the <tt>Sealed</tt> header 
beneath the header naming the package that's to be sealed.:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Name: myCompany/myPackage/
Sealed: true
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The default manifest created by the Jar tool does not contain any 
<tt>Sealed</tt> headers, of course, because packages are not sealed 
by default. To seal a package, you therefore have to add the 
<tt>Sealed</tt> header yourself. 
To insert the <tt>Sealed</tt> header in a JAR file's manifest, you 
first need to write a text file containing the 
appropriate headers.  The file you write doesn't have to be 
a complete manifest file; it can contain just enough information for 
the Jar tool to know where and what information to merge into the 
default manifest.  
<p>
Let's suppose, for example, that your JAR file is to contain these 
four packages:
<blockquote>
<pre>
myCompany/firstPackage/
myCompany/secondPackage/
myCompany/thirdPackage/
myCompany/fourthPackage/
</pre></blockquote>
To seal <tt>firstPackage</tt> and <tt>thirdPackage</tt>, you would write 
a text file with contents that look like this:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Name: myCompany/firstPackage/
Sealed: true

Name: myCompany/thirdPackage/
Sealed: true
</pre></blockquote>
Note that the package names end with a "<tt>/</tt>". This file 
contains the information that needs to be added to the default 
manifest to seal the desired packages. Each <tt>Sealed</tt> header is 
immediately preceeded by a <tt>Name</tt> header that indicates 
which package is to be sealed.
<p>
Let's suppose that:
<ul>
<li>you named your text file <tt>sealInfo</tt>
<li>the JAR file you want to create will have the name 
<tt>myJar.jar</tt>
<li>the current directory is the parent directory of <tt>myCompany</tt>
</ul>
<p>
You would create the JAR file with this command:
<blockquote>
<pre>
jar cmf sealInfo myJar.jar myCompany
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The precise look of the resulting manifest file in <tt>myJar.jar</tt> 
would depend upon whether you were using version 1.1 or version 1.2 
of the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> Development Kit. In 
either case, the <tt>Sealed</tt> header would be included for 
<tt>firstPackage</tt> and <tt>thirdPackage</tt>. If you were using 
the version 1.2 Jar tool, the manifest would look like this:
<blockquote><pre>
Manifest-Version: 1.0

Name: myCompany/firstPackage/
Sealed: true

Name: myCompany/thirdPackage/
Sealed: true
</pre></blockquote>
Only the first line, <tt>Manifest-Version:&nbsp;1.0</tt>, is part of 
the default manifest. The other lines are in the manifest because 
you added them when the Jar file was created by using the <tt>m</tt> 
option.
