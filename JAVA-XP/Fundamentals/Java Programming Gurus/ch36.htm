<P>
Java's sudden appearance and rapid rise to prominence on the software
scene are nothing short of remarkable, and the excitement doesn't
look like it's going to wear off soon. Making predictions about
something that's moving so quickly is hard. Clearly, Java will
be genuinely important, not just a momentary fad. Beyond that,
little is certain.
<P>
Nevertheless, <I>Tricks of the Java Programming Gurus</I> would
not be complete if it didn't contain a discussion of the possibilities
for Java's future. A book for Java gurus needs to address more
than just Java itself; it also needs to address the bigger picture
of Java, its relationship to the current shape of the software
industry, and the ways that it challenges the status quo. After
all, Java's future depends in large part on programmers, how programmers
view Java, and what sorts of new applications programmers can
build with it. If programmers use Java to develop slightly improved
versions of the same old programs, Java might still be a real
success, but it will fall short of its true potential.
<P>
This book is full of useful tricks, techniques, and tips, but
all the authors have also tried to include quite a few ideas for
useful Java applets, applications, classes, and class libraries.
Because of its unique combination of features, Java makes it possible
(even easy, in some cases) to write entirely new kinds of applications
that would be impossible (or prohibitively difficult) with more
conventional languages. Ideas and suggestions for such programs
are offered throughout this book.
<P>
This concluding chapter is devoted to the bigger questions:
<UL>
<LI>What is Java really all about?
<LI>Forget details of language features-how is Java fundamentally
different from the languages you've been using?
<LI>How is Java different from all the other flavors of the month
that the software industry has seen in the past decade?
<LI>What kinds of applications will really take advantage of Java's
special strengths?
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>What kinds of changes might Java bring
to the industry? To your customers?</FONT>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="TheJavaIdeals"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>The
Java Ideals</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
Java might be the most-hyped technology ever. Java certainly cannot
live up to all the claims and expectations, but it's impossible
to say how close it might come. Java really isn't a huge technological
leap-from a technical perspective, the only thing about Java that's
really new is the combination of features all in one place. Java
is definitely not the &quot;silver bullet&quot; that will finally
tame the growing complexity of software.
<P>
On the other hand, Java is far more than &quot;just another language.&quot;
It's very unusual to see a technology that stirs such excitement
both at the highest levels of management and in the trenches among
working programmers. Interestingly, a lot of the excitement seems
to stem from something deeper than the language features. As corny
as it might sound, many people, especially programmers, are excited
about Java because of the <I>ideals</I> it seems to represent.
<P>
Java's design, in my opinion, reflects two ideals, and in many
ways the features that have caused all the excitement are the
ones that sprang from those ideals. Accordingly, it's worth taking
a page or two to spell them out. Naturally, I can't speak for
the entire Java community, and I certainly can't speak for Java's
designers, so please take this section as one person's view of
the ideals of Java.
<H3><B>&quot;Open&quot; Should Be More Than a Buzzword</B></H3>
<P>
When companies first became interested in &quot;open systems&quot;
as an alternative to the proprietary computer systems that they
found themselves harnessed to, the very term carried a lot of
power. Systems could be <I>open</I>-documented, compatible, cooperative.
All the interest in open systems has brought some very real benefits,
but the words don't really have the same ring anymore because
they've been used as marketing buzzwords to describe systems that
aren't really very &quot;open&quot; at all.
<P>
Java really is an open system. The language implementation is
available for all to inspect, and the specification is published
so that others can reimplement Java from scratch if they want.
All the system documentation is available on the Web.
<P>
Java is open in other ways, too. It encourages and empowers developers
to write open software systems of their own. The HotJava Web browser
showcases this particular Java ideal: it's an application that
is carefully written so that it can be extended and improved by
anybody, dynamically, over the network.
<P>
The Java library provides examples and support for developers
who want to build open applications. The classes contain special
comments that can be used to generate hypertext documentation
automatically (<A HREF="ch18.htm" >see Chapter 18</A>, &quot;Developing
Database Applications and<BR>
Applets&quot;). Factory objects (<A HREF="ch17.htm" >Chapter 17</A>,
&quot;Network-Extensible Applications with Factory Objects&quot;)
provide a powerful technique for making libraries extensible,
and Java's security features (Part 6, &quot;Security&quot;) enable
extensions to be fetched from the network without fear.
<P>
Another aspect of Java's openness is its commitment to platform
independence. Java now runs on 32-bit Windows systems, Macs, most
UNIX systems, and OS/2, and it will soon run on 16-bit Windows
systems and several less prominent platforms. No implementation
dependencies are allowed by the Java language specification, and
the Java bytecode format is completely portable.
<P>
Finally, Java's openness is reflected in its support for the Unicode
international character set. Even though the current tools don't
completely implement that support, the inclusion of Unicode support
in the language specification and the library interfaces is an
important statement. Future Java tools that do support Unicode
properly will make it easier than ever before to write truly international
applications.
<P>
Java is true to the ideal of open systems.
<H3><B>Code Should Be Reusable (You've Heard That Before&#133;)</B>
</H3>
<P>
People have been talking about reusable software for years, but
programmers are still reinventing the wheel, every minute of every
day. Why should Java be any different?
<H4><B>Java Facilitates Reuse</B></H4>
<P>
Most object-oriented languages have software reusability as a
goal, and Java is no different. But Java has some unusual features
beyond typical object-orientation that facilitate code reuse.
(As usual, the individual features aren't really new, but the
combination is.)
<P>
First among them are Java's platform independence and the portable
bytecode format. A Java class can be compiled once, on one machine,
and then used on any system that supports Java. This capability
reduces the cost of reuse.
<P>
The Java documentation conventions and the javadoc tool also help.
One of the most frequent barriers to reuse is poor documentation:
unless you wrote the class yourself, you don't really know what
it does. Java's support for good class documentation doesn't magically
solve the problem, but the support makes it easier for programmers
to provide useful documentation for their class libraries.
<P>
The combination of language safety and exception handling takes
some of the worry out of code reuse because it limits the damage
that a third-party class can do in your program.
<P>
The final item on the list is the really unusual one. The combination
of Java's security features and built-in networking facilities
can ease many of the inconveniences of reuse. Packaging is a big
obstacle to effective reuse. You don't want to choose (and pay
for) a class library before you understand your needs for your
project. On the other hand, when the need arises, seeking out
a library that has the kind of class you need takes some work,
and then you must purchase the whole library. Later in the project,
you might realize the need for a different kind of class that
isn't a part of the library you bought. Often, just writing a
new version of the class is easier, especially because most existing
commercial class libraries provide fairly simple classes.
<P>
The process would be easier if you could purchase classes individually
or (possibly better yet) pay for them on a per-use basis. Java
permits an application to load individual classes from the network,
thus paving the way for such fine-grained reuse. Additionally,
the suggested convention (detailed in the Java language specification)
for allocating unique class names makes use of the Internet host
naming system, so it might someday be possible to find a class
on the Internet based solely on the full class name. Big problems
still exist, of course, but the possibility is fascinating in
its potential.
<H4><B>You Can Facilitate Reuse, Too</B></H4>
<P>
Even if you don't have plans to make your Java classes available
to others, paying attention to reusability is worthwhile. Try
to write generalized classes that can be useful in a variety of
situations. Provide for extensibility using factory objects and
dynamically loaded classes, where appropriate. Document the class
interface. Put some thought into error handling: try to solve
the problem, if possible, rather than just throw an exception;
when you have to throw an exception, use one that is really appropriate
for the error condition; and make sure that exceptions are declared
as a part of a method's interface.
<H2><A NAME="TheJavaCommunity"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>The
Java Community</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
All programming languages have communities of users. Often they
are very close-knit communities, with user groups that share ideas
and cooperate. Such communities help a language evolve to meet
new challenges or to correct deficiencies. A close-knit language
community can make a strong contribution to the success of a language.
<P>
When a language becomes widely used as quickly as Java has, the
user community is especially important. The language's designers
need feedback to understand the weak points and suggestions for
how to strengthen them. New programmers need help to learn the
ropes. Most importantly, during the initial period when the standard
libraries are being improved and expanded, cooperation is necessary
to converge on a single, versatile solution, rather than a host
of different, weaker alternatives.
<P>
In this respect, Java has the advantage of being strongly tied
to the Internet. For several reasons, most Java developers have
good Internet access. The Net makes it easy for Java users from
all over to find others with similar interests, share experiences,
and cooperate to meet new goals. The Usenet newsgroup devoted
to Java, <TT>comp.lang.java</TT>,
is extremely active (so active that a proposal is under consideration
to split it into eight separate groups, to help manage the traffic).
Mailing lists are devoted to several special topics including
a Java interface to OpenDoc, a MIDI library, a VRML library, and
ports to various different machines and operating systems. JavaSoft
maintains a Web page titled &quot;The Java Developer Community&quot;
that contains pointers to newsgroups, mailing lists, and regional
user groups related to Java.  The URL is <TT><A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/aboutJava/community.html">http://www.javasoft.com/aboutJava/community.html</A></TT>.
Another useful resource is Gamelan's Java projects page, at <TT><A HREF="http://www.gamelan.com/pages/Gamelan.programming.projects.html">http://www.gamelan.com/pages/Gamelan.programming.projects.html</A></TT>.
<P>
If you are using Java in your work, or plan to, it's in your own
interest to help Java succeed. The existence of a large body of
programmers who know the language is important to many companies
who are wary of adopting a language if programmers are difficult
to find. When more companies adopt the language, more opportunities
are created for programmers.
<P>
Java's user community is strong and growing. If Java is important
to your work, try to find the time to participate. Make use of
Java resources on the Internet. When you can't figure out something,
ask the question-someone will probably answer, and good questions
help the community to recognize confusing issues that need to
be addressed. When you learn more, help novices who are following
in your footsteps. Offer your input on the design of new libraries
and facilities that you hope to use.
<P>
Consider making your classes available for others to use, either
freely or for a fee. Especially now, in the early days of Java,
the entire Java community is trying to quickly build a polished
language system, an extensive library, and a mature body of techniques
and expertise from a standing start. A great deal of sharing and
cooperation are going on, and everyone is reaping the benefits.
If possible, give something back. If, in the course of your work,
you develop something (even just an idea or a technique) that
you find useful but that probably isn't the linchpin of your fortune,
think about sharing it with the Java community. You certainly
don't have to give it away for it to be a contribution. If you
have Java classes that you think people will pay to use, try selling
them! You might save people some time and effort, and you'll be
encouraging the growth of a market for reusable Java classes.
Everybody wins.
<P>
There's room for both competition and cooperation in the Java
community.

Your Sights</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
Java opens a lot of doors. No development environment has ever
combined so many good things in one package. Java is
<UL>
<LI>Object-oriented
<LI>Safe
<LI>Robust
<LI>Secure
<LI>Network-enabled
<LI>Graphical
<LI>Multithreaded
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Platform independent</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
Work is in progress to add several other items to that list:
<UL>
<LI>Distributed
<LI>Persistent
<LI>Internationalized
<LI>Multimedia capable
<LI>Realtime capable
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Ubiquitous</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
All these characteristics, used together, amount to far more than
their sum. Nevertheless, revolutionary new Java applications won't
build themselves.
<P>
The really good Java applications will be the ones that take the
best advantage of the things that make Java special-both the details
and features discussed throughout this book and the ideals described
at the start of this chapter. But that description is not really
helpful because it emphasizes the building blocks without providing
a useful picture of the building. It would be better to look at
three of the kinds of applications you could build with those
tools.
<P>
Extensible applications can download extensions dynamically, to
provide new functionality. These applications gain value through
the efforts of third-party developers who provide useful extensions.
Netscape's applet facility represents a simple kind of extensibility,
whereas HotJava's content handlers and protocol handlers show
more of the potential.
<P>
Applet platforms provide an execution environment where applets
can be fetched and run by a user on demand-sort of like the native
operating system but with Java's additional benefits. With flexible
security policies, applets can begin taking the place of some
smaller, infrequently used applications.
<P>
Applications that exploit the network can provide additional functionality,
larger template and media libraries, better documentation, and
easy collaboration among other users of the same application.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, has predicted
(and hoped) that eventually Web browsers will cease to be the
main interface to the Web. He feels that the Web will become a
resource that is used by most programs, the same way that programs
currently use local system resources like files. Web browsers
will still have their place, but they will be used primarily for
viewing information (just as most operating systems today come
with a simple program for viewing text files), and they will be
called upon by other applications to display HTML and other Web
documents as needed. Java is the ideal language for writing those
next-generation Web-aware applications.
<P>
Set your sights high-aim for applications that really exploit
Java's potential. One of the goals of this book has been to provide
pointers toward the new kinds of applications that might arise,
to help developers get the most out of Java. Take these tricks,
build on them, and add more of your own. Java has tremendous promise,
and it's up to application developers to make that promise a reality.
