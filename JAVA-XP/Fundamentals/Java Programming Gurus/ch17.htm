<P>
One of the most important extensibility features of the Java library
is its use of factory objects. <I>Factory objects</I> permit the
actual type of new objects to be determined at runtime, based
on data or circumstances of the moment. Java did not originate
the concept-other languages have factory objects or similar mechanisms.
However, the Java library makes effective use of factories to
make some of the core facilities flexible and extensible. Factory
objects are crucial building blocks for making applications which
can be extended dynamically using code from the network.
<P>
This chapter explains factory objects and how they work. You learn
about the existing factories in the Java library and how to extend
them. Because factories and the kinds of objects they create are
often closely related, you learn about those objects and how to
write new, specialized versions that the factories can use for
special situations. You also learn how to build support for new
factory objects into your own class libraries and applications,
and how to recognize situations where it would be a good idea
to use factories.
<H2><A NAME="HowFactoriesWork"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>How
Factories Work</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
While an application is running, it is constantly creating new
objects of various types in order to accomplish its function.
The number and size of the objects are often determined at runtime-in
response to changing conditions and input data-but the <I>type</I>
of each object is usually fixed when the program is written. When
you write code to allocate a new object with a <TT>new</TT>
operation, you choose a particular type for the object. A <TT>new</TT>
operation does what it's told; it does not allocate whatever subclass
seems most appropriate in a particular situation.
<P>
Sometimes, though, that's exactly what you need. Your program
needs to adapt not only to the size and number of data items it's
asked to deal with; it needs to adapt to the <I>kind</I> of data.
For example, when asked to open a file, a URL, or a mail message,
the program might need to vary its behavior depending on the particular
type of data found in each of those entities. It's no fun to have
to write a big multiway switch to choose what sort of object to
allocate, and it's not a particularly good idea, either. It would
be better if that knowledge were located in one place so that
applications could share it. It would also be good if knowledge
about new types and data formats could be added without having
to rebuild all the applications that need the new support.
<P>
Fortunately, factory objects provide just the mechanism needed
to handle such situations. In some situations, instead of allocating
a particular type of object explicitly with <TT>new</TT>,
you request that another object allocate the object for you. That
other object, the factory object, looks at the current situation
and decides on a specific class of object that fits the bill.
The factory allocates the new object (after loading the class,
if necessary) and returns it to you.
<P>
Of course, each kind of object that the factory can return must
be a valid subtype of the nominal type that the factory object
returns (that is, they must all have a common superclass or implement
a common interface). Somewhere in the code for the factory object,
there probably <I>will</I>  be a large multiway switch that chooses
the appropriate class for each situation. The factory might also
read a configuration file or fetch configuration information from
a URL so that the initial list of classes can be extended without
modifying any of the factory's code. The knowledge and messiness
is encapsulated in one place, however, and the benefits (flexibility
and extensibility) are enjoyed by all the code that uses the factory.
<H3>An Example from the Java Library</H3>
<P>
There are a few other complications, though. To get a clearer
idea of how a factory object really works, let's take a look at
how a factory object is used in a common Java operation: creating
a URL object.
<P>
You start by allocating a URL object pointing to a particular
Web page:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>URL doc = new URL(&quot;http://www.utdallas.edu/~glv/&quot;);</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first thing to notice is that you really <I>do</I> just allocate
the object with a new expression. The application code doesn't
call the factory object directly; usually that's done in a library
class. The URL class actually calls the factory for you. This
helps keep the library interface simple: It's best if application
programmers can always use <TT>new</TT>
to allocate objects, rather than having to remember the cases
where factory objects need to be involved. Keeping the interface
simple also helps promote consistency. If application programmers
have to call the factory object themselves when they need a URL
object, some will surely forget, and their applications won't
have the easy extensibility that most Java applications should.
<P>
The URL constructor takes the URL you give it and parses it into
its various parts: protocol, host, and so on. At that point, there's
little more that it can do. All the processing that is common
to most different kinds of URLs has been done, and the rest depends
on the protocol involved. This is where the factory comes in.
The URL class contains the following instance variable:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>URLStreamHandler handler;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>handler</TT> variable refers
to the object that does most of the real work involved with the
URL, and that's the one that gets allocated by the factory. The
URL constructor initializes it this way:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>if ((handler = getURLStreamHandler(protocol))
== null) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new MalformedURLException(&quot;unknown
protocol: &quot; + protocol);<BR>
}</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>getURLStreamHandler</TT> method
is a static method in the URL class, and it contains the call
to the factory object:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>URLStreamHandler handler;<BR>
if (factory != null) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handler = factory.createURLStreamHandler(protocol);
<BR>
}</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The factory is stored in a class variable, <TT>factory</TT>,
which is set by the application. The factory decides what kind
of handler is needed for the protocol, allocates the appropriate
object, and returns it. What does <TT>getURLStreamHandler</TT>
do if <TT>factory</TT> is <TT>null</TT>?
Here's what happens next:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>// Try java protocol handler<BR>
if (handler == null) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String clname
= &quot;sun.net.www.protocol.&quot; + protocol + &quot;.Handler&quot;;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handler = (URLStreamHandler)
Class.forName(clname).newInstance();<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (Exception e) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<BR>
}</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Notice that <TT>getURLStreamHandler</TT>
does a part of the factory object's job itself. In fact, it implements
a sort of fallback factory: If the application has not supplied
a factory for <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>
objects, or if the factory cannot supply an appropriate object,
this method within the URL class can do a minimal job. It looks
for a library class with a conventional name, and if it finds
one that matches, that class is assumed to be the handler. This
might fail, but it should fail in a reasonable way. If the class
doesn't exist, the <TT>Class.forname(clname)</TT>
call throws an exception. If the class isn't a valid subtype of
<TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>, the cast
will fail.
<P>
The URL class does this because it's intended as a general-purpose
library class. Policies about how to discover and locate protocol
handlers are left to the factory, which is a part of an individual
application, so that the application authors can make the important
decisions about how to configure and extend the application's
capabilities. Probably a few good <TT>URLStreamHandlerFactory</TT>
implementations will appear and will be shared by most applications,
but a full-fledged, configurable factory implementation really
isn't appropriate for the standard Java library. On the other
hand, some minimal level of functionality is essential for the
library, and the <TT>getURLStreamHandler</TT>
fallback code provides it. (The fallback could have been implemented
as a default factory object that could be replaced by the application,
but the security model gets in the way. See the section &quot;Security
Considerations&quot; later in this chapter for more information.)
<P>
There's one other complication that should be mentioned now. Because
the type of handler is entirely dependent on the protocol, the
URL class maintains a cache of handlers for different protocols
and reuses them to avoid having to call the factory for each new
URL. The <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>
class-as well as the interface between the handlers and the URL
class-has been carefully designed so that a single handler <I>instance</I>
can handle multiple URLs simultaneously. Alternative strategies
might have involved calling the <TT>clone</TT>
method (or <TT>getClass().newInstance()</TT>)
on an existing handler of the appropriate type or simply calling
the factory again for a new instance.
<P>
Here's the complete code for the <TT>getURLStreamHandler</TT>
method, so you can see the entire picture:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>/**<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handler

<H2><A NAME="FactorySupportintheJavaLibrary"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Factory
Support in the Java Library</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The example of the <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>
is typical of the support for other types of factories in the
Java library: The support is there to <I>use</I> the factories
if they are supplied by the application, and a simple fallback
is implemented within the library code; but no real factory objects
are supplied. Java supports extensibility wherever it can, but
it leaves specific policies (such as where to search for extensions
and how to find the right one) up to the applications. This section
explains the details of the factory support found in the Java
library and how to implement specialized factories that the library
can use. As you will see, factories and the objects they return
(handlers or implementations) are closely related, so this section
provides insight into how to write both the factories and the
handler objects. Each factory and handler combination works a
little differently.
<P>
The Java library knows about three kinds of factories:
<UL>
<LI><TT>SocketImplFactory</TT>
<LI><TT>URLStreamHandlerFactory</TT>
<LI><TT>ContentHandlerFactory</TT>
</UL>
<H3>The Socket Implementation Factory</H3>
<P>
Socket implementations are used internally to the <TT>Socket</TT>
class to provide the basic socket functionality. In general, instances
of <TT>Socket</TT> and <TT>ServerSocket</TT>
just pass operations on to their internal <TT>SocketImpl</TT>
object, which does all the work. There is only one supplied socket
implementation, <TT>PlainSocketImpl</TT>,
that does conventional socket handling. Additional socket implementations
can be written to handle firewalls and other situations in which
sockets must use a proxy server to access certain machines.
<P>
There are hooks for two separate <TT>SocketImplFactory</TT>
objects: One is in the <TT>Socket</TT>
class (set with the <TT>setSocketImplFactory</TT>
method), and the other is in <TT>ServerSocket</TT>
(set with <TT>setSocketFactory</TT>).
Typically, both factories are instances of the same class, or
even the same object, but they don't have to be. Both <TT>Socket</TT>
and <TT>ServerSocket</TT> call their
factory's <TT>createSocketImpl</TT>
method in their constructors. That method doesn't contain any
parameters, so it doesn't return different types of socket implementation
objects based on the parameters of the socket. It returns the
same kind for every socket, based on application configuration
information. In keeping with this, the fallback code (for the
case where no factory has been created) is also simple: It always
creates a new <TT>PlainSocketImpl</TT>.
<P>
When writing a <TT>SocketImplFactory</TT>
object, you don't need to build a lot of intelligence into the
factory. It is probably best simply to allow users to provide
configuration information that specifies what kind of socket implementation
should be used. You can supply a couple of socket implementations
to handle common cases and provide a configuration dialog or some
other mechanism for selecting one of those. Because all users
within a particular site will probably require the same configuration,
this also is a good case for permitting site administrators to
supply a global configuration. That way, individual users don't
have to be bothered with knowing what kind of firewall they have,
and you don't have to be bothered with configuring your application
on an individual basis. Finally, don't restrict users to just
the socket implementations you supply. Allow them to specify an
arbitrary class. That way, sites with unusual firewall policies
(or vendors of new firewall software) will be able to write their
own <TT>SocketImpl</TT> classes, and
they won't be excluded from using your application.
<H3>The URL Stream Handler Factory</H3>
<P>
The first part of a URL, up to the colon, is called the URL's
<I>scheme</I> or <I>protocol</I>. Common URL protocols include
HTTP, FTP, and news. Each protocol is implemented by a subclass
of <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>. The
URL class chooses which handler to use for each URL by calling
the URL stream handler factory.
<P>
There is a close relationship between URL stream handlers and
several other classes. Internally, a URL stream handler uses a
specialized version of the <TT>URLConnection</TT>
class, usually implemented to accompany a particular implementation
of <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>. The
<TT>URLConnection</TT> class, in turn,
contains the third factory object supported by the library: the
content handler factory. <TT>URLConnection</TT>
objects are responsible for determining the type of the URL's
data and passing that content type to the content handler factory.
<P>
The division of responsibility between all these classes seems
complicated at first, but it is really quite easy to grasp. The
URL object provides a handle and an abstract representation of
the URL so that an application doesn't have to keep track of all
of the various pieces all the time. Internally, it uses a subclass
of <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT> to hold
the protocol-specific information about the URL. The stream handler
knows how to parse the rest of the URL-many URL schemes use the
same syntax for the part after the colon, but some have specialized
syntaxes, and the stream handler is responsible for understanding
that part of the URL syntax. Beyond the URL syntax, however, the
URL stream handler doesn't actually know much. It knows about
a companion class (a subclass of <TT>URLConnection</TT>),
which is responsible for implementing the protocol. The associated
<TT>URLConnection</TT> object knows
how to open a connection based on the URL information, handle
the actual protocol operations to retrieve or deliver a document
(or several), and close the connection.
<P>
After that is done, the <TT>URLConnection</TT>
object has gained access to two things: the document of interest
and some information <I>about</I> that document. After learning
what <I>kind</I> of document it has (the media type), the <TT>URLConnection</TT>
can either provide an I/O stream to the raw document data or create
a <TT>ContentHandler</TT> object to
convert the document into an object representation.
<P>
This seems complicated, but there are a lot of separate issues
to deal with, and the Java library designers were right not to
get them confused. Each separate concept is represented by one
class or family of classes:<BR>

<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=60%>
<TR><TD WIDTH=50%>Basic URL abstraction</TD><TD WIDTH=50%><TT>URL</TT>
</TD></TR>

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD WIDTH=50%>Data format handling</TD><TD WIDTH=50%><TT>ContentHandler</TT>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The first of these four concepts is independent of protocol or
data format, and so it is represented by one class. The second
and third are both tied to particular protocols, so appropriate
classes are chosen by a factory object (the factory chooses the
<TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>, which chooses
the matching <TT>URLConnection</TT>).
The last is tied to specific data formats, but is independent
of protocol, so classes to fit data formats are chosen by a different
factory object.
<P>
What this means for writers of specialized <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>
subclasses is that, in general, each <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>
needs to have a companion <TT>URLConnection</TT>
class. For example, Sun's classes, which are used to implement
the applet viewer, include the following two classes:
<UL>
<LI><TT>sun.net.www.protocol.http.Handler</TT>
<LI><TT>sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection</TT>
</UL>
<P>
Make sure your stream handler and connection classes maintain
the correct division of responsibility. The stream handler should
understand the URL syntax and choose the connection class, with
the mechanics of the protocol being left to the connection class.
<P>
Besides the workings of the protocol, the connection class has
one other important responsibility: calling the content handler
factory when necessary. To do that, the connection object must
first determine the type of the document being retrieved. That's
a protocol-specific matter, but some protocols, such as FTP, don't
really provide that information, so the connection object must
guess. Fortunately, the abstract <TT>URLConnection</TT>
class provides two utility methods that can be useful for guessing
a file's type from its name or content. The <TT>guessContentTypeFromName</TT>
method takes the file's name as a parameter and attempts to intuit
the type from the file's extension using a built-in table. Given
a file with the extension &quot;jpg,&quot; for example, it would
assume that the file was a JPEG image file. The other method,
<TT>guessContentTypeFromStream</TT>,
takes the data input stream as a parameter and inspects the first
few bytes for characteristic patterns that identify different
file types.
<P>
All this might be useful information for writing URL stream handlers
and connection classes, but what about the factory object itself?
That might be one of the easiest parts. You certainly want to
give it built-in knowledge of the stream handlers you supply with
your application and the URL scheme identifiers that match them.
Permitting users to configure the factory and add new handlers
is also a good idea. Finally, it might be a good idea to write
your <TT>URLStreamHandlerFactory</TT>
to consult a network-based registry and load stream handlers from
the network under certain conditions. Most of these issues aren't
peculiar to URL stream handlers and are discussed in the section
&quot;Factory Object Implementation Considerations,&quot; later
in this chapter.
<P>
Once you have written your factory, install it in the URL class
using the <TT>URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory</TT>
method.
<H3>The Content Handler Factory</H3>
<P>
Content handlers are associated with URL connections, and they
are responsible for interpreting different data formats. Data
formats are identified by MIME media type names. Common formats
include the following:<BR>

</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
A content handler must be able to understand its format and generate
an appropriate Java object representing that format. For example,
a content handler designed for image/gif might build an instance
of the <TT>java.awt.image</TT> class.
<TT>ContentHandler</TT> is an abstract
class, with one method: <TT>getContent</TT>.
With a <TT>URLConnection</TT> object
as a parameter, the method reads the data from the connection,
builds the appropriate object representation, and returns it.
When writing a content handler, it might be helpful to read Chapter
5, &quot;Building Special-Purpose I/O Classes.&quot; It contains
a discussion about building classes that provide an object representation
of structured data.
<P>
The content handler factory is found within the <TT>URLConnection</TT>
class and can be set using the <TT>URLConnection.setContentHandlerFactory</TT>
method. <TT>URLConnection</TT> has
its own <TT>getContent</TT> method,
just like <TT>ContentHandler</TT>.
When <TT>URLConnection.getContent()</TT>
is called, the <TT>URLConnection</TT>
object queries the content handler factory for the right handler
and calls the handler's <TT>getContent</TT>
method, with <TT>this</TT> as the
parameter. In case there is not a content handler factory, the
fallback code looks for a built-in handler class using the content
type. For example, if the content type is <TT>text/html</TT>,
the default <TT>URLConnection</TT>
implementation looks for the class <TT>sun.net.www.content.text.html</TT>.
If it doesn't find a class with that name, it will simply return
<TT>null</TT>. The JDK doesn't come
with such a class, but the HotJava application does, and any application
is free to provide content handler classes of its own. 
<H2><A NAME="FactoryObjectImplementationConsiderat"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Factory
Object Implementation Considerations</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Unlike the handler or implementation objects that they generate,
factory objects have a lot in common. They may be very simple,
like <TT>SocketImplFactory</TT>, or
more complex, like <TT>ContentHandlerFactory</TT>,
but they are all essentially the same: Based on the current data
or circumstances, factory objects figure out which specialized
type of object is best equipped to deal with the situation. Factories
either have a built-in knowledge of the alternatives or know where
to go to find out about them. The only difficult issues involved
in writing a factory object are the strategies used to discover
the right answer and how much trouble the factory goes to before
it gives up.
<P>
The simplest strategy for building a factory object is to hard-code
knowledge of several classes into the factory. At runtime, a simple
table lookup will suffice to determine whether the situation is
one that the application understands. If it is, the factory can
allocate and return an instance of the appropriate class. Only
slightly more complex is the strategy used by the built-in fallback
code in the Java library: searching for a class with a conventional
name via the <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>. The
first approach might suffice in some very simple situations, but
if there is no possibility of extending or configuring the factory's
knowledge, it's hardly worth having a factory at all. The second
approach at least enables users and site administrators to configure
and extend the system in useful ways. It's still a very limited
approach, however, because it requires all the handlers to be
in the same package.
<P>
Another approach, which is easier and more flexible for users,
is to provide a configuration file-or better yet a configuration
dialog-so that new handlers or implementations can be used without
having to be placed in the same package as the built-in handlers.
They still have to conform to the appropriate Java type rules
and so on, so this won't violate any language assumptions. It
just makes things flexible for the people using the application.
<P>
The problem with all of those approaches is that they assume that
the users or site administrators will be looking for new handlers,
fetching them, and taking the trouble to install them correctly.
It would be much better to take advantage of Java's networking
and security capabilities to do all that work within the factory
object. One way of doing that would be to rely on a central online
registry that could be queried over the network, returning a URL
which could be used to retrieve the appropriate class. Your company
could maintain such a registry, collecting information about appropriate
handlers as they became available. In the case of handlers written
by you or others in your organization, your customers can access
the extra functionality immediately, without having to install
any additional software. If users or other vendors write handlers
to support formats or protocols that they are interested in, you
can make sure that other users also get the advantage of those
classes. You and your users can save a lot of trouble and expense.
<P>
I anticipate that public, general-use registries will appear for
classes such as <TT>URLStreamHandler</TT>
and <TT>ContentHandler</TT>. Your
applications can simply make use of those, and you will need only
to maintain registries for classes that are tied closely to your
own application.
<P>
There's one more approach to finding applicable classes. It's
a little trickier than the others, but it can yield huge benefits
in flexibility and usefulness. If your application is one that
works with data from the network (as Web browsers do, for example),
you can allow data providers to supply handlers themselves. You
simply need to document where to put classes in relation to the
data and how to name them, and then look for them according to
those rules when other strategies fail.
<P>
Two examples might help to illustrate this idea. First, imagine
an application fetching a document via an HTTP URL and finding
that it has content type <TT>image/spiffy</TT>.
After trying other strategies to find a handler, the content handler
factory might return to the site from which the unrecognized document
was fetched to try to find a handler there. It might look for
a class called <TT>ContentHandler_image_spiffy</TT>,
first in the same directory where the document was found, and
then perhaps in another directory at that site with a conventional
name-perhaps <TT>classes/content_handlers</TT>.
<P>
As a second example, imagine a Web browser that has just fetched
an HTML document from <TT>www.foo.com</TT>.
One section of that HTML document contains the following link:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>&lt;a href=&quot;mirror://www.bar.com/foomobile.gif&quot;&gt;A
terrific <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;picture of a Foomobile!&lt;/a&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It sounds good, but what about this &quot;<TT>mirror</TT>&quot;
protocol? As humans, we might guess from the name that it's a
new protocol designed to enable a document to be mirrored at several
places around the Internet, but that doesn't help the program
to know what to do with it (and we might be wrong, in any case).
The URL stream handler factory could pursue a strategy similar
to the one in the previous example to find a handler for the <TT>mirror</TT>
protocol, looking first in the same directory where the document
containing the link was found and then in a special directory
at the same site.
<P>
If you write a factory object that fetches new classes from the
network, it's important to bear two things in mind. It is helpful
to cache those downloaded classes locally so that they don't have
to be fetched anew for each use. You can then treat the cache
as a private, local registry of the type described previously.
The other thing to remember is that, for such features to be useful
to your users and the people who provide useful data on the network,
they have to be well- documented and reasonably well-known.
<P>
There are also security considerations involved when writing factory
objects and handlers, no matter what strategy you implement for
finding applicable handlers. They are addressed in the section
&quot;Security Considerations,&quot; later in this chapter.
<H2><A NAME="SupportingaNewKindofFactory"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Supporting
a New Kind of Factory</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The classes that use factory objects are, in some ways, more interesting
and important than factory objects themselves. The Java library
includes four such classes (<TT>Socket</TT>,
<TT>ServerSocket</TT>, <TT>URL</TT>,
and <TT>URLConnection</TT>), but that
doesn't mean you won't find a reason to build another, whether
you are building a complete application or a reusable library.
How do you know when a new kind of factory is what you want-and
how do you add the support for it?
<H3>When Are Factories Useful?</H3>
<P>
In general, you need a factory object when you want to provide
an <I>implementation abstraction</I>: an abstract interface to
some functionality that hides the details of shifting implementations
that might be required.
<P>
More specifically, you should use a factory object when three
conditions apply:
<UL>
<LI>You want to provide a uniform, high-level interface to a concept,
which can have multiple underlying implementations.
<LI>The choice of a particular implementation depends on data,
environment, or other runtime circumstances.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You cannot know in advance the entire
set of implementations and the circumstances that might call for
them.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
There are many concepts that might be good candidates for implementation
abstractions. Here are just a few examples:
<UL>
<LI>Data types in a spreadsheet or database
<LI>Specialized notations (for example, mathematical equations
or chemical diagrams) in a technical word processor
<LI>Alert handlers in a network management system
<LI>Graphical user interface widgets, such as the elements used
to provide fill-out forms in HTML documents
<LI>Special-effect &quot;plug-ins&quot; in an image processing
program
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Reusable tool components, such as spelling
checkers, searching engines, printer drivers, and toolbars</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
There are probably many other situations that could be added.
<P>
Each of the three kinds of factory objects supported by the Java
library meets these three conditions. There are high-level classes
that let application code ignore the details of multiple underlying
implementations. The choice of implementation depends on the runtime
situation-either data (in the case of URL stream handlers and
content handlers) or environment (in the case of socket implementations).
There is no way to predict what new kinds of protocols, data types,
and firewall proxy interfaces might be developed.
<H3>Tips for Building Implementation Abstractions</H3>
<P>
There are a few rules of thumb you should follow when building
implementation abstractions and the factory objects and handlers
that make them work:
<UL>
<LI>Hide the use of the factory in a library class
<LI>Don't try to force the handlers to be completely uniform
<LI>Supply an example factory, but put fallback code in the library
class, in case there's no factory at all
<LI>Keep a cache of handlers
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Remember security issues</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
Make sure that the application-level class (the class that provides
the implementation abstraction itself) takes care of the factory
behind the scenes. Don't leave it to the application to call the
factory when necessary-make the abstraction cleaner by hiding
that detail.
<P>
On the other hand, don't take the abstraction too far. Sometimes
it's not possible to hide every detail. In the Java library, socket
implementations represent one extreme where the abstraction is
nearly perfect, and the application using the code doesn't really
have to know anything about underlying mechanisms. URL stream
handlers also can hide nearly every detail. Content handlers,
however, can hide things only up to a point. Then, they must return
an object that provides a runtime representation of the document
they were asked to interpret. That object might be a <TT>String</TT>
containing a plain text document, an <TT>Image</TT>,
an <TT>AudioClip</TT>, or an instance
of a class that can format and display a structured document (such
as an HTML). The application must know what to do with those objects,
and a new content handler might return a type of object that the
application can't handle. In spite of those complications, it's
still a worthwhile abstraction and hides a lot of messy details.
<P>
(Perhaps you think that, with a little care, the content handler
abstraction could have been more thorough, to the point of providing
a unified interface to data objects so that an application could
handle them all in a uniform way. If so, that's terrific! I can't
wait to see the result.)
<P>
If you have a fairly good idea of how to go about finding the
appropriate handler class for the situation, go ahead and supply
a sample implementation of the factory so that applications can
use it if possible. Follow the example of the Java library implementors,
however, and provide some fallback behavior in the primary class,
which is used if no factory is installed. It can be very simple,
but it helps to make your classes robust. It will work for the
most common cases in the event that the application writers forget
to install a factory, or in circumstances where the factory cannot
do its job.
<P>
Keep a cache of handlers. If you're loading handlers from the
network, this is vitally important, but it's useful even if all
the handlers are available locally. If you implement your abstraction
so that the same handler <I>instance</I> can handle multiple cases
of the abstraction, you can cache not only the handler classes,
but the handler instances themselves. The Java library does this
for URL stream handlers and content handlers. Given the simple
fallback strategy that the library classes use in the absence
of real factory objects, the efficiency benefits of the approach
might not be obvious to you at first, but a real factory object
might have to do a lot of work to find the right handler, including
several disk and network accesses. A simple cache of previously
used handler instances can avoid all that work in most cases.
Implementing the cache in the abstraction class also means that
it only has to be done once, and all factory object implementations
gain the benefit automatically. The source code for the <TT>URL.getURLStreamHandler</TT>
method listed near the beginning of this chapter is a good example
of how to implement a simple and effective handler cache.
<P>
Most importantly, pay attention to the security issues surrounding
your factory. There are security implications even if you only
load handlers from trusted sources.
<H2><A NAME="SecurityConsiderations"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Security
Considerations</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
When writing a factory object or an implementation abstraction
that uses a factory, you need to be aware of the security implications.
<P>
First, you need to protect the factory itself. If untrusted code
(possibly an applet in an unrelated part of an application) can
install an untrusted class as a factory object, it can garble
data, transparently substitute data from a completely different
source, or even steal outgoing data. The user of the application
will never be the wiser. The way you protect against this is by
consulting the application security manager when installing a
factory object. The primary object of your implementation abstraction
will probably provide a method for installing a factory, much
as the URL class provides <TT>setURLStreamHandlerFactory</TT>.
To protect against sabotage, that method includes this code:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>if (factory != null) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new Error(&quot;factory already
defined&quot;);<BR>
}<BR>
SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();<BR>
if (security != null) {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;security.checkSetFactory();<BR>
}</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first part provides a little additional security by permitting
the factory to be set only once. You may choose to forgo that
precaution, but you really should only need one factory object
anyway (at least after you've finished debugging the factory).
 The second part is the important part. If a security manager
is installed, the call to <TT>security.checkSetFactory</TT>
gives the security manager the chance to see whether the new factory
object is being supplied by trusted code. If not, the security
manager will throw a <TT>SecurityException</TT>,
and the next line of code (which actually installs the factory
object) will never be reached.
<P>
Additionally, you need to ensure that the factory cannot be set
directly, bypassing the method that performs the security checks.
The variable that holds the factory object and the method used
to set it should be static so that there is only one factory and
so that the method cannot be overridden in a subclass. The variable
should also be private so that a subclass cannot access it directly.
Depending on the circumstances, you may also wish to make the
class final so that there can be no subclasses (that will not
always be practical, however).
<P>
If the abstraction you are providing is a means for accessing
resources that could be abused by malicious code, you need to
ensure that those resources are protected. You have a choice:
Should the security checks be done in the high-level class or
in the handlers?
<P>
One thing to consider is that you might, at some point, be loading
handlers from untrustworthy sources. It's actually rather unlikely
in this case, because code that provides access to security-sensitive
resources usually requires using native methods, which you shouldn't
be loading from the network. Even if all your handlers will be
trusted, it's still a good idea to put the security checks in
the high-level class. Security issues are complicated, and it's
best to think the issues through once, carefully, and build the
necessary checks in from the start. Otherwise, it would be too
easy for a new handler to open a security hole accidentally because
the programmer forgot an important security check. If every programmer
writing a handler has to think about all those issues, such a
security hole is actually pretty likely. If security is dealt
with once, from the start, in the high-level class, the handlers
don't have to worry about it, and the chance of an accidental
security hole is much smaller.
<P>
Even if you build all the necessary security checks into the high-level
class, there's still one security issue that the handlers need
to deal with: Untrusted code might be able to bypass the class
with the security checks and go straight to the handler. To avoid
this, you need to use the Java language protection mechanisms.
For example, consider the <TT>Socket</TT>
and <TT>SocketImpl</TT> classes. Sockets
need to be protected from abuse, so the <TT>Socket</TT>
class makes several calls to the security manager to ensure that
operations are permitted. <I>All </I>the real functionality of
sockets is handled by some subclass of <TT>SocketImpl</TT>;
however, if untrusted code could create an instance of an appropriate
subclass of <TT>SocketImpl</TT>, no
security checks would be made. The Java library designers avoid
this danger by not making the handler class they supply, <TT>PlainSocketImpl</TT>,
a public class. The class can be used only by other classes within
the same java.net package. Combined with a security policy which
prohibits untrusted code from defining new classes in that package,
the socket abstraction is secure. Everyone who needs to build
a new <TT>SocketImpl</TT> class must
be careful not to make it a public class and to put it into a
package that is protected by the application security manager.
<P>
The final security issue that must be addressed by factory objects
is the most obvious: what to do about handlers that cannot be
trusted. Fortunately, there aren't many decisions to make about
that, at least from the point of view of the author of the factory
object. The security manager and the Java library automatically
restrict the untrusted handler from most of the dangerous things
it could do. The only real issue to consider is whether a handler
found at one site should be allowed to deal with data fetched
from another site. The handler may have been planted by one company
on its own site so that it could intercept data fetched from a
competitor's site, altering it or substituting other data to deceive
the user.
<P>
That scenario seems a little farfetched, I know, but it could
happen. For now, the best policy is to keep track of which site
handlers come from, and reuse them only on data from the same
site. When there are common, shared registries for certain types
of handler classes, there should be some way to determine that
handlers don't do anything underhanded before they are listed
in the registry. Then at least the handlers found through the
registry can be given enough trust to handle data from any site.
No such guarantees exist today.

</H2>
<P>
Factory objects represent a useful technique for making a Java
class library flexible and extensible. Unlike the <TT>new</TT>
operation (which must be told an exact class to instantiate at
compile time), a factory object creates a new object of some general-purpose
class but chooses the specific subclass based on current data
or runtime environment.
<P>
The Java library uses factories to create URL protocol handlers,
content handlers for URL connections, and socket implementation
objects. These factories make it easy to adapt the library to
support new protocols, content types, and socket behavior (such
as socket proxy support).
<P>
Your own class libraries and applications can also use factory
objects to their advantage. Factories are especially useful for
building applications that can be dynamically extended with code
loaded from the network.
