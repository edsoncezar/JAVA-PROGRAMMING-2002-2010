<P>Now let&#146;s have a look at what&#146;s new in Java 1.2.
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>Security Enhancements</B> Now when code is loaded, it is assigned permissions based on the security policy currently in effect. Each permission specifies a permitted access to a particular resource (such as "read" and "write" access to a specified file or directory, "connect" access to a given host and port, and so on). The policy, specifying which permissions are available for code from various signers/locations, can be initialized from an external configurable policy file. Unless a permission is explicitly granted to code, it cannot access the resource that is guarded by that permission.
<DD><B>Swing (JFC)</B> Swing is the part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that implements a new set of GUI components with a "pluggable" look and feel. Swing is implemented in pure Java, and is based on the JDK 1.1 Light-weight UI Framework. The pluggable look and feel lets you design a single set of GUI components that can automatically have the look and feel of any platform (e.g., Windows, Solaris, Macintosh).
<DD><B>Java 2D (JFC)</B> The Java 2D API is a set of classes for advanced 2D graphics and imaging. It encompasses line art, text, and images in a single comprehensive model.
<DD><B>Accessibility (JFC)</B> Through the Java Accessibility API, developers will be able to create Java applications that can interact with assistive technologies such as screen readers, speech recognition systems, and Braille terminals.
<DD><B>Drag and Drop (JFC)</B> Drag and Drop enables data transfer across both Java and native applications, between Java applications, and within a single Java application.
<DD><B>Collections</B> The Java Collections API is a unified framework for representing and manipulating Java collections (I&#146;ll show you more about them later), allowing them to be manipulated independent of the details of their representation.
<DD><B>Java Extensions</B> Framework Extensions are packages of Java classes (and any associated native code) that application developers can use to extend the core platform. The extension mechanism allows the Java virtual machine (VM) to use the extension classes in much the same way it uses the system classes.
<DD><B>JavaBeans Enhancements</B> Java 1.2 provides developers with standard means to create more sophisticated JavaBeans components and applications that offer their customers more seamless integration with the rest of their runtime environment, such as the desktop of the underlying operating system or the browser.
<DD><B>Input Method Framework</B> The input method framework enables all text editing components to receive Japanese, Chinese, or Korean text input through standard input methods.
<DD><B>Package Version Identification</B> "Versioning" introduces package level version control where applications and applets can identify (at runtime) the version of a specific Java Runtime Environment, VM, and class package.
<DD><B>RMI Enhancements</B> Remote Method Invocation (RMI) has several new enhancements including Remote Object Activation, which introduces support for remote objects and automatic object activation, as well as Custom Socket Types that allow a remote object to specify the custom socket type that RMI will use for remote calls to that object. (RMI over a secure transport (such as SSL) can be supported using custom socket types.)
<DD><B>Serialization Enhancements</B> Serialization now includes an API that allows the serialized data of an object to be specified independently of the fields of the class. This allows serialized data fields to be written to and read from the stream using the existing techniques (this ensures compatibility with the default writing and reading mechanisms).
<DD><B>Reference Objects</B> A reference object encapsulates a reference to some other object so that the reference itself may be examined and manipulated like any other object. Reference objects allow a program to maintain a reference to an object that does not prevent the object from being reclaimed by the Java "garbage collector," which manages memory.
<DD><B>Audio Enhancements</B> Audio enhancements include a new sound engine and support for audio in applications as well as applets.
<DD><B>Java IDL</B> Java IDL adds CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) capability to Java, providing standards-based interoperability and connectivity. Java IDL enables distributed Web-enabled Java applications to invoke operations transparently on remote network services using the industry standard OMG IDL (Object Management Group Interface Definition Language) and IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) defined by the Object Management Group.
<DD><B>JAR Enhancements</B> The enhancements include added functionality for the command-line JAR tool for creating and updating signed JAR files. There are also new standard APIs for reading and writing JAR files.
<DD><B>JNI Enhancements</B> The Java Native Interface is a standard programming interface for writing Java native methods and embedding the Java virtual machine into native applications. The primary goal is binary compatibility of native method libraries across all Java virtual machine implementations on a given platform. Java 1.2 extends the Java Native Interface (JNI) to incorporate new features in the Java platform.
<DD><B>JVMDI</B> A New Debugger Interface, the Java Virtual Machine, now provides low level services for debugging. The interface for these services is the Java Virtual Machine Debugger Interface (JVMDI).
<DD><B>JDBC Enhancements</B> Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a standard SQL database access interface, providing uniform access to a wide range of relational databases. JDBC also provides a common base on which higher level tools and interfaces can be built. The Java 1.2 software bundle includes JDBC and the JDBC-ODBC bridge.

<P>These concepts will become clearer as we proceed. Now, you&#146;re ready to compile the hello applet and see it at work.
