<P><BIG><BIG>W</BIG></BIG>elcome to Java 1.2! An ambitious agenda lies before you: You&#146;re going to get a firm grip on Java programming, creating both powerful Java programs and Web pages, and you will take a guided tour through Java 1.2. There is no more exciting programming package available. As you are probably aware, the popularity of Java has skyrocketed as more and more people have seen how versatile and powerful it is. Web programmers have found it an excellent tool because it allows them to write programs that will run on many different types of computers. They have started using it to make their Web pages actually <I>do</I> something.</P>
<P>With Java, you will be able to display animation and images, accept mouse clicks and text, use controls like scrollbars and check boxes, print graphics, support popup menus, and even support additional windows and menu bars.</P>
<P>Each of the skills in this book is specially set up to cover a Java skill, and you&#146;ll see plenty of bite-sized examples as you learn how to handle Java in depth. Other books might have only a few examples, partial examples, or examples that are too long to deal with comfortably; this book&#146;s examples will be plentiful and small enough to target a single skill.</P>
<P>You&#146;ll start working on your Java skills right away&#151;no chapters full of abstractions to wade through first. We will concentrate on examples, on seeing things from the programmer&#146;s point of view&#151;on seeing Java at <I>work</I>.</P>
<P>Java programs come two ways: as stand-alone applications and as small programs you can embed in Web pages, called <I>applets</I>. Of the two, applets are the most popular, and we&#146;ll concentrate primarily on them.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading2"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Building the Hello Example</FONT></H3>
<P>The first example will be a simple one because right now we just want to get you started in Java without too many extra details to weigh you down. You will create a small Java applet, the type of Java program you can embed in a Web page, that will display the words, "Hello from Java!"
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What&#146;s an Applet?</FONT></H4>
<P>Just what do I mean by an applet? An applet is a special program that you can embed in a Web page such that the applet gains control over a certain part of the Web page. On that part of the page, the applet can display buttons, list boxes, images, and more. Applets make Web pages "come alive."
</P>
<P>Each applet is given the amount of space (usually measured in pixels) that it requests in a Web page, such as the amount of space shown in Figure 1.1. (Soon I&#146;ll show you how an applet "requests" space.) This is the space that the applet will use for its display. We&#146;ll place the words "Hello from Java!" in the applet, as shown in Figure 1.2.</P>
<P><A NAME="Fig1"></A><A HREF="images\01-01.jpg"><IMG SRC="images\01-01t.jpg"></A>
<BR><A HREF="images\01-01.jpg"><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>FIGURE 1.1</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;An applet requests space in a Web page.</P>
<P><A NAME="Fig2"></A><A HREF="images\01-02.jpg"><IMG SRC="images\01-02t.jpg"></A>
<BR><A HREF="images\01-02.jpg"><FONT COLOR="#000077"><B>FIGURE 1.2</B></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello from Java!</P>
<P>That&#146;s how this applet will work; after you create it, you will be able to embed it in a Web page. Let&#146;s create and run the applet now.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Creating the Hello Example</FONT></H4>
<P>Let&#146;s call this first applet <I>hello</I>. You will store the actual Java code (the lines of text that make up the program) for this applet in the file <TT>hello.java</TT>. You&#146;ll need an editor of some kind to create this file (such as Windows Wordpad or notepad). You will be creating <TT>.java</TT> files throughout the book, so use an editor you are comfortable with. Also notice that, if you are going to use a word processor like Microsoft Word, you&#146;ll have to save your <TT>.java</TT> files as straight text&#151;something you can type out at the DOS prompt and read directly. Check your word processor&#146;s Save As menu item or your word processor&#146;s documentation to see how to do this. The Sun Java system won&#146;t be able to handle anything but straight text files. Now, type the following text into the file <TT>hello.java</TT> (this is the traditional first program in most java books):</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;
   public class hello extends java.applet.Applet
   &#123;
       public void paint(Graphics g)
       &#123;
           g.drawString("Hello from Java!", 60, 30 );
       &#125;
   &#125;
</PRE>
<P>This is the text of your first Java program, and soon you&#146;ll see what each line means. Having typed in the text, save it to disk as <TT>hello.java</TT>.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Note that case counts here&#151;make sure you type <TT>hello.java</TT>, not <TT>Hello.java </TT>or<TT> hello.Java</TT>.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In general, the name of the file will match exactly (including case) the name given in the "class" statement in the file; in this case, that is <TT>hello</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;

  &#8594;public class hello extends java.applet.Applet
   &#123;
       public void paint( Graphics g )
       &#123;
           g.drawString("Hello from Java!", 60, 30 );
       &#125;
   &#125;
</PRE>
<P>In this book, you will place your programs into subdirectories of a new directory called <TT>java1-2</TT> (this is optional&#151;you can choose any name). That means you&#146;ll save the <TT>hello.java</TT> file as <TT>c:\java1-2\hello\hello.java</TT>.</P>
<P>Now you have created <TT>hello.java</TT>. This is the source code for your applet, and it contains the Java code that you have written.<TT> </TT>The next step is to compile this Java code into a working applet and see your applet at work. Applets have the extension <TT>.class</TT>, making the name of your actual applet <TT>hello.class</TT>. I&#146;ll show you <I>why</I> applets have the extension <TT>.class</TT> shortly.</P><P><BR></P>
