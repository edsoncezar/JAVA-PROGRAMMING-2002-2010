<P>Now that you have installed the JDK and have your <TT>hello.java</TT> file ready to go, you can create the actual applet and see it run. To do this, move to the <TT>c:\java1-2\hello</TT> directory now (or wherever you have placed <TT>hello.java</TT>); this is how the DOS prompt should look:</P>
<PRE>
   c:\java1-2\hello&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Next, type this to create your applet:
</P>
<PRE>
   c:\java1-2\hello&gt;javac hello.java
</PRE>
<P>The name of the Java program that takes your Java code and turns it into <TT>.class</TT> files ready to run in Web pages is called <TT>javac.exe</TT>, the Java <I>compiler</I> (i.e., it compiles <TT>.java</TT> files into <TT>.class</TT> files ). If you type the DOS command <TT>Dir</TT> to look at the current directory contents, you should see both <TT>hello.jav</TT>a and <TT>hello.class</TT>. Because you&#146;ve created <TT>hello.class</TT>, your applet is ready to go&#151;but what does that mean? What have you really done?</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading8"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Understanding Java</FONT></H3>
<P>Let&#146;s take the time now to get an overview of Java. As in most programming languages, we write Java code using words and numbers that are then translated&#151;that is, <I>compiled</I>&#151;into binary files that computers can understand. The <TT>hello.java</TT> program is an example of this&#151;you write it such that you can understand it, but when you want to actually run your program, you have to compile it into something a computer can use. In this case, that means using the Java <I>compiler</I> to produce the file named <TT>hello.class</TT>.<TT> hello.class</TT> is a binary file of <I>bytecodes</I> that Java-compatible Web browsers can run to produce the desired result. In this way, several lines of Java program code can be compiled neatly into a few bytes. Those bytes are what is actually downloaded when Web browsers read the Web page in which you have placed your Java applets&#151;that is to say, the actual applet is a <TT>.class</TT> file, like <TT>hello.class</TT>, and those are the files you place on your Internet Service Provider&#146;s server so other people&#146;s Web browsers can download them, as you&#146;ll see very shortly.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Later, I&#146;ll show you how to use <TT>.jar</TT> files&#151;Java Archive files&#151;to zip up .<TT>class</TT> files even smaller, packing many of them into a single downloadable file.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Experienced programmers may wonder about these bytecodes&#151;why isn&#146;t Java simply compiled into the normal machine code that each computer really runs? Because Java bytecodes were intentionally made machine-independent so that they could be run on a wide variety of machines, and that is what originally made them so popular on the Internet&#151;it doesn&#146;t matter what type of machine you&#146;re downloading to, as long as the user&#146;s Web browser can run Java. The downloaded bytecodes are run by the <I>Java Virtual Machine</I>, or JVM, and it is the JVM&#146;s task to convert bytecodes into the machine language that users&#146; individual computers can run.</P>
<P>The JVM is actually a hypothetical chip that runs Java&#151;it is almost always software, not hardware, that runs Java. Each Web browser that supports Java has a JVM built right into it, and it loads the <TT>.class</TT> file that makes up your applet with JVM&#146;s <I>class loader</I> and then runs the applet.</P>

<P>To see <TT>hello.class</TT>, your first applet, running, you&#146;ll need a Web page to place it in. Use your editor again to create a new file, <TT>hello.htm</TT>, which will be your Web page, written in the language of Web pages, <I>HyperText Markup Language</I> (HTML). Enter the following text into <TT>hello.htm</TT> and save it (we&#146;ll review HTML in a minute):</P>
<PRE>
   &lt;html&gt;

   &lt;!&#151; Web page written for the Sun Applet Viewer&gt;

   &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;hello&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;

   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;hr&gt;

   &lt;applet
   code=hello.class
   width=200
   height=200&gt;

   &lt;/applet&gt;

   &lt;hr&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;
</PRE>
<P>Now you can run the hello applet by simply viewing this new Web page, <TT>hello.htm</TT>. To do that, use the Applet Viewer that comes with the JDK 1.1. To use the Applet Viewer, go back to the <TT>hello</TT> subdirectory and type the following:</P>
<PRE>
   c:\java1-2\hello&gt;appletviewer hello.htm
</PRE>
<P>Again, capitalization is very important here&#151;make sure your capitalization matches the exact spelling of the Web page name. When you&#146;ve done this, the Applet Viewer runs, as shown below&#151;and you see your message, "Hello from Java!" Your first applet is a success.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>You can use any Java-enabled Web browser to look at this Web page. For most of the applets in this book, however, you will have to use either a Web browser that supports Java 1.2 (not just Java 1.0 or Java 1.1) or the Sun Applet Viewer.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Your first applet, <TT>hello.class</TT>, runs&#151;but what exactly did you do? Let&#146;s take a look now at the Java code that you entered for <TT>hello.java</TT>, examining it line by line to get a better idea of how Java programming works (even though Java will handle many of these details for you later).</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading10"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Understanding the Hello Example</FONT></H4>
<P>Let&#146;s take apart your first applet now. Begin with this line:
</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;
           .
           .
           .
</PRE>
<P>What does this mean? This line actually points out one of the great advantages of Java programming. When you&#146;re adding menus and separate windows to your Java applets, you can imagine that it would be a great deal of work to create everything from scratch&#151;that is, write the entire code for menu handling, separate window creation, and so forth. Instead of asking you to do so, Java comes complete with several pre-defined libraries, and much of this book will be an examination of the routines in these libraries. You&#146;ll learn more about this later, but what you&#146;re doing is adding support from the main Java graphics library of routines to your applet. In this way, we&#146;ll be able to draw the text string, "Hello from Java!", in the applet&#146;s window.
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>If you&#146;re a C/C&#43;&#43; programmer, you&#146;ll notice that the import statement works much like the C/C&#43;&#43; #include statement.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Next, add this line to <TT>hello.java</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;

  &#8594;public class hello extends java.applet.Applet

  &#8594;&#123;
       .
       .
       .
</PRE>
<P>You&#146;ve just created a Java <I>class</I> named <TT>hello</TT>. What does this mean?</P><P><BR></P>
