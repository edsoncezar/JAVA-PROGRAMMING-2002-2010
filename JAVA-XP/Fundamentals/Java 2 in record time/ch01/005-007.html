<P>Now you&#146;ll use Java itself to create your applet, <TT>hello.class</TT>, from the code, <TT>hello.java</TT>. If you haven&#146;t already done so, you should install the Java Develop-ment Kit (JDK) 1.2. It&#146;s on the CD that came with this book.</P>
<P>With previous versions of Java, you used to have to go through a rather lengthy and involved installation process, but that&#146;s all changed now&#151;you just have to run an <TT>.EXE</TT> file. You get this <TT>.EXE</TT> file online, from <A HREF="http://developer.javasoft.com/">http://developer.javasoft.com</A> &#151;just download it and follow the instructions for installation.</P>
<P>The next step is to make sure you can run the JDK from any location in your computer (including the <TT>c:\java1-2</TT> directory and its subdirectories, which is where you&#146;ll put your Java programs). To do that, make sure the <TT>PATH</TT> statement in your <TT>AUTOEXEC.BAT</TT> file (found in the main directory of the c: drive) includes the JDK <TT>BIN</TT> and <TT>LIB</TT> directories (here I have installed the JDK in <TT>c:\jdk12</TT>&#151;use whatever path is appropriate to the way you have installed the JDK):</P>
<PRE>
   PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\JDK12\JAVA\BIN;C:\JDK12\JAVA\LIB

<P>The JDK 1.2 is ready to go.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can copy the Java documentation from JavaSoft to the same directory&#151;for example,  <TT>c:\JDK12</TT>. Unzip the documentation <TT>.zip</TT> file, creating a <TT>docs</TT> subdirectory (your unzipping program must be able to handle long filenames).</P>

<P>Now that you&#146;ve installed Java 1.2, let&#146;s take a look at what&#146;s new in this version of Java.

<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading6"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What&#146;s New in 1.2?</FONT></H4>
<P>If you&#146;re familiar with Java 1.0 or Java 1.1, then you&#146;d probably expect there to be some changes in Java 1.2, and you&#146;d be right. Let&#146;s get an overview of the changes in this new edition of Java. If you&#146;re not familiar with Java, you should probably skip to the next section and take a look at this material later&#151;much of this won&#146;t make any sense unless you&#146;ve programmed in Java before.
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>From Java 1.0 to Java 1.1</B></FONT></P>
<P>Many readers will be familiar with Java 1.0, not Java 1.1, so we will start by looking at the changes from Java 1.0 to Java 1.1,
</P>
<DL>
<DD><B>Abstract Windowing Toolkit enhancements</B> Java 1.1 supports printing, faster scrolling, popup menus, the clipboard, a delegation-based event model, imaging and graphics enhancements, and more. In addition, it&#146;s faster than Java 1.0 (something Java programmers can definitely appreciate)!
<DD><B>.jar files</B> .jar</TT> (Java Archive) files were introduced in Java 1.1 and let you package a number of files together, zipping them to shrink them, so the user can download many files at once. You can put many applets and the data they need together into one <TT>.jar</TT> file, making downloading much faster. These files are analogous to <TT>.zip</TT> files except that your browser will download them and unzip them on-the-fly for you.
<DD><B>Internationalization</B> Java 1.1 lets you develop <I>locale-specific applets</I>, including using UNICODE characters, a locale mechanism, localized message support, locale-sensitive date, time, time zone, number handling, and more.
<DD><B>Signed applets and digital signatures</B> Java 1.1 can create digitally signed Java applications. A digital signature gives your users a "path" back to you in case something goes wrong. This is part of the new security precautions popular on the World Wide Web.
<DD><B>Remote method invocation</B> In Java 1.1 RMI lets Java objects have their methods invoked from Java code running in other Java sessions. This is sort of similar to Local Remote Procedure Calls (LRPCs).
<DD><B>Object serialization</B> Serialization was new in Java 1.1, and it lets you store objects and handle them with binary input/output streams. Besides allowing you to store copies of the objects you serialize, serialization is also the basis of communication between objects engaged in RMI. Object serialization is similar to MFC Serialization, for those who are familiar with Microsoft&#146;s Foundation Classes.
<DD><B>Reflection</B> In Java 1.1 reflection lets Java code examine information about the methods and constructors of loaded classes and make use of those reflected methods and constructors.
<DD><B>Inner classes</B> Java 1.1 makes it easier to create adapter classes. An adapter class is a class that implements an interface required by an API (Applications Programming Interface). An adapter class "delegates" control back to an enclosing main object.
<DD><B>New Java native method interface</B> Native code is code that is written specifically for a particular machine. In Java 1.1 this interface was introduced to provide a standard programming interface for writing Java native methods. The primary goal is binary compatibility of native method libraries across all Java virtual machine implementations on a given platform. Writing and calling native code can significantly improve execution speeds. Java 1.1 included a powerful new Java native method interface.
<DD><B>Byte, Short, and Void classes</B> In Java 1.1 Byte and short values can be handled as "wrapped" numbers when you use the new Java classes Byte and <TT>Short</TT>. The new <TT>Void</TT> class is a placeholder class that we can derive classes from, rather than use directly.
<DD><B>Deprecated methods</B> Quite a number of Java 1.0 methods were considered obsolete in Java 1.1, and they are marked as deprecated in the Java 1.1 documentation. (The Java compiler now displays a warning when it compiles code that uses a deprecated feature.)
<DD><B>Networking enhancements</B> Networking enhancements in Java 1.1 included support for selected BSD-style socket options in the <TT>java.net</TT> base classes. With Java 1.1, Socket and ServerSocket are non-final, extendable classes. New subclasses of SocketException were added for finer granularity in reporting and handling network errors.
<DD><B>I/O enhancements</B> In Java 1.1, the I/O package was extended with character streams, which are like byte streams except that they contain 16-bit Unicode characters rather than eight-bit bytes. Character streams make it easy to write programs that are independent of a specific character encoding and are therefore easier to internationalize. Nearly all of the functionality available for byte streams is also available for character streams.
</DL>
<P>That completes this overview of what&#146;s new in Java 1.1&#151;if you have no idea what I&#146;m talking about, don&#146;t worry, it&#146;ll become clear later.
