<H3><A NAME="Heading11"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Object-Oriented Programming</FONT></H3>
<P><I>Objects</I> and <I>classes</I> are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented languages like Java. There&#146;s been a lot of hype about object-oriented programming (OOP), and that can make the whole topic seem mysterious and unapproachable. In fact, object-oriented programming was introduced to make longer programs <I>easier</I> to create. We&#146;ll start a mini-survey of object-oriented programming by looking at objects.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading12"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Understanding Java Objects</FONT></H4>
<P>In long, involved programs, there can be a profusion of both variables and functions, sometimes hundreds of each. Creating and maintaining the program code can become a very cluttered task because you have to keep so many things in mind. There may also be unwanted interaction if various functions use variables of the same name. Object-oriented programming was invented to break up such large programs.
</P>
<P>The idea behind objects is quite simple&#151;you just break up your program into the various parts, each of which you can easily conceptualize as performing a discrete task, and those are your objects. For example, you may put all the screen-handling parts of a program together into an object named <TT>screen</TT>. Objects are more powerful than simple functions or sets of variables because an object can hold both functions and variables wrapped up together in a way that makes it easy to use. The <TT>screen</TT> object may hold not only all the data displayed on the screen, but also the functions needed to handle that data, like <TT>drawString()</TT> or <TT>drawLine()</TT>. This means that all the screen handling is hidden from the rest of the program in a convenient way, making the rest of the program easier to handle.</P>
<P>As another example, think of a refrigerator. A refrigerator would be far less useful if you had to regulate all the temperatures and pumps and so forth by hand at all times. Making all those functions internal and automatic to the refrigerator makes it into an easy object to deal with and a useful one: a <I>refrigerator</I>. Wrapping up code and data into objects this way is the basis of object-oriented programming.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading13"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What&#146;s a Java Class?</FONT></H4>
<P>But how do you create objects? That&#146;s where <I>classes</I> come in. A class is to an object what a cookie cutter is to a cookie&#151;a template or blueprint. In terms of programming, you might think of the relationship between a data type, like an integer, and the actual variable itself like this, where you set up an integer named <TT>the_data</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
          int the_data;
</PRE>
<P>This is the actual way to create an integer variable in Java. Here, <TT>int</TT> is the type of variable you are declaring and <TT>the_data</TT> is the variable itself. This is the same relationship that a class has to an object, and informally you may think of a class as an object&#146;s <I>type</I>.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Java supports all the standard C and C&#43;&#43; primitive data types like <TT>int</TT>,<TT> double</TT>,<TT> long</TT>,<TT> float</TT>, and so forth.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For example, if you had set up a class named, say, <TT>graphicsClass</TT>, you can create an object of that class named <TT>screen</TT> this way:</P>
<PRE>
        graphicsClass screen;
</PRE>
<P>You&#146;ll see how to actually create a class soon (creating a class like <TT>graphicsClass</TT> is not hard&#151;when you create a class in code, you will just group all its functions and data inside the class definition), and then you&#146;ll see how to create objects of that class. What&#146;s important to remember is this: the object itself is what holds the data you want to work with; the class itself holds no data but just describes how the object should be set up.</P>
<P>Object-oriented programming at root is nothing more than a way of grouping functions and the data they work on together to make your program less cluttered. You&#146;ll see more about object-oriented programming throughout this book, including how to create a class, how to create an object of that class, and how to reach the functions and data in that object when you want to.</P>
<P>That completes the mini-overview of classes and objects. As you can see, a class is just a programming construct that groups together, or <I>encapsulates</I>, functions and data, and an object may be thought of as a variable of that class&#146;s type, as the object <TT>screen</TT> is to the class <TT>screenclass</TT>.</P>
<P>As it turns out, Java comes complete with several libraries of pre-defined classes, which save you a great deal of work. Throughout this book we will examine these pre-defined and very useful Java classes. Using these predefined classes, we&#146;ll create objects needed to handle buttons, text fields, scroll bars, and much more.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading14"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Learning about Java Packages</FONT></H4>
<P>These class libraries are called <I>packages</I> in Java, and one such library is called <TT>java.awt</TT> (where awt stands for Abstract Window Toolkit). This library holds the <TT>Graphics</TT> class, which will handle the graphics work you undertake. So this line in the first applet:</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;
</PRE>
<P>actually means that you want to include the Java Graphics class and make use of it in your program. In a minute, you will use an object of the Graphics class for your graphics output.
</P>
<P>You&#146;ve added support for graphics handling by including the <TT>java.awt.Graphics</TT> class (and in Java, displaying the text string "Hello from Java!" is considered graphics handling). Next, it&#146;s time to set up your hello applet itself. To do so, define a new class named <TT>hello</TT>. This is the standard way of setting up an applet in Java, and in fact, the applet itself has the file extension <TT>.class</TT>. That&#146;s because each class defined in a <TT>.java</TT> file ends up being exported to a <TT>.class</TT> file, where you can make use of it. You&#146;ll learn more details about this soon.</P>
<P>It would be quite difficult to write all the code an applet class needs from scratch. For example, we&#146;d need to interact with the Web browser, reserve a section of screen, initialize the appropriate Java packages, and much more. It turns out that all that functionality is already built into the Java <TT>Applet</TT> class, which is part of the <TT>java.applet</TT> package. But how do you make use of the <TT>Applet</TT> class? You want to customize the applet to display your text string, and the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class itself knows nothing about that.</P><P><BR></P>
