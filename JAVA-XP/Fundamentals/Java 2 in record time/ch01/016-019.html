<P>You can customize the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class by <I>deriving</I> the <TT>hello</TT> class from the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class. This makes <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> the <I>base</I> class of the <TT>hello</TT> class, and it makes <TT>hello</TT> a class derived from <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT>. This gives you all the power of the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class without the worries of writing it yourself, and you can add what you want to this class by adding code to your derived class <TT>hello</TT>.</P>
<P>This is an important part of object-oriented programming, and it&#146;s called <I>inheritance</I>. In this way, a derived class inherits the functionality of its base class and adds more on top of it. For example, you may have a base class called <TT>chassis</TT>. You can derive various classes from this base class called, say, <TT>car</TT> and <TT>truck</TT>. In this way, two derived classes can share the same base class, saving time and effort programmatically. Although the <TT>car</TT> and <TT>truck</TT> classes share the same base class, <TT>chassis</TT>, they added different items to the base class, ending up as two quite different classes, <TT>car</TT> and <TT>truck</TT>.</P>
<P>Using inheritance, then, you will <I>extend</I> the base class <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> by creating your own class <TT>hello</TT> and adding onto the base class. Indicate that the <TT>hello</TT> class is derived from the <TT>java</TT>.<TT>applet</TT>.<TT>Applet</TT> class like this (note that you use the keyword <I>class</I> to indicate that you are defining a new class):</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;

  &#8594;public class hello extends java.applet.Applet
  &#8594;&#123;
       .
       .
       .
</PRE>
<P>In starting to set up the new class, <TT>hello</TT>, you&#146;ve given it all the power of the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class (like the ability to request space from the Web browser and to respond to many browser-created commands). But how do you make additions and even alterations to the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class to customize your own <TT>hello</TT> class? How do you display your text string? One way is by <I>overriding</I> the base class&#146;s built-in functions (overriding is an important part of object-oriented programming). When you re-define a base class&#146;s function in a derived class, the new version of the function is the one that takes over. In this way, you can customize the functions from the base class as you like them in the derived class.</P>
<P>For example, one function in the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class is called <TT>paint()</TT>. This is a very important function that is called when the Web browser tells the applet to create its display on the screen. This happens when the applet first begins and every time it has to be re-displayed later (for example, if the Web browser was minimized and then maximized, or if some window was moved and the applet&#146;s display area was uncovered after having been covered).</P>
<P>Your goal in the <TT>hello</TT> class is to display the string "Hello from Java!" on the screen, and in fact, you will override the <TT>java.applet.Applet</TT> class&#146;s <TT>paint()</TT> function to do so. You override a base class&#146;s function simply by redefining it in the new class. Do that now for the <TT>paint()</TT> function, noting first that the built-in functions of a class are called that class&#146;s <I>methods</I>. In this case, then, you override (that is, re-define) the <TT>paint()</TT> method like this:</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.Graphics;

   public class hello extends java.applet.Applet
   &#123;
  &#8594;    public void paint( Graphics g )[
       &#123;
           .
           .
           .

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>The built-in functions of a class are called <I>methods</I>. Classes can also have built-in variables&#151;called <I>data</I> <I>members</I>&#151;and even constants. Collectively, all these parts are called a class&#146;s <I>members</I>.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4 ALIGN="LEFT"><A NAME="Heading16"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What Are Java Access Modifiers?</FONT></H4>
<P>The keyword <I>public</I> is called an <I>access modifier</I>. A class&#146;s methods can be declared <TT>public</TT>, <TT>private</TT>, or <TT>protected</TT>. If they are declared <TT>public</TT>, then you can call them from anywhere in the program, not just in the class in which they are defined. If they are <TT>private</TT>, they may be called from only the class in which they are defined. If they are <TT>protected</TT>, they may be called in only the class in which they are defined and the classes derived from that class.</P>
<P>Next, indicate the <I>return</I> type of the <TT>paint()</TT> method. When you call a method, you can pass parameters to it, and it can return data to you. In this case, <TT>paint()</TT> has no return value, which you indicate with the return type <I>void</I>. Other return types are <TT>int</TT> for an integer return value (this variable is usually 32 bits long), <TT>long</TT> for a long integer (this variable is usually 64 bits long), <TT>float</TT> for a floating point return, or <TT>double</TT> for a double-precision floating point value. You can also return arrays and objects in Java.</P>
<P>Finally, note that you indicate that the <TT>paint()</TT> method is automatically passed one parameter&#151;an object of the <TT>Graphics</TT> class called <TT>g</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
    import java.awt.Graphics;

    public class hello extends java.applet.Applet
    &#123;
   &#8594;    public void paint(Graphics g)
        &#123;   .
            .
            .
</PRE>
<P>This Graphics object represents the physical display of the applet. That is, you can use the built-in methods of this object&#151;such as <TT>drawImage()</TT>, <TT>drawLine()</TT>, <TT>drawOval()</TT>, and others&#151;to drawn on the screen. In this case, you want to place the string "Hello from Java!" on the screen, and you can do that with the <TT>drawString()</TT> method.</P><P><BR></P>
