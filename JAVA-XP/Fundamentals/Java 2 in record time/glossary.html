<DL>
<DT><B>API (Application Programming Interface)</B>
<DD>A collection of classes, methods, and data members that you can import into Java.
<DT><B>Applet</B>
<DD>A compiled Java program that can be embedded in a Web page and downloaded to run in a Web browser.
<DT><B>AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit)</B>
<DD>The Java package of user interface methods, which handles graphics and windows.
</DL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>b</B></FONT></P>
<DL>
<DT><B>base class</B>
<DD>Class from which another class is derived.
<DT><B>boolean</B>
<DD>A variable type. Boolean variables may be set to only true or false.
<DT><B>bytecodes</B>
<DD>Java executable binary codes that make up applets. Bytecodes are what the compiler produces; they make up <TT>.class</TT> files.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>cast</B>
<DD>A means of overriding a variable&#146;s type, temporarily changing that type to another type.
<DT><B>check box group</B>
<DD>A collection of radio buttons. When check boxes are added to a Java <TT>CheckBoxGroup</TT> object, they become radio buttons.
<DT><B>class</B>
<DD>The &#147;template&#148; used to create objects, much like a variable&#146;s type (e.g., <TT>integer</TT>). A class is to an object what a cookie cutter is to a cookie.
<DT><B>class library</B>
<DD>Libraries that contain various Java classes. These libraries are called packages in Java.
<DT><B>client</B>
<DD>One half of a client/server pair. Clients rely on a server to perform some task for them.
<DT><B>client/server model</B>
<DD>Splitting an application into two parts, one part in the client and one part in the server, creates a client/server pair. Applications that work this way use the client/server model.
<DT><B>clipping rectangle</B>
<DD>A graphics rectangle bounding a part of the display area to which you want to restrict graphics operations.
<DT><B>compiler</B>
<DD>A program that translates Java source code into runnable bytecodes. In other words, a compiler translates <TT>.java</TT> files into <TT>.class</TT> files.
<DT><B>constructor</B>
<DD>An automatically-run method of a class, used for initialization of an object. A constructor is run whenever an object of the class containing the constructor is created.
<DT><B>container</B>
<DD>An object of the Java <TT>Container</TT> class. A container can contain control objects.
<DT><B>control</B>
<DD>Any of the various user interface objects, such as text fields, text areas, scroll bars, and buttons.
<DT><B>critical section</B>
<DD>A section of code where threads should be allowed to undertake their tasks without interference. In Java, a critical section is enclosed in a <TT>sychronized()</TT> block.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>d</B></FONT></P>
<DL>
<DT><B>debugger</B>
<DD>An application that lets you execute a Java program while watching the program&#146;s state. The execution of a debugger is often line by line.
<DT><B>double buffering</B>
<DD>A graphics method of preparing images off screen in a memory buffer and then displaying the result on screen.
</DL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>e</B></FONT></P>
<DL>
<DT><B>encapsulation</B>
<DD>The process of wrapping both data and functions into classes.
<DT><B>event</B>
<DD>A user-interface&#150;triggered occurrence, such as a mouse click, a button push, or a key strike.
<DT><B>exception</B>
<DD>An error message that usually indicates a problem in program flow. For example, when you try to index an array beyond its boundaries, an array-boundary exception occurs.
</DL>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>f</B></FONT></P>
<DL>
<DT><B>frame</B>
<DD>The outline or border of a window or of an individual image in animation.
