<P>Placing <TT>text1</TT> in your applet makes it a <I>global class variable</I>. What I mean by global is that it will be available to all the methods (built-in functions) of the text class and to all the code in those methods, because it is declared outside any such method.</P>
<P>As far as variables go, a variable is just a place set aside in memory for data; you will find that variable&#146;s numeric data types in Java are just the same as most standard Basic, C, or C&#43;&#43; implementations. For example, to set aside space for integer data, we set up an integer variable of type <TT>int</TT>:</P>
<PRE>
   int the_integer;
</PRE>
<P>To place values in a variable, just assign them to that variable as follows:
</P>
<PRE>
   the_integer = 5;
</PRE>
<P>The built-in Java numeric data types like <TT>int</TT> and <TT>float</TT> appear in Table 2.2.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>It is usually good to restrict the number of global class variables you use to a minimum. Because these variables can be reached anywhere, there is always the possibility of conflict with another variable of the same name in one of your methods. Using too many global variables goes directly against the spirit of object-oriented programming, which was originally developed to handle larger programs by getting variables and methods out of the global space, placing them in objects to clear the global space of clutter.<HR></FONT>

<H3><A NAME="Heading3"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Initializing with the <I>init()</I> Method
</FONT></H3>
<P>Declaring a text field just sets aside memory for it and does nothing to display it in your applet. You have to handle that yourself in the <TT>init()</TT> method.</P>
<P>When you want to initialize an applet, by, for example, adding text fields to it, you do that in the <TT>init()</TT> method. As you&#146;ll see throughout this book, all kinds of initialization can take place in the <TT>init()</TT> function. It runs automatically when the applet starts, so you should place code that you want run first in the <TT>init()</TT> function. To use <TT>init()</TT>, just add it to your class as follows:</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.*;

   public class text extends java.applet.Applet
   &#123;
       TextField text1;

   &#8594;   public void init()
       &#123;
       .
       .
       .
   &#8594;   &#125;

   &#125;
</PRE>
<P>Note that the <TT>init()</TT> function is like any other function, except that it doesn&#146;t return a value (which is why the return type is listed as <TT>void</TT> above) and it runs automatically when the applet starts. Your task in <TT>init()</TT> is to create the new text field and install it in your applet. Creating Java controls is a two-step process: first declare the new object as you have done above, and then create the new object in the <TT>init()</TT> function, using the Java <TT>new</TT> operator.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading4"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">Handling Memory with the <I>new</I> Operator
</FONT></H3>
<P>The Java <TT>new</TT> operator is just like the C&#43;&#43; <TT>new</TT> operator; it is used to allocate memory for objects, variables, arrays&#151;for anything you&#146;d like. If you know C, the <TT>new</TT> operator largely replaces <TT>malloc()</TT>, <TT>calloc()</TT>, and all the memory allocation functions&#151;and it is much easier to work with.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>While the standard memory-allocating functions like <TT>malloc()</TT> and <TT>calloc()</TT> in C are functions, the <TT>new</TT> operator is indeed an operator (like &#43;, &#151;, and so on), not a function. This operator is a built-in part of Java and does not come from any class library.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Let&#146;s put the <TT>new</TT> operator to work. Create your new object named <TT>text1</TT> in your applet&#146;s <TT>init()</TT> method, using the following syntax:</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.*;

   public class text extends java.applet.Applet
   &#123;
       TextField text1;
       public void init()
       &#123;
   &#8594;       text1 = new TextField();
               .
               .
               .
       &#125;

   &#125;
</PRE>
<P>This syntax creates a new <TT>TextField</TT> object and places it in the <TT>text1</TT> variable. This is a two-step process that you&#146;ll see many times in this book: you first <I>declare</I> a control&#146;s object and then use the <TT>new</TT> operator to <I>create</I> that object in the <TT>init()</TT> method.</P>
<P>The above new line of code creates a new text field, but it&#146;s only one character wide. To make the text field, say, 20 characters wide, pass a value of 20 to the <TT>TextField</TT> class&#146;s <I>constructor</I>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Heading5"></A><FONT COLOR="#000077">What Are Java Constructors?</FONT></H3>
<P>Using constructors is a very popular technique in object-oriented programming; a constructor for a particular class is simply a method that is automatically run when you create an object of that class, and its purpose is to initialize that object as you want it. That is, constructors are used to initialize objects. A class&#146;s constructor is called when a new object is being created of that class, and you can set the object up as you like it. Because a constructor is a method, you can pass data to constructors (if they are written to accept such data), allowing us to set up an object as you want when that object is created. In this case, you&#146;ll pass a value of 20 to your new text field&#146;s constructor. You can do that using the following syntax:
</P>
<PRE>
   import java.awt.*;

   public class text extends java.applet.Applet
   &#123;
       TextField text1;

       public void init()
       &#123;
   &#8594;          text1 = new TextField(20);
               .
               .
               .
       &#125;
</PRE>
<P>This makes your new text field 20 characters wide. If you wanted to set up an initial string in the text field instead of using a set number of characters, you could just pass that string to <TT>TextField&#146;s</TT> constructor as follows:</P>
<PRE>
        text1 = new TextField(&#147;Welcome to Java&#148;);
