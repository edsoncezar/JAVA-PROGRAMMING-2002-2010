<P><BIG><BIG>J</BIG></BIG>ava is very, very popular right now, and no wonder: Java has transformed the Web and Web programming in many ways. Java makes your Web pages come alive, displaying buttons, menus, images, and animation. Because you can program for many different types of computers using Java, Java applications have also become very popular. And now that Java has arrived in its new 1.2 version, it&#146;s even more popular than before. As more and more Web browsers become Java-enabled, as more and more computers support Java, its popularity continues to spread.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Why Use Java?</B></FONT></P>
<P>Although it&#146;s possible to create Web pages without Java, they just can&#146;t compare to Java pages. Rather than have static images, why not have something that <I>moves</I>? Rather than have text that doesn&#146;t change, why not allow the user to enter their own text? There&#146;s nothing like an interactive Web page to get the attention of casual Web surfers.</P>
<P>Java is coming into its own as a programming language for non-Web applications as well. This is because it&#146;s a very powerful cross-platform language, allowing you to develop programs on one computer type and run them on many others. In today&#146;s world, that&#146;s a strong reason to use Java. Java 1.2 allows you many powerful options, from popup menus to using the clipboard to JAR files, from the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) to using the Java 2D graphics rendering system. We&#146;re going to explore them all in this book.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>How This Book Is Organized</B></FONT></P>
<P>Our emphasis in this book will be seeing Java 1.2 at work and giving you the skills needed to use it effectively. If you want to get something from a programming book, there&#146;s nothing like seeing working code. Many programming books start off with abstractions, programming constructs, and theory; but here you will look at Java not as an end in itself but as a tool for creating programs you are interested in.
</P>
<P>In this book, you&#146;ll see things from a different point of view&#151;the getting things done point of view. Instead of chapters named &#147;If Statements,&#148; &#147;Java Modifiers,&#148; or &#147;Abstract Java Classes,&#148; each unit in this book teaches a specific skill, such as &#147;Check Boxes,&#148; &#147;Radio Buttons,&#148; &#147;Menus,&#148; and &#147;Graphics Animation.&#148; You&#146;ll put Java to work creating the programs you want.</P>
<P>You&#146;ll work through plenty of bite-sized examples because trying to learn Java without running it is like trying to learn to fly by reading an airplane parts manual. These examples will be short and to the point, covering topics such as:</P>

<P>The plan, then, is to put Java to work for you, using all its power and classes in the process of creating working Java programs. Java has a great deal to offer, and you&#146;ll see just about all of it in this book, from creating Java applets to creating Java applications; from creating new dialog boxes to printing directly from a program. Java provides a great many tools, and you&#146;ll use them fully as you create the programs in this book.
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Look What&#146;s on the CD and Beyond!</B></FONT></P>
<P>The code you&#146;ll use in this book will also appear on the CD-ROM, which means that you don&#146;t have to type anything in as you work through the examples. It&#146;s all there on the CD-ROM. You&#146;ll find the .<TT>java</TT> files, which hold the source code for the programs, and the <TT>.class </TT>files, which are ready to run. To install the files on your hard disk, see the <TT>readme.txt</TT> file in the CD-ROM&#146;s root directory.</P>
<P>This book also has a companion Web site. You can reach the site by clicking the hotlink on the CD, or you can point your Web browser to <A HREF="http://library.cs.tuiasi.ro/programming/java/java_2_in_record_time/www.sybex.com">www.sybex.com</A>. On the Web site, you&#146;ll find links to companies that provide shareware, demos, and other utilities you can use with Java 1.2.</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Conventions Used in This Book</B></FONT></P>
<P>The examples in this book will be built incrementally; when you add a new line or lines of code, the new lines will be indicated with arrows, like this:
</P>
<PRE>
     drawbutton = new Button(&#147;Draw freehand&#148;);
     linebutton = new Button(&#147;Draw a line&#148;);
&#8594;    ovalbutton = new Button(&#147;Draw an oval&#148;);
&#8594;    rectbutton = new Button(&#147;Draw a rectangle&#148;);
&#8594;    roundedbutton = new Button(&#147;Draw a rounded rectangle&#148;);
</PRE>
<P>Some of the lines of code will be followed by continuation arrows (&#8658;). This means that the entire line of code would not fit on one line in the text. The line of code after the continuation arrow should be written on the same line as the code preceding the continuation arrow when you write your code. For example, this should be written as one line of code:
</P>
<PRE>
       ptDrawTo = new Point(Math.max(ptAnchor.x, ptDrawTo.x), &#8658;
  Math.max(ptAnchor.y, ptDrawTo.y));
</PRE>
<P>You&#146;ll also find complete code listings for programs marked by code listing headings to let you know the code is available on the CD.
</P>
<P>Throughout the book, Notes, Tips, and Warnings appear to give you extra insight.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Notes indicate points of special concern such as why working with the mouse one way instead of another is important at a particular time, or what you can do with one Web browser in Java that you can&#146;t with another.<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>TIP:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Tips are written to save you time or to point out additional helpful information, such as a programming shortcut.
<HR></FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><HR><B>WARNING:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>A Warning tells you about common programming errors or other potential mix-ups you should watch out for.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>What You&#146;ll Need</B></FONT></P>
<P>Although Java is an object-oriented language, you don&#146;t need to have object-oriented programming experience to use this book. If you do have experience with an object-oriented programming language, there&#146;s still a lot to learn from this book.
</P>
<P>You&#146;ll need an editor or word processor, such as Microsoft WordPad, to enter your Java programs into files you can compile and run. Your editor or word processor must be able to save files in simple text format.</P>
<P>And, of course, to use your completed Java programs on the Web, you should have a place to host your Web pages. Although Java can produce stand-alone applications, the majority of Java programmers target the Web in their Java development. In Skill 1, you&#146;ll learn how to embed Java applets in a Web page.</P>
<P>Your Internet service provider should be able to instruct you on how to upload your applets so you can use them in your Web pages. Usually you need to find out where to install your Web pages and applets (what directory in the ISP computer), and then you can use a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program to upload your files to that directory.</P>
<P>You can find more information about Java on the Internet. Some resources include Sun&#146;s Java site, <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/">http://www.javasoft.com</A> and <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/doc">http://www.javasoft.com/doc</A>. You can also check out the Usenet group <TT>comp.lang.java.programmer</TT>. For updates to this book, visit the Sybex site, <A HREF="http://www.sybex.com/">http://www.sybex.com</A>.</P><P><BR></P>
