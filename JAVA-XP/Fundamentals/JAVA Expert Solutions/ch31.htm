The Internet has provided a tremendous opportunity for business.
Many millions have already been made by businesses related to
the Internet and companies that have taken advantage of the Internet's
unique features. Like any financial medium, the Internet has sparked
concerns about the safety and reliability of doing business online.
Part of this hesitation stems from the fact that there is no real
standard for conducting secure, safe, and simple transactions
online. Although several methods do exist for Internet commerce,
they are all built upon proprietary protocols and existing, static
payment methods. Although most of these systems now have secure
encryption-based security, none provides a comprehensive solution
for developers and entrepreneurs seeking to conduct business over
the Internet.
<P>
This is where the JECF comes into play. As an open, cross-platform,
extensible API, it has all the advantages of Java without the
drawbacks of proprietary protocols. In short, it is the first
all-inclusive solution for online commerce.<BR>

Although the JECF is still only in the specification phase, it is important to understand the concepts behind it. You may not be able to create an application using the JECF today, but you can start planning for it today. You can design your current 
applications so they can take advantage of the JECF when it becomes available. A good system designer always looks to the horizon to see what's coming and designs with future extensions in mind.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="TheDifficultiesofElectronicCommerce"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
The Difficulties of Electronic Commerce</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The problems associated with online commerce are many. Understanding
why the JECF is so well-suited to the task of conducting business
online requires a full understanding of the difficulties involved.
<H3><A NAME="TheftofInformation">
Theft of Information</A></H3>
<P>
The first main difficulty in electronic commerce is, ironically,
both the easiest to solve and the source of the most consternation:
the theft of important information. People who are wary of electronic
commerce fear that their credit card number, or other personal
information, will be stolen by &quot;hackers&quot; or other miscreants
and used for illicit purposes. Luckily, with the advent of public-key
encryption, and its implementation in the Java Security API and
Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0, intercepting encrypted
information across the Internet is nearly impossible.
<H3><A NAME="FraudulentPrograms">
Fraudulent Programs</A></H3>
<P>
Good encryption does not necessarily equal good security, however.
Especially with a comprehensive commerce system, there are many
points at which a hostile applet or application could gain access
to sensitive system information. These problems can potentially
increase in an object-oriented environment such as Java. For instance,
an applet posing as a legitimate service provider could make illegitimate
charges on a user's credit card, unless sufficient preventative
measures are taken.
<H3><A NAME="ProprietarySolutions">
Proprietary Solutions</A></H3>
<P>
Other barriers to electronic commerce include proprietary protocols
and solutions. Every time a developer tries to write an application
for conducting online commerce, he or she must overcome the same
set of problems (encryption, security, and so on) from scratch.
This is redundant and makes commercial Internet development expensive
and time-consuming. In addition, developers who use existing protocols
are often locked in to a specific commerce system. For instance,
many credit card companies have their own centralized network
for conducting electronic transactions. However, in order to access
this network, developers must use the protocols established by
that specific company-which may or may not be compatible with
other companies. An application that supports many protocols can
become bulky and hard to manage.
<H3><A NAME="StaticSolutions">
Static Solutions</A></H3>
<P>
Further, existing commerce solutions are based on existing forms
of commerce-mainly credit cards and checks. A comprehensive solution
must account for many other forms of transactions, and most importantly,
must be able to adapt to future forms, like game tokens, cash
cards, &quot;smart&quot; cards, and so on. A dynamic extensible
architecture such as this is essentially absent from the field
of Internet commerce.
<H3><A NAME="PlatformDependence">
Platform-Dependence</A></H3>
<P>
Even commerce systems that overcome these problems often run into
the barrier of single-platform support. Because the Internet is
made up of numerous types of computers running many different
operating systems, a commerce system needs to support this wide
range.
<H2><A NAME="CreatingOnlineServiceswiththeJECF"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Creating Online Services with the JECF</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Every aspect of the JECF was designed to combat one of these potential
problems in an online transaction. One offshoot of this is that
many parts of the API are complex, often taking two or three steps
to accomplish-securely-what might have been accomplished in one
insecure step. Also keep in mind that, as of August, 1996, the
full JECF API has not been published; it is still under development
by JavaSoft and its corporate partners. All JavaSoft has done
thus far is to publish a theoretical framework (the JECF White
Paper) that details what the goals and structure of the finished
API will be. Do not be surprised if this changes somewhat in the
months to come.
<P>
The JECF, like all other Java APIs, is made up of several key
classes. They are divided into several packages based on their
function. These separate pieces interact to provide the full functionality
of the JECF. Each component acts independently in order to increase
the security of the whole system. They are all contained in something
called the Java Wallet, which manages all transactions relating
to the user.
<P>
The JECF is centered around the Java Wallet. Each user has his
or her own wallet which contains a number of cassettes. Cassettes
are to a wallet what an applet is to a browser. Cassettes provide
some form of financial service to a wallet. In a way, cassettes
are like credit cards. When you are shopping and go to pay for
something, you open your wallet and select an appropriate credit
card (or that old-fashioned cash stuff). When you perform an online
transaction, you may select a payment cassette from your wallet.
The online service then interacts with your cassette, which may,
in turn, interact with your credit card company or an electronic
cash server.
<H2><A NAME="StoringInformationintheWalletDatabase"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Storing Information in the Wallet Database</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
One of the most important parts of the Java Wallet is the Wallet
database. This stores all kinds of information about the Wallet's
owner, including a record of all previous transactions conducted
using the Wallet. Because of the sensitive but useful nature of
this information, the Wallet must be simultaneously secure yet
robust and accessible-never an easy compromise! Each cassette
is allowed to keep its own data in the Wallet database. When you
write a cassette, you can count on the Wallet database being available
so you can store any data that you may need the next time the
cassette is used.
<H3><A NAME="KeepingDataSafe">
Keeping Data Safe</A></H3>
<P>
The Wallet database provides only limited access to its information.
Access to the database is managed by a system of <TT>Permit</TT>
objects that designate certain roles to various components. Components
wishing to gain access to the database can have one of three roles:
<TT>DatabaseOwner</TT> (the Wallet,
the Wallet's owner, and any classes designated by the user), <TT>DatabaseUser
</TT>(any applet, cassette, or component seeking to use
some information stored in the database), and <TT>DatabaseMaintainer</TT>
(applets and objects that perform maintenance or non-financial
functions on the database). These roles are delegated by the database
based upon a user-configurable understanding of which objects
are to be trusted with the various roles. When an object applies
for a <TT>Permit</TT> from the database,
it must be authenticated and digitally signed by a trusted agency.
The user has final control over which objects get access to what
information.
<P>
The Wallet database can also give access to specific <TT>Table</TT>
or <TT>Row</TT> objects. These classes
comprise the internal structure of the Wallet database, and each
class operatesindependently to ensure the security of its contents.
Permits can be registered at this level, so that outside objects
can be given access to only a small part of the database rather
than the entire thing. Table and Row permits and roles are the
same as those used in the <TT>database</TT>
class, only they apply to a smaller region of the database.
<H3><A NAME="PerformingTransactions">
Performing Transactions</A></H3>
<P>
The Wallet database has classes for conducting all kinds of transactions.
These include record-keeping transactions, as well as user interactions
and exchanges of money, goods, or services. Each type of transaction
has its own class type that determines its parameters and functionality.
Transactions can also be extended to include more interesting
exchanges, such as barter agreements or contracts. Further, the
JECF can create tallies, which are essentially electronic receipts
for products purchased. All of this provides a robust framework
for conducting commerce.
<H4>Database Transactions and User Transactions</H4>
<P>
These are the two most common forms of transactions in the database.
Database transactions include the storage of transaction information
and are discussed in detail in the &quot;Backing out Pending Transactions&quot;
section of this chapter. User transactions are those in which
the Wallet's owner makes a purchase using a payment cassette,
and are discussed throughout this chapter, most notably in the
shopping cart and cassette sections.
<H4>Making Electronic Purchases </H4>
<P>
An exchange transaction is an extension of the standard user transaction
in which money is exchanged for goods. In an exchange transaction,
any kind of value can be traded, including money, but also including
trades for stock, goods, services, time, and so on. In fact, this
opens up the possibility of having online contracts, which could
be legally as legitimate and binding as paper contracts. This
requires that digital signing be extended from applets and cassettes
to create <I>signable documents</I>, which requires a whole other
set of protocols and classes for authenticating user signatures
and enforcing contracts signed online. These issues, however,
are still a long way off - signable applets will probably not
become a reality until 1997, and signable documents will probably
take another year.
<H4>Performing Multi-Party Transactions </H4>
<P>
Complex transactions are just like regular exchange transactions,
except that they can include more than two parties. This is ideal
for multiple-party sales, or loans involving a third party. This
could also make it possible for groups of people to form contracts
with companies-perhaps an online mutual fund could contract with
all of its members at once. This type of transaction has the advantage
of being fully adaptable to a variety of circumstances-it is not
locked into traditional two-party contracts, but can be used for
just about anything. This helps maintain the dynamic nature of
the JECF.
<H4>Implementing Digital Cash with Microtransactions</H4>
<P>
Microtransactions are used by companies to issue cash substitutes
such as cash cards or tokens. These transactions allow small,
predefined charges to be made against a pre-authorized account.
This would allow gaming companies to issue online tokens redeemable
for games, with the money charges being made against a special
company account. Or, a company could issue coupons or vouchers
that could be used to purchase certain products from a third party,
which would be paid out of the issuing company's account. Microtransactions
are important because they allow companies to engage in non-cash
sales and promotions. Because many people are wary about spending
their own money online, this gives Internet vendors the opportunity
to let users &quot;win&quot; tokens or coupons and then redeem
those for prizes. Services such as Riddler (<TT><B><A HREF="http://www.riddler.com/">http://www.riddler.com</A></B></TT>)
allow users to play games and earn &quot;CAPS,&quot; which can
be redeemed for certain prizes that the company buys. While this
is effective, the JECF allows such companies to issue same-as-cash
tokens that can be redeemed at other vendor locations, thus freeing
them to provide a much wider variety of services.
<H2><A NAME="ImplementingaTTFONTSIZEFACECourierShoppingCartFONTTTFONTSIZEAppletwiththeJECFFONT"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Implementing a <TT>Shopping Cart</TT>
Applet with the JECF</FONT></FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The process of purchasing products is handled by a <TT>Shopping
Cart</TT> applet. This is the basic unit of user interaction.
When a user chooses to make a purchase, it is this applet which
must load the necessary JECF components and ensure that the transaction
completes successfully. It is also responsible for authenticating
the user and establishing a secure link. Rather than completing
a sale in one step, as many online commerce programs do today,
the <TT>Shopping Cart</TT> uses a
three-step process.
<P>
First, the user selects the goods to be purchased from the vendor.
Next, the applet shows a tally of the items selected and allows
the user to select a payment method. Before the final transaction
is conducted, the applet constructs a page displaying the total
prices registered by the Java Wallet. This is different from the
previous tally page, because this one is constructed locally-displaying
the <I>actual </I>charges incurred rather than the ones displayed
by the vendor. If these two sets of prices do not match, the user
can abort the transaction. This is the vendor's only chance to
charge money to the user's account (or credit card, and so on.);
they cannot charge more or less than is registered with the Wallet.
Further, no financial information about the user is transmitted
to the vendor; all transactions are handled by the Wallet on a
separate secure link.
<H2><A NAME="OfferingServiceswithCassettes"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Offering Services with Cassettes</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The actual work of transacting money is done by small portable
objects called <I>Cassettes</I>. Each Cassette implements a specific
<I>payment </I>or <I>service </I>protocol. Cassettes are provided
by vendors, who may or may not charge a fee for their use. Cassettes
are a convenient method for software distribution, because any
Java object (applet, servlet, and so on) can become a cassette
by simply conforming to the JECF <TT>Cassette</TT>
Interface. This means that currently existing Java products will
have an easy transition to the JECF.
<H3>Registering Payments with Payment Cassettes</H3>
<P>
Payment cassettes are provided by money management companies such
as banks and credit card providers. These cassettes contain the
necessary instructions to access a user's account with one of
these companies. From the user's perspective, this provides a
convenient way to add new payment instruments; they simply request
a cassette corresponding to a particular credit card or bank account.
From the standpoint of companies, this provides an easy way to
give their customers online access to their accounts in a secure,
standard, cross-platform way.
<H3><A NAME="CreatingOtherWalletServices">
Creating Other Wallet Services</A></H3>
<P>
The other kind of cassette is called a <I>service cassette</I>.
These cassettes are modules that provide non-payment kinds of
services, such as accounting or budget management. Service cassettes
are used mainly to access and maintain the user's financial database.
For instance, a tax cassette might automatically fill out online
tax forms for a user based upon his or her online purchases. This
provides developers with an ideal way to create lightweight, portable
financial applications without requiring the user to enter in
redundant data; all records are kept securely by the Java Wallet.
Only cassettes that are designated as safe by the user have access
to the Java Database.
<H3><A NAME="EnsuringCassetteSecurity">
Ensuring Cassette Security</A></H3>
<P>
The JECF takes many measures to ensure the security of the user's
data, and to prevent access to it by a malicious applet or cassette.
One of the most important security measures implemented in the
JECF is <I>digital signing. </I>This is a process whereby one
or more trusted entities certify that a particular piece of Java
code is safe and reliable. If the code is tampered with in any
way, the digital signature is invalidated, thus ensuring that
Java applets or packages remain unchanged since their last digital
signature.
<H4>Digitally Signing Cassettes</H4>
<P>
JECF cassettes require a digital signature in order to gain access
to the Java Wallet database. Based on a cassette's signature,
the User can assign to the cassette a level of &quot;trust.&quot;
This trust is used by the Wallet to grant various <I>roles </I>to
the cassette. A role determines what parts of the JECF system
a cassette or applet can access. As an example, Sun describes
a service Cassette that provides backup and restore services for
the Java Wallet database. This Cassette needs to be granted a
&quot;maintenance&quot; role in order to gain read and write privileges
for the database.
<H4>Controlling Cassette Access</H4>
<P>
Two important classes to maintaining Cassette and Wallet security
are the <TT>PassPhrase</TT> and Access
Control List (ACL) classes. These two classes are used to determine
which roles are assigned to which cassettes. Although only loosely
defined in the prerelease API, the <TT>PassPhrase</TT>
class will provide user authentication services for each wallet,
thus preventing unauthorized access by any user other than the
owner of the wallet. Each wallet must have a <TT>PassPhrase</TT>
associated with each user. The ACL provides a similar service
for cassettes loaded into the wallet. Just like each wallet must
have a <TT>PassPhrase</TT>, each wallet
component or cassette must have an ACL that determines what other
components or cassettes can gain access to it. This requires signing
and other authentication routines in each and every Wallet component.
Although this is cumbersome, having each object operate separately
makes the whole system much more secure.
<H4>Creating Unique Cassette Identities </H4>
<P>
The identity of a Cassette is provided by the entity that signed
it. Every Cassette must have a special <TT>Identity</TT>
object that is used to give the user (and the JECF system) accurate
information about the behaviors of the cassette. This <TT>Identity</TT>
is digitally signed to prevent tampering. Further, to prevent
another cassette from &quot;borrowing&quot; its signed status,
the cassette makes use of a <TT>Ticket</TT>
object. <TT>Tickets</TT> are an indirect
method of accessing the <TT>Identity</TT>
object. Because of security considerations, the <TT>Identity</TT>
object cannot be directly accessed; this might allow a malicious
applet to steal its <TT>Identity</TT>.
Instead, a Cassette generates a <TT>Ticket</TT>
object based upon its <TT>Identity</TT>.
Although a <TT>Ticket</TT> can be
created from an <TT>Identity</TT>,
the reverse is not true. When queries are made of the <TT>Ticket</TT>,
it fetches the required information from the Cassette <TT>Identity</TT>,
but does not contain this information itself. The process is very
much like the pointers used by Java to represent data in memory;
the <TT>Ticket</TT> (pointer) allows
the data (<TT>Identity</TT>) to be
accessed, but does not actually contain the data itself. This,
combined with the digital signature and shopping cart security
measures, makes it virtually impossible for anyone to gain access
to a user's personal financial information by posing as a legitimate
vendor.
<H3><A NAME="DealingwithSystemFailures">
Dealing with System Failures</A></H3>
<P>
Another important aspect of the Java Wallet is the way in which
it ensures reliable transactions. Even more so than in the &quot;real&quot;
world, Internet transactions are prone to both human and computer
error. The Internet itself is chaotic and fluctuating, and a huge
number of problems could easily arise during the simplest of transactions.
Servers going down, power outages, software or hardware bugs,
viruses, and incompetent operators can all interrupt a transaction
at any stage. In order for an electronic commerce system to be
fully robust, it must be able to handle such problems with style
and grace. It should also give users and vendors a way of resolving
any disputes that arise from botched transactions. The JECF provides
methods for both canceling a transaction that has encountered
errors and also for resolving transaction disputes between users
and vendors.
<H4>Backing out Pending Transactions</H4>
<P>
A transaction is never permanently written to the Wallet database
until it is completely finished. During the various stages of
the transaction, information is posted to the Pending Transactions
list. If, for any reason, the transaction is interrupted before
it is complete, the information contained in the Pending Transactions
list can be used to undo any monetary exchange that has taken
place. This protects the user from any damages that might result
from accidental computer failure. It also helps prevent a malicious
applet from making unauthorized charges by faking a failure of
some kind.
<H4>Creating a Problem-Reporting System</H4>
<P>
Despite all of the measures the Java Wallet takes to prevent a
dispute from arising from an erroneous transaction, these are
still possible. For instance, if a transaction is interrupted
en route to the vendor, but is still transmitted by the payment
Cassette to a credit card company, a user might wind up paying
for a product they never received. Although this scenario is unlikely,
the JECF still provides a method to resolve disputes among any
combination of the buyer, seller, and cassette vendor. This functionality
is implemented in the <TT>Problem</TT>
class, which allows for convenient correspondence between any
of the three parties. This eliminates the need for tedious phone
calls, conference calls, and hard copies of correspondence. Instead,
parties use the Problem Resolution System to send Problem reports
back and forth. These can be easily responded to, and allow problem
troubleshooters to keep track of each problem separately. All
transactions are sent and received via e-mail, so problems can
be answered immediately.
<H2><A NAME="JECFAvailability"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
JECF Availability</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The JECF API is expected to be released as an &quot;alpha&quot;
test product in the last quarter of 1996. Currently, only a brief
White Paper and code outline are available, although JavaSoft
says it is reviewing the API with major commerce vendors. Many
companies have also endorsed the JECF concept, but only time will
tell which products will support it. In any event, the JECF will
definitely not be ready for full-fledged application development
until sometime in 1997, possibly even as late as 1998. Until that
time, developers and users will have to make do with existing
inferior, yet viable, solutions.

<P>
Although still a long way off, the JECF is one of the most exciting
new additions to the Java API. If adopted by the Internet, business,
and legal communities (it already has a long list of sponsors),
the JECF could one day replace, or at least enhance, the current
process of selling products and completing contracts. This is
one of the truly revolutionary ramifications of Java's development
and it promises abundant benefits. As long as it is implemented
cautiously and thoroughly, the Java Electronic Commerce Framework
could become the most significant and secure form of commerce
yet devised.
