One of the popular mechanisms in electronic commerce is the electronic
shopping cart. When you are shopping over the Web, you can select
numerous items that go into your virtual shopping cart. The shopping
cart keeps a continuous list of what you want to buy and how much
it costs. When you have finished selecting items, you simply push
a button and place your order.
<P>
One of the problems with many CGI shopping carts is that all the
shopping cart information resides on the Web server. Every time
you add an item to your cart, you have to communicate with the
Web server. If you have a slow connection, it may take you quite
a while to select the items. A Java applet is an ideal place for
a shopping cart. It can manage the items locally rather than saving
them on the Web server. When you decide that it's time to place
your order, the Java applet sends your order to the Web server.

One of the themes you have been hearing over and over again in
this book is that you should separate the application from the
user interface. In the case of the shopping cart, this guideline
still holds true. You create a simple framework for a shopping
cart and then attach a user interface to it. The first thing you
need to do is figure out how the shopping cart will work. The
cart itself is nothing fancy; it is just a container of items.
<P>
Before you start writing the shopping cart, you should spend a
little time on the items that go in the cart. You probably need
some sort of name for the item, a price, and maybe a quantity.
The quantity value is handy if you don't want to have multiple
instances of the same item in your cart. For instance, if you
are ordering tires, you can either have four separate instances
of a tire item, or have one tire item with a quantity of four.
Listing 29.1 shows a simple implementation of a shopping cart
item. It contains a name, a price, a quantity, and also an URL
that refers to a description of the item.

One interesting thing about the <TT>ShoppingCartItem</TT> class is that it cheats when it comes to object equality. It treats any two objects with the same name and cost as being equal. If they have different quantities, they are still considered equal. 
This is usually not a good idea, since it can lead to confusion, but in this particular instance, it works nicely. If you have an item with some quantity value, you can search through the cart for the same object (ignoring the quantities) and if you find a 

matching object, you can just add their quantities together.

The next item on the agenda is the shopping cart itself. Since
this is a very simple model of a cart, independent of the user
interface, the cart should be observable. In other words, other
objects should be able to watch the shopping cart to see when
it changes. This allows you to write a user interface that updates
itself whenever the cart is changed, yet you keep the user interface
code out of the cart. The <TT>Observer</TT>/<TT>Observable</TT>
mechanism is very handy for this sort of thing. The shopping cart
is a subclass of the <TT>Observable</TT>
class. Whenever the cart changes, it sends a notification to its
observers. When you implement an observable object, you frequently
need to notify the observers of different types of changes. For
instance, in the shopping cart, you can add an item, remove an
item, or change the quantity of an item. Since there is only one
way to notify the observers that a change has taken place, you
need to cram all that information into a single method call. You
can accomplish this by creating an object that holds the information
about the change. Listing 29.2 shows the <TT>ShoppingCartEvent</TT>
class that holds the change information.

Now you can create the shopping cart itself. All you really need
is a vector object for storing the cart items and a variable for
the total cost so far. You must also be sure that you always notify
your observers whenever the cart changes. Another object may be
keeping a duplicate record of all the items in the cart. If you
add or remove an item from the cart without sending a notification,
the other object will no longer have an accurate representation
of the shopping cart. Listing 29.3 shows the <TT>ShoppingCart</TT>
object.

Now that you have the basic framework for a shopping cart, you
can work on a user interface for it.
<H2><A NAME="CreatingaShoppingCartUserInterface"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Creating a Shopping Cart User Interface</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The user interface for an electronic shopping cart is rarely a
simple thing. Many shopping cart interfaces are incredibly complex,
but also extremely easy to use. You can keep the interface pretty
simple and still create a useful shopping cart, however.
<P>
If you think about the structure of a shopping cart application,
you'll see that it really has two parts to it-the shopping cart
and the catalog. When you are buying items, you look through the
catalog of available items and select the ones you want. The catalog
then sends these items to the shopping cart.
<P>
At some point, you go over to the shopping cart and review what
you have selected. You may decide to put some of the items back,
in which case the shopping cart must remove them from its list
and possibly return them to the catalog. There are a number of
ways to design a system like this. One of the more interesting
ways is to create two separate applets-a catalog applet and a
shopping cart applet.<BR>
<P>

It is frequently useful to split the user interface into separate applets. Many times, you can reuse one of the applets in another project without going through the pain of separating out the other parts of the user interface.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In order to implement this system with multiple applets, you need
a way for the applets to locate each other. While applets can
use the <TT>AppletContext</TT> class
to find each other, your best bet is the <TT>AppletRegistry</TT>
class, which was introduced in <A HREF="ch10.htm" >Chapter 10</A>, &quot;Inter-Applet
Communication.&quot; The <TT>AppletRegistry</TT>
class is an observable class, which means that an applet can be
notified whenever new applets are loaded. If you don't use the
registry, you must be prepared to occasionally poll for the other
applets in case your applet starts up first.
<P>
For a simple user interface, you may decide to present a scrollable
list of items both in the catalog and in the shopping cart. Unfortunately,
the AWT <TT>List</TT> class leaves
much to be desired when it comes to scrollable lists. The biggest
problem with the <TT>List</TT> class
is that is only stores strings. Since the strings you store in
the scrollable lists are the strings the user sees, you can't
really hide any information in them. For instance, if you look
at the information stored in the <TT>ShoppingCartItem</TT>
class, you realize that you don't want the URL for the item's
description clogging up space in the list.
<P>
Listing 29.4 shows an <TT>ObjectList</TT>
class that allows you to associate an object with each entry in
a scrollable list.

You should use the <TT>ObjectList</TT> class in place of the <TT>List</TT> class in many, if not all, situations. It is important to be able to associate objects with the entries in a list, and even more important to keep the content of the list strings

The catalog interface should allow a user to browse through the
items that are for sale. You should at least provide some sort
of description. If you are selling software or online services,
it would be even better to offer a small sample. This would also
be true for music or video recordings. While Java doesn't have
the ability to display many of these kinds of media yet, that
capability is coming. For now, you can take advantage of the wonderful
infrastructure of the Web and use simple URLs to describe the
product. That way, you can include audio and video clips as you
see fit.
<P>
Since the catalog and the shopping cart are different applets,
they need some way to communicate back and forth. The <TT>ShoppingCart</TT>
class is the perfect mechanism for this. Whenever someone selects
an item from the catalog, the catalog applet adds the item to
the <TT>ShoppingCart</TT> class. The
shopping cart applet is an observer of the <TT>ShoppingCart</TT>
class and sees the new item immediately.<BR>

If you recall the Model-View-Controller paradigm, which was discussed in <A HREF="ch9.htm" >Chapter 9</A> &quot;Creating Reusable Graphics Components,&quot; the <TT>ShoppingCart</TT> class represents the model of the data. The catalog represents the 
controller, since it takes user input and translates it into changes in the model. The shopping cart applet is the view of the model, since it displays the items stored in the actual cart. The shopping cart applet also acts as a controller since it also 
takes input.

Now that most of the hard work has been done, the shopping cart
interface itself is<BR>
fairly easy. Basically, the shopping cart applet must be an observer
of the shopping cart. Whenever the applet receives an update notification
telling it that the shopping cart has changed, the applet simply
changes its local list of items, which is a scrollable list (actually,
it's an <TT>ObjectList</TT>). The
shopping cart applet is also responsible for sending the order
to the Web server. For posting data to the Web server, you can
adapt the <TT>PostSockURL</TT> or
<TT>URLPost</TT> classes from Chapter
6, &quot;Communicating with a Web Server.&quot; Listing 29.7 shows

Figure 29.1 shows the shopping cart applet in action.
<P>
<A HREF="http://docs.rinet.ru/JSol/f29-1.gif"><B>Figure 29.1 : </B><I>The shopping cart applet works in conjunction
with a catalog applet</I>.</A>
<P>
When you request a description of an item, the catalog applet
opens another browser window for viewing descriptions. Since the
descriptions are simple URLs, you can include any data that you
could normally place on a Web page. Figure 29.2 shows the description
window for the shopping cart applet.
<P>
<A HREF="http://docs.rinet.ru/JSol/f29-2.gif"><B>Figure 29.2 : </B><I>An item description can be described by
simple HTML pages</I>.</A>
<P>
In addition to providing an introduction to electronic shopping
carts, this chapter reuses several key components from previous
chapters. This makes the programs in this chapter easier to write,
and it shows that the components that were presented as being
reusable really <TT><I>are</I></TT>
reusable.
<P>
One of the upcoming additions to Java, the Java Electronic Commerce
Framework (JECF), will help you when developing shopping cart
applications. Your shopping cart will be allowed to conduct financial
transactions with the user's Java Wallet, which provides payment
via credit card access, electronic cash, and other forms of electronic
transactions. <A HREF="ch31.htm" >Chapter 31</A>, &quot;Java Electronic Commerce Framework
(JECF),&quot; provides an overview of the services provided by
the JECF.
<P>
Finally, remember to use secure communications when performing
any transactions that involve personal information such as credit
card numbers or social security numbers. It is a good idea to
provide secure access at all times, because some customers will
want all aspects of a transaction to be hidden from prying eyes.
