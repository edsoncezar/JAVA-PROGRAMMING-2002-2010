IBM's Customer Information Control System (CICS) is an extremely
popular transaction processing system. Sites all over the world
use CICS for ordering, inventory, accounting, and almost any other
business application you can think of. While CICS itself is still
a very active operating system, it can be considered a &quot;legacy&quot;
system with respect to the Internet.
<P>
IBM, realizing the potential of the Internet, has taken huge strides
in opening up their products to the Internet. They have created
gateways for the AS/400 line of computers and have been pushing
them as Web servers. There is also a TCP/IP gateway available
for MVS systems, which has been a boon to many MVS shops.
<P>
In the area of CICS, IBM has created a CICS Web gateway that allows
you to create CGI scripts that make calls into CICS. Rather than
just stick with that, however, IBM took a major step forward and
created the Java-CICS gateway. The Java-CICS gateway allows a
Java applet or application to send requests to a CICS system and
receive responses. This gateway sits between the CICS system and
your Java programs and translates TCP/IP requests from the Java
side into SNA or TCP/IP requests on the CICS side. Figure 34.1
shows the relationship between the Java-CICS gateway, a CICS system,
and your Java program.

<P>
CICS is a transaction-processing system that performs a number
of very handy functions. First and foremost, it manages multiple
simultaneous transactions, some of which may be distributed across
multiple machines.
<P>
The main focus of CICS is processing transactions. You group operations
in a transaction into Logical Units of Work (LUW). You can have
multiple LUWs in a single transaction. For instance, booking a
seat on an airplane would be considered an LUW. Your entire reservation
is a transaction, made up of one or more LUWs (after all, you
are probably booking seats on multiple flights).
<P>
Like other transaction systems, CICS has the ability to abort
or &quot;roll back&quot; a transaction. For instance, when you
book a seat on an airplane, you want that booking to be visible
immediately. If you get the last seat on a plane, you don't want
someone else booking that same seat. If you suddenly decide that
you don't want to fly at all, the friendly airline agent helping
you build the reservation would then abort the transaction. The
CICS system would undo all your seat bookings. This kind of feature
is usually associated only with database systems, but CICS is
not a database system. You still need a database system to use
CICS-either IBM's DB2 database or a variety of popular relational
databases.
<P>
CICS started out back before personal computers hit the scene,
so it is well-versed in communicating with older &quot;legacy&quot;
terminals like the IBM 3270 series. IBM has done a good job in
keeping CICS up-to-date with clients, and today it supports clients
on a large number of platforms, including Windows NT, OS/2, and
various flavors of UNIX. CICS didn't remain stuck in the &quot;character
mode&quot; frame of mind, either. You can buy automated tools
for building Graphical User Interfaces for CICS.
<P>
CICS also has the ability to communicate with a variety of clients,
and even other CICS servers. It supports the popular TCP/IP protocol,
as well as IBM's proprietary SNA protocol and even NetBIOS.
<P>
For more information about CICS, visit the CICS home page on the
Web at <TT><B><A HREF="http://www.hursley.ibm.com/cics/">http://www.hursley.ibm.com/cics/</A></B></TT>.
<H2><A NAME="TheCICSExternalCallInterface"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
The CICS External Call Interface</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The External Call Interface (ECI) is a mechanism used by CICS
to allow non-CICS clients to invoke programs under CICS. CICS
has a remote procedure call mechanism called DPL (Distributed
Program Link) which allows a CICS program to start up a CICS program
on another CICS host. ECI works exactly the same way as DPL, except
that the program that originates the call is not running under
CICS.
<P>
CICS applications are built as a series of programs, where one
program runs another program, which is why you can do almost anything
you need with ECI.
<P>
To run a CICS program using ECI, you must supply CICS with a user
name and password, as well as the name of the program you want
to run. You pass data to the program via a block of data called
the <TT>COMMAREA</TT> block. The contents
of the block vary from program to program. There is no fixed format
to the block. Typically, however, you pass text information in
the block. If you have to pass a numeric value, you pass numbers
as a text string.
<P>
You must also pass information about the LUW for your transaction.
A unit of work can span multiple ECI calls, if it needs to. An
LUW is similar to a transaction in a relational database. As you
make changes over the course of an LUW, the changes are not visible
to the rest of the system until you commit the LUW, that is, until
you save it. If there is a failure of some kind, CICS will undo
the changes made so far in the current LUW, but not the previous
LUWs.
<P>
When you make an ECI call, you pass an LUW token, which is like
a session ID for the LUW. When you start a new LUW, you pass a
token called <TT>ECU_LUW_NEW</TT>.
CICS will then generate an LUW token value for subsequent ECI
calls for this LUW. You must also pass an extend mode parameter
for the LUW. You pass either a value of <TT>ECI_EXTENDED</TT>
or <TT>ECI_NO_EXTEND</TT>. It's very
easy to determine when to use <TT>ECI_EXTENDED</TT>
and when to use <TT>ECI_NO_EXTEND</TT>.
You use <TT>ECI_NO_EXTEND</TT> on
the last ECI call in an LUW, and <TT>ECI_EXTENDED</TT>
for all others. If you have only one call in the LUW, it's both
the first and last call, so it is sent with the <TT>ECI_NO_EXTEND</TT>
parameter.
<P>
Sometimes, you realize you want to back out the LUW (undo the
changes) or commit it without actually calling another program.
You can use an extend mode of <TT>ECI_COMMIT</TT>
to commit the current LUW, or <TT>ECI_BACKOUT</TT>
to back out the changes in the current LUW.
<P>
In addition to the preceding parameters, which are part of the
regular ECI interface, you must pass an additional parameter to
the Java-CICS gateway. You must supply the name of the CICS server
you want to talk to, because the gateway can talk to many different
servers.
<H2><A NAME="TheJavaCICSGatewayAPI"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
The Java-CICS Gateway API</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
While the ECI may seem fairly complicated to you so far, the Java
API is actually very simple. In fact, the API consists of only
two classes-the <TT>JGateConnection</TT>
class and the <TT>ECIRequest</TT>
class.
<P>
The <TT>JGateConnection</TT> class
represents a connection to a Java-CICS gateway server. You can
create multiple connections to a single server, or to different
servers. You can perform only one ECI call at a time over a single
connection. You can perform as many ECI calls as you like over
one connection, just one at a time.
<P>
The constructor for the <TT>JGateConnection</TT>
class takes two parameters-the name and port number of the gateway
server you are connecting to. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
JGateConnection cicsGateway = new JGateConnection(
&quot;gateway.myplace.com&quot;, 4321);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you have created the connection, you use the <TT>flow</TT>
method to send ECI requests to the gateway. The <TT>flow</TT>
method takes an <TT>ECIRequest</TT>
object as its only parameter. Any information returned from the
ECI call is stored in the <TT>Commarea</TT>
array in the <TT>ECIRequest</TT>.
<P>
You create an <TT>ECIRequest</TT>
by passing its constructor the name of the CICS server, the user
name, password, <TT>Commarea</TT>,
extend mode, and LUW token.
<P>
Suppose you had a CICS program called &quot;BOOKSEAT&quot; that
booked a seat on an airline flight. Furthermore, assume that the
name of the CICS server is &quot;RES,&quot; and that the user
name and password are <TT><B>airjava</B></TT>
and <TT><B>whee</B></TT>, respectively.
Also, assume that you must store a 4-digit flight number, a 5-digit
date in the form DDMMM, and a 3-letter seat number in the <TT>Commarea</TT>.
The following code segment would create the <TT>ECIRequest</TT>
to book seat 35B on flight 5050 on January 12. Also, this is a
one-shot LUW, so use an extend mode of <TT>ECI_NO_EXTEND</TT>,
and an LUW token of <TT>ECI_LUW_NEW</TT>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
byte[] commarea = new byte [12];
// A quickie to copy a string into a byte array
&quot;505012JAN35B&quot;.getBytes(0, 12, commarea, 0);
ECIRequest request = new ECIRequest(&quot;RES&quot;, &quot;airjava&quot;, &quot;whee&quot;,
     &quot;BOOKSEAT&quot;, commarea, ECI_NO_EXTEND, ECI_LUW_NEW);
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
To send this request to CICS, you use the flow method in the <TT>JGateConnection</TT>
object, like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
cicsGateway.flow(request);    // send the ECI request</FONT>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Once you send the request, you can check the CICS return code,
which is stored in the <TT>Cics_Rc</TT>
variable in the <TT>ECIRequest</TT>
object. If the request completed successfully, the <TT>Cics_Rc</TT>
value should be 0.
<H2><A NAME="CreatingMultipleCallLUWs"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Creating Multiple-Call LUWs</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The one-shot, or single-call, LUW is very simple to make, and
will probably cover most situations for you. When you do a multiple-call
LUW, there are a few extra things you have to deal with:
<UL>
<LI>On the first ECI call, you must sent an LUW token of <TT>ECI_LUW_NEW</TT>,
and the extend mode must be <TT>ECI_EXTENDED</TT>.
<LI>After the first ECI call completes, you must save the LUW
token returned by the CICS system, which is stored in the <TT>Luw_Token</TT>
variable in the <TT>ECIRequest</TT>
object. You must pass this <TT>Luw_Token</TT>
variable as the LUW token for subsequent ECI requests for this
LUW.
<LI>On the last ECI call, you must set the extend mode to <TT>ECI_NO_EXTEND</TT>.
<LI>If you want to commit or back out the current LUW, you set
the extend mode to <TT>ECI_COMMIT</TT>
or <TT>ECI_BACKOUT</TT>.
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you reuse the same ECIRequest object for each ECI call in an LUW, the <TT>Luw_Token</TT> variable will already contain the correct LUW token value. You need to change only the token value when you start a new LUW.

Suppose you want to book a round-trip flight using the BOOKSEAT
program illustrated previously. Because you want this to be a
single LUW, that is, you want to book both seats as a single transaction,
you call <TT>BOOKSEAT</TT> twice as
part of a single LUW. The following code books seat 35B on flight
5050 on January 12 and seat 12A on flight 1313 on January 13 as
a single LUW:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
byte[] commarea = new byte [12];
// A quickie to copy a string into a byte array
&quot;505012JAN35B&quot;.getBytes(0, 12, commarea, 0);
// Book the first flight leg
ECIRequest request = new ECIRequest(&quot;RES&quot;, &quot;airjava&quot;, &quot;whee&quot;,
     &quot;BOOKSEAT&quot;, commarea, ECI_EXTENDED, ECI_LUW_NEW);
cicsGateway.flow(request);     // send the ECI request
// Now copy in the return flight leg
&quot;131313JAN12A&quot;.getBytes(0, 12, commarea);
// Change the extend mode on the ECI request to ECI_NO_EXTEND
request.Extend_Mode = ECI_NO_EXTEND;
// Book the second flight leg

Be careful when creating multiple-call LUWs. If there is a significant amount of time between calls, you could keep system resources locked unnecessarily. Remember that CICS keeps certain locks on data while an LUW is in progress.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Creating Web Interfaces to CICS</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Even before IBM came out with the Java-CICS gateway, you were
able to provide Web access into CICS systems. Using a CICS TCP/IP
gateway, you could write CGI scripts that used ECI to run programs
on the CICS system. Figure 34.2 illustrates this configuration.
<P>
<A HREF="http://docs.rinet.ru/JSol/f34-2.gif"><B>Figure 34.2 : </B><I>A CICS TCP/IP gateway allows CGI programs
to make ECI calls</I>.</A>
<P>
As usual, this solution suffered from the usual problems of CGI-the
CGI program exited after each request, and you had fairly high
session-startup costs.
<P>
As you might guess, a Java Web server is an excellent alternative
to CGI when accessing CICS. You could, if you wanted, create a
servlet that talked to a CICS TCP/IP gateway, but there's no need
to do this when IBM has already created the Java-CICS gateway.
<P>
You can create Java servlets that execute CICS programs. The advantage
to the servlets is that they can use existing connections to the
CICS gateway, eliminating the session startup overhead you get
with CGI. Figure 34.3 illustrates the relationship between the
servlet, the Java-CICS gateway, and the CICS system.
<P>
<A HREF="http://docs.rinet.ru/JSol/f34-3.gif"><B>Figure 34.3 : </B><I>The Java servlet relating to the Java-CICS
gateway and the CICS system</I>.</A>
<P>
You can use the techniques outlined in <A HREF="ch33.htm" >Chapter 33</A>, &quot;Web-Enabling
Legacy Systems,&quot; to preserve session information, so you
can perform multiple-call LUWs via Web requests.
<P>
Recall that in <A HREF="ch33.htm" >Chapter 33</A>, you created a session ID variable that
was used as a lookup value for the session-related information.
In the CICS case, the session components you are concerned with
are the <TT>JGateConnection</TT> and
the <TT>Luw_Target</TT> for the LUW.
Using these two values, you can create an ECI request for an existing
LUW. The following class saves the information for the session:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
public class LUWSession
     public JGateConnection connection;
     public int LUWTarget;
     public LUWSession(JGateConnection connection,
          int LUWTarget)
     {
          this.connection = connection;
          this.LUWTarget = LUWTarget;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="ProvidingaCORBAInterfacetoCICS"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>
Providing a CORBA Interface to CICS</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
It would be really nice if there were a standard CORBA interface
into CICS, but in the meantime, you can provide your own CORBA
access to CICS in a variety of ways.
<H3><A NAME="CreatingaCORBACICSGateway">
Creating a CORBA-CICS Gateway</A></H3>
<P>
You may want to use the Java-CICS gateway from a number of CORBA
clients, maybe even non-Java clients. One way you can do this
is to define an IDL interface that mimics the ECI interface. The
following IDL definition creates one such interface:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
module CICS {
// Define the different values for the extend mode
     enum ExtendType {
          ECI_NO_EXTEND,
          ECI_EXTENDED,
          ECI_BACKOUT,
          ECI_COMMIT
     };
// Define the constant for a new LUW token
     const long ECI_LUW_NEW = 0;
// Set up a data type for the commarea
     typedef sequence&lt;octet&gt; byteArray;
     interface ECI {
// Define the flow method that will send calls to CICS
          void flow(in string serverName, in string programName,
               in string userName, in string password,
               inout byteArray commarea,
               in long extendMode, inout long luwToken);
     };
};
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The preceding interface should look very familiar because it is
the same as the Java-CICS gateway API. It simply wraps a CORBA
framework around the old API. You still have to do the work of
implementing the CORBA server, but all it would do is create an
ECI request, pass it to a <TT>JGateConnection</TT>
object, and update the <TT>luwToken</TT>
value. This is not necessarily the best way to create a CORBA
interface to CICS, however. Figure 34.4 illustrates how this CORBA-CICS
gateway fits in with the client, the Java-CICS gateway, and the
CICS system.
<P>
<A HREF="http://docs.rinet.ru/JSol/f34-4.gif"><B>Figure 34.4 : </B><I>A CORBA-CICS gateway uses the Java-CICS
gateway to make ECI calls</I>.</A>
<P>
The reason you probably want to avoid setting things up this way
is that you don't want to carry the CICS-specific features into
your future versions. In other words, an interface like this is
one of those cases where the remnants of a legacy system can stay
embedded in your application long after the legacy system has
departed. For example, suppose you write all your applications
to use this ECI interface over CORBA. You're now passing all sorts
of different requests using the same method call. The only difference
between the requests is the program name and the contents of the
<TT>Commarea</TT>.
<P>
Now, suppose you replace your CICS system with a newer one. If
you don't want to replace all your existing applications, you
have to create an encapsulation that maps the program name and
<TT>Commarea</TT> information to whatever
the new system needs. Someone looking at an application cannot
determine what a particular ECI call does without knowing what
the CICS program did.
<H3><A NAME="CreatingCORBAInterfacestoCICSPrograms">
Creating CORBA Interfaces to CICS Programs</A></H3>
<P>
Following the encapsulation principles from <A HREF="ch32.htm" >Chapter 32</A>, look at
the CICS system as an application or group of applications to
see what it actually does. For example, the BOOKSEAT program from
earlier in this chapter can be represented by the following IDL
interface:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
module Reservations {
     struct Date {
          short year;
          short month;
          short day;
     };
     interface Booking {
          void bookSeat(in short flightNumber,
               in Date date, in string seat);
     };
};
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Your CORBA server for this interface would invoke the BOOKSEAT
program in the CICS system. Unlike the previous CORBA interface,
this one is not tied to the CICS system. Remember that the dates
in the CICS reservations system were specified in DDMMM format,
like 04JUL or 25DEC. Because other systems may not use a notation
like that, the CORBA Reservations module defines a generic date
class that the CORBA server can then convert into whatever format
it needs to.
