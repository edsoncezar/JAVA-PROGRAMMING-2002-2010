<p><b>2. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE.</b>

reimburse Borland for all attorney’s fees, expenses and court costs incurred
by Borland in enforcing its rights under this paragraph.</b>
<p><b>2.2 Multiple Licensed Copies. You may purchase from Borland or its
authorized reseller the right to make multiple copies of the Product (each,
a "Licensed Copy) or the right to permit multiple Named Users to use a
Licensed Copy. Such rights will be effective only when granted in writing

of the applicable fees. If you purchase the right to make multiple Licensed
Copies, you are granted, for each Licensed Copy, the personal, nonexclusive,
nontransferable and limited license to install and execute the Licensed
Copy on one (1) computer solely as permitted under Section 2.1, subject
to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you purchase the
right to permit multiple Named Users to use a Licensed Copy then you are
granted for such Licensed Copy, the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable
and limited license to install and execute the Licensed Copy on one (1)
computer solely as permitted under Section 2.1 exclusively for use by such
number of Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. You agree that you will not install or execute the Product on
more computers than the number Licensed Copies that Borland or its authorized
reseller has expressly permitted you to make and you will not allow the
Product to be used by more users than the number of Named Users that Borland
or its authorized reseller has expressly permitted to use each Licensed
Copy.</b>
<p><b>2.3 Competitive Product Restrictions. You may not include the Product
or any component thereof, including any Redistributables (as defined in
Section 3) in any general-purpose software development tool, library, component,
or any other product that is generally competitive with or a substitute
for the Product or any other Borland product offerings; nor may you use
the Product to create a product or operate a service that is generally
competitive with the Product or any other Borland product offerings, including
any general-purpose software development tool. The foregoing restriction
does not apply, however, to your use of the Product to develop "plug-ins"
(i.e., integrations created using the Product’s open tools API) so long
as such plug-ins are designed to provide supplementary functionality to
the Product.</b>
<p><b>3. GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO COMPILED PROGRAMS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES.</b>
<p><b>3.1 Redistributables. The Product may include certain files, libraries
and/or source code specifically designated as "redistributables" by Borland
in the accompanying printed or on-line documentation and that are necessary
to use Works created using the Product ("Redistributables"). From time
to time, Borland may designate other files as Redistributables. You should
refer to the documentation, including any "readme" or "deploy" files provided
with the Product, for additional information regarding Redistributables.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you may freely redistribute
source code or compiled code that is entirely your own and does not contain
any Redistributables.</b>
<p><b>3.2 Licensing of Redistributables. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this License including the restrictions of Section 3.3, Borland grants
you the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and limited license to:
(a) make exact copies of the Redistributables and distribute those copies
solely as components of your Works and solely as required for permitting
end users of the Works ("End Users") to install and execute the Works;
(b) install and execute Redistributables, without modification, on computers
that you own or possess solely for your own internal use; and (c) sublicense
to your End Users the personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to
install and execute Redistributables, without modification, solely as components
of Works and solely for such End Users’ own internal use, subject to End
Users’ compliance with the restrictions in Section 5 as to Redistributables.
The rights granted to you under this Section 3.2 may not be exercised by
others, including co-developers, regardless of how you might compile, link,
or package your Works. These rights apply only to Redistributables and
to no other file, library, source code or other component or derivative
work of the Product. They may be exercised only with respect to Works created
by you using a duly licensed, properly registered copy of the Product.</b>
<p><b>3.3 Certain Restrictions. Regardless of any modifications that you
make and regardless of how you might compile, link, or package your Works:
(a) you may not permit your End Users to modify or further distribute Redistributables
or use Redistributables in any program that they create; (b) you may not
use Borland's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market
your Works, except to state descriptively that your Work was written using
the Product; (c) you may not incorporate or distribute a Redistributable
with a Work or other program that is capable of functioning as a general
purpose development tool, library, or component, or is otherwise generally
competitive with or a substitute for the Product or the Redistributable
itself; (d) all copies of the Works you create must bear a valid copyright
notice, either your own or the Borland copyright notice that appears on
the Product, and you may not remove or alter any Borland copyright, trademark
or other proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of the Redistributables;
and (e) you may only distribute Redistributables with Works that add primary
and substantial functionality to the Redistributables and are not merely
a set or subset of any of the Redistributables, and that are created in
accordance with the terms of this License.</b>
<p><b>3.4 Relationship with End Users. Except as set forth in Section 4,
there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Consequently,
Borland provides no warranty at all to any person, other than the limited
warranty provided to you the original purchaser of the Product, as set
forth herein, and you will be solely responsible to your End Users (or
anyone else who uses or acquires Works) for support, service, upgrades,
or technical or other assistance (including with respect to any Redistributables
included therein), and such persons will have no right to contact Borland
for any services or assistance. You will indemnify, defend and hold Borland,
its licensors, its suppliers and each of their respective employees, officers,
directors and affiliates, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities
arising out of or related to the use, procurement, reproduction or distribution
of your Works by third parties.</b>
<p><b>3.5 Third Party Software. The Product, including Redistributables,
may include source code, redistributable files, and/or other files provided
by a third party vendor ("Third Party Product"). Since use of Third Party
Product might be subject to license restrictions imposed by the third party
vendor, you should refer to the on-line documentation (if any) provided
with Third Party Product for any license restrictions imposed by the third
party vendor. In any event, any license restrictions imposed by a third
party vendor are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions
of this License.</b>
<p><b>3.6 Other Rights. Contact Borland for the applicable royalties due
and other licensing terms for all other uses or distribution of the Redistributables.</b>
<p><b>4. SPECIAL TERMS.</b>
<p><b>The following terms and conditions ("Special Terms") are specific
to certain editions, versions and components of the Product and are in
addition to the provisions of Sections 2 and 3. If any provision of the
Special Terms applicable to the Product conflicts with any other provision
of this License, then the provision of the Special Terms will supercede
and control.</b>

terms which are on the media containing the Accompanying Products and which

<p><b>ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR JDATASTORE</b>
<p><b>The portion of the Product identified as JDATASTORE (if any) is not
a Redistributable. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
you may only use JDATASTORE under this License to develop, compile and
test Works and for no other purpose. You must purchase a separate JDATASTORE
deployment license from Borland or an authorized reseller for each copy
of any Work that you deploy if the Work incorporates, or requires use of,
JDATASTORE or includes the file "jdslicense.jar." You are not permitted
to reproduce JDATASTORE for sublicensing, resale, lending, leasing, deployment
or distribution to any party, including without limitation, distributing
JDATASTORE as part of a VAR, OEM, distributor or reseller arrangement.
If you integrate JDATASTORE or the file "jdslicense.jar" into a Work and
intend to distribute or resell the resulting integrated Work, you must
contact Borland to obtain the appropriate distribution license.</b>
<p><b>The following two types of JDATASTORE deployment licenses are available
from Borland:</b>
<p><b>(a) "Local Server License." When you purchase a Local Server License
with respect to a particular licensed Work, Borland grants you a personal,
nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to install and execute
JDATASTORE on one (1) computer ("Local Server") solely for your own internal
data processing purposes to provide a limited number of local support connections.
A "local support connection" is a communication session between JDATASTORE,
as resident on the Local Server, and a copy of the licensed Work that is
also executing on the Local Server and that is used solely for your internal
data processing needs. For more information on the number of local support
connections accessible under a Local Server License you should contact
Borland directly.</b>
<p><b>(b) "Unlimited Server License." When you purchase an Unlimited Server
License with respect to a particular Work, Borland grants you a personal,
nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to install and execute
JDATASTORE on one (1) computer ("Unlimited Server") solely for your own
internal data processing purposes to provide an unlimited number of support
connections. A "support connection" is a communication session between
JDATASTORE, as resident on the Unlimited Server, and a copy of the licensed
Work that is executing either on the Unlimited Server or on a remote machine.
You may not, under an Unlimited Server License, install or execute JDATASTORE
on more than one (1) computer. An Unlimited Server License for JDATASTORE
is also granted with each Deployment License purchased for Borland Enterprise
Server Web Edition.</b>
<p><b>4.4 SPECIAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO JBUILDER 6.0 PROFESSIONAL ONLY</b>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR JDATASTORE AND COMPONENTS</b>
<p><b>The Product may be accompanied by another Borland software product
identified as JDATASTORE (including the file "jdslicense.jar"). JDATASTORE
does not constitute a part of the Product. JDATASTORE is subject to separate
license terms which are on the media containing JDATASTORE and which may
be viewed and accepted at the time JDATASTORE is installed. You have no
rights under this License to use JDATASTORE, and your use of JDATASTORE
may require you to purchase separate licenses and obtain separate License
Key Certificates directly from Borland.</b>
<p><b>4.5 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO EVALUATION SOFTWARE</b>
<p><b>You may not use the Product for any commercial, business, governmental
or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period,
further use of the Product by you is prohibited without the purchase of
a commercial license. If you do not purchase a license for the Product
at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently remove
or delete the Product from all computer systems on which it was installed
and destroy any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall
a new copy of the Product. If you desire to continue to use the Product
following the Evaluation Period, you should contact Borland or a Borland
authorized reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product.</b>
<p><b>4.6 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO SOFTWARE LICENSED FOR
EDUCATIONAL USE</b>
<p><b>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may exercise
your rights under this license to use the Product and to create Works solely
for your own personal use in providing or receiving instruction within
the limited scope of guided computer programming and/or software training
courses in which you are a direct and personal participant, either as student

or Works created with the products for any commercial, business, governmental
or institutional purpose of any kind, except to the extent you are an instructor
teaching a Course. You may also make one (1) backup copy of the Product
solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy
is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein
are retained by Borland.</b>
<p><b>4.7 ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE</b>

("Sitraka Software"). The Sitraka Software consists of the components identified
in the JBuilder Component Palette as"JClass". Notwithstanding any provision
in this License to the contrary, you may only use the Sitraka Software

test, use or distribute any Works that incorporate, or require the use
of, the Sitraka Software unless you first purchase a license to do so from
Sitraka Software, Inc.</b>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR /N SOFTWARE</b>
<p><b>The Product includes Third Party Software provided by /N Software,
Inc. ("/n Software"). The /n Software consists of the files identified

<p><b>5. Limitations. You may not: (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate,

software other than as described in the Product’s accompanying documentation

or benefit of third parties; (g) reproduce or use the Product except as
expressly authorized under Sections 2, 3 or 4; or (h) disclose or publish
performance benchmark results for the Product. The rights granted under
this License apply only to this Product. You must procure a separate license
to use other Borland software. Furthermore, you may not permit your End
Users to conduct the restricted activities limited by items (a) through
(e), (g) and (h) above insofar as they apply to Redistributables, and such
End User’s sublicense rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon
compliance with such limitations. The limitations in this Section 5 apply
equally to your use of the Product, in whole or in part, including any
component or Redistributable.</b>
<p><b>6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. Borland warrants to you, the
original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media included
with the Product, as and when provided to you, will be free of physical
defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days after
the date that you initially acquire the Product. Your exclusive remedy
and Borland's sole liability for breach of this warranty is that Borland
will replace any defective media returned to Borland within the ninety
(90) day warranty period. This warranty does not apply to damages resulting
from misuse, abuse or neglect. Any replacement media will be warranted
as above for the remainder of the original warranty period or twenty (20)
days from the date we ship it to you, whichever is longer. EXCEPT FOR THIS
EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND. BORLAND HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS
OR QUIET ENJOYMENT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE
OR WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE
RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT. TO THE EXTENT THAT BORLAND MAY NOT
DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION
OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.</b>
<p><b>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO
THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU
SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH
VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</b>
<p><b>7. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES. Borland is not required under
this License to provide any installation, training or other services to
you. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately. If, pursuant
to a separate support agreement or otherwise, Borland provides you with
a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification
to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and
subject to the terms of this License, unless the modification is expressly
provided subject to a separate license agreement. Borland reserves the
right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product
and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions,
licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics
of any future releases of the Product.</b>
<p><b>8. Registration. You must register the Product with Borland as a
condition to your rights to use the Product. You will be prompted to register
the Product at the time of your installation or first use of the Product,
at which time you will be notified (or directed to online resources explaining)
how registration information provided by you may be used and you will be
afforded the opportunity to opt out of certain uses of such information.</b>
<p><b>9. Confidentiality. The Product (including its underlying source
code) and the terms of this License contain confidential information of
Borland. You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose
it to any person (other than your employees and individual contractors
who use the Product and who have agreed to keep confidential any of Borland’s
confidential information that you provide to them), and not use it for
any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted
under this License. These restrictions do not apply to any information
which is or becomes (through no fault of yours) publicly available. If
you are required by law or order of a court or other government authority
to disclose Borland’s confidential information, then you will immediately
notify Borland as soon as possible, but in any event prior to the disclosure,
and will cooperate with Borland, at its expense and request, in any lawful
action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.</b>
<p><b>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL BORLAND BE LIABLE TO
ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF BORLAND KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BORLAND’S TOTAL
CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY
PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE. THIS SECTION 10 WILL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY HEREUNDER HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</b>
<p><b>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT
APPLY TO YOU.</b>
<p><b>11. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. Borland will defend and settle any suit brought
against you by a third party (not your affiliate) based on a claim that
the Product infringes upon any U.S. copyright and Borland will pay those
costs and damages finally awarded against you in such suit that are specifically
attributable to such claims or those amounts payable by you under a settlement
of such suit. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on you: (a) notifying
Borland promptly in writing of such action; (b) giving Borland sole control
of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c)
cooperating and, at Borland’s request and expense, assisting in such defense.
If the Product becomes, or in Borland’s opinion is likely to become, the
subject of an infringement claim that Borland is required to defend, then
Borland may (at its option and expense) either: (a) procure for you the
right to continue using the Product; (b) replace or modify the Product
so that it becomes non-infringing; or (c) terminate this License and your
rights hereunder to use the Product and refund a pro rata portion of any
license fee you paid under this License, based on a three (3) year product
life. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borland will have no obligation under
this Section 11 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based
upon: (a) any use of the Product not in accordance with this License or
the products accompanying documentation: (b) any use of the Product in
combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not provided
by Borland; (c) any use of any version of the Product other than the most
current version made available to you; or (d) any modification of the Product
by any person other than Borland or its authorized agents ("Excluded Claims").
You will indemnify Borland against all liability, damages and costs (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees) resulting from or related to an Excluded Claim.
This section 11 states Borland’s entire liability and your sole and exclusive
remedy for third-party claims relating to the Product.</b>
<p><b>12. Audit. During the term of this License and for one (1) year thereafter,
upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, Borland or its
outside auditors will have the right to enter your premises and access
your records and computer systems to verify that you have paid to Borland
the correct amounts owed under this License and determine whether the Products
are being used in accordance with the terms of this License. You will provide
reasonable assistance to Borland in connection with this provision. You
agree to pay the cost of the audit if any underpayments during the period
covered by the audit amount to more than five percent (5%) of the fees
actually owed for that period.</b>
<p><b>13. TERM AND TERMINATION.</b>
<p><b>13.1 Term. The term of this License will begin as of the date that
you receive the Product and will remain in effect perpetually unless terminated
under this Section 13.</b>
<p><b>13.2 Termination for Convenience. You may terminate this License
for any reason, or for no reason, by giving Borland five (5) days’ written
notice.</b>
<p><b>13.3 Termination for Cause. Borland may terminate this License if
you breach your obligations hereunder. Borland will effect such termination
by giving you notice of termination, specifying therein the alleged breach.
If your breach is curable, you will have a grace period of thirty (30)
days after such notice is served to cure the breach described therein.
If the breach is cured within the thirty (30) day grace period, then this
License will remain in effect; otherwise, this License will automatically
terminate upon the conclusion of the thirty (30) day grace period.</b>
<p><b>13.4 Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this License
for any reason the following terms shall apply: (a) all rights granted
under this License will immediately terminate and you must stop all use
of the Product and any Redistributables; (b) you must immediately pay to
Borland all fees and expenses accrued prior to the effective date of termination;
(c) you must return to Borland or destroy all copies of the Product provided
to or made by you, and will, within ten (10) days after the effective date
of termination, provide Borland with written certification that all such
copies have been returned or destroyed; (d) you must return to Borland
all of its other confidential information that you have received during
the term of this License; and (e) all provisions of this Agreement with
the exception of the licenses granted in Sections 2, 3 and 4, will survive
