<P>
Java is a new and powerful language that provides many useful
features to the software developer. However, if your software
organization is typical of most, you will have to trade off moving
to Java with the constraints imposed by dependencies on in-place
legacy code. This appendix summarizes the pros and cons of moving
existing legacy code to Java. It identifies a spectrum of approaches
to accomplishing software transition and discusses the issues
involved with each approach. It also covers approaches to translating
C and C++ code to Java. This appendix assumes that the transition
of C/C++ code to Java is being performed by a moderately large
software organization. Some of the software porting issues become
insignificant if only a few small programs are translated into
Java.
<P>
<A NAME="WhyMovetoJava"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Why Move
to Java?</FONT></B></A>
<P>
When deciding whether to move existing applications to Java, a
tradeoff between the advantages and disadvantages of such a move
must be considered. This section identifies many of the advantages
of Java programs over C- and C++-based applications. The following
section considers some disadvantages of using Java and roadblocks
to any software transition effort.
<H3><A NAME="PlatformIndependence"><B>Platform Independence</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
One of the most compelling reasons to move to Java is its platform
independence. Java runs on most major hardware and software platforms,
including Windows 95 and NT, the Macintosh, and several varieties
of UNIX. Java applets are supported by all Java-compatible browsers.
By moving existing software to Java, you are able to make it instantly
compatible with these software platforms. Your programs become
more portable. Any hardware and operating system dependencies
are removed.
<P>
Although C and C++ are supported on all platforms that support
Java, these languages are not supported in a platform-independent
manner. C and C++ applications that are implemented on one operating
system platform are usually severely intertwined with the native
windowing system and OS-specific networking capabilities. Moving
between OS platforms requires recompilation, as a minimum, and
significant redesign, in most cases.
<H3><A NAME="ObjectOrientation"><B>Object Orientation</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
Java is a true object-oriented language. It does not merely provide
the capability to implement object-oriented principles-it enforces
these principles. You can develop object-oriented programs in
C++, but you are not required to do so-you can use C++ to write
C programs as well. Java does not allow you to slip outside the
object-oriented framework. You either adhere to Java's object-oriented
development approach or you do not program in Java.
<H3><A NAME="Security"><B>Security</B></A></H3>
<P>
Java is one of the first programming languages to consider security
as part of its design. The Java language, compiler, interpreter,
and runtime environment were each developed with security in mind.
The compiler, interpreter, and Java-compatible browsers all contain
several levels of security measures that are designed to reduce
the risk of security compromise, loss of data and program integrity,
and damage to system users. Considering the enormous security
problems associated with executing potentially untrusted code
in a secure manner and across multiple execution environments,
Java's security measures are far ahead of even those developed
to secure military systems. C and C++ do not have any intrinsic
security capabilities. Can you download an arbitrary untrusted
C or C++ program and execute it in a secure manner?
<H3><A NAME="Reliability"><B>Reliability</B></A></H3>
<P>
Security andreliability go hand in hand. Security measures cannot
be implemented with any degree of assurance without a reliable
framework for program execution. Java provides multiple levels
of reliability measures, beginning with the Java language itself.
Many of the features of C and C++ that are detrimental to program
reliability, such as pointers and automatic type conversion, are
avoided in Java. The Java compiler provides several levels of
additional checks to identify type mismatches and other inconsistencies.
The Java runtime system duplicates many of the checks performed
by the compiler and performs additional checks to verify that
the executable bytecodes form a valid Java program.
<H3><A NAME="Simplicity"><B>Simplicity</B></A></H3>
<P>
The Java language was designed to be a simple language to learn,
building on the syntax and many of the features of C++. However,
in order to promote security, reliability, and simplicity, Java
has left out those elements of C and C++ that contribute to errors
and program complexity. In addition, Java provides automated garbage
collection, freeing you from having to manage memory deallocation
in your programs. The end result of Java's focus on simplicity
is that it is easy to get up to speed writing Java programs for
those who have programmed in C or C++. Java programs are also
less complex than C and C++ programs due to the fact that many
of the language elements that lead to program complexity have
been removed.
<H3><A NAME="LanguageFeatures"><B>Language Features</B></A></H3>
<P>
The Java language provides many language features that make it
preferable to C or C++ for modern software development. On the
top of this list is Java's intrinsic support for multi-threading,
which is lacking in both C and C++. Other features are its exception-handling
capabilities, which were recently introduced into C++; its strict
adherence to class and object-oriented software development; and
its automated garbage-collection support. In addition to these
features, Java  enforces a common programming style by removing
the capability to slip outside the class- and object-oriented
programming paradigm to develop C-style function-oriented programs.
<H3><A NAME="Standardization"><B>Standardization</B></A></H3>
<P>
Although C and C++ have been standardized by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI), many C and C++ compilers provide custom
enhancements to the language, usually through additional preprocessor
directives. Because these enhancements usually make their way
into source code programs, a general lack of standardization results.
Java does not yet suffer from any standardization problems because
its syntax and semantics are controlled by a single organization.
<H3><A NAME="TheJavaAPI"><B>The Java API</B></A></H3>
<P>
The predefined classes of the Java API provide a comprehensive
platform-independent foundation for program development. These
classes provide the capability to develop Windows and network
programs that execute on a wide range of hosts. The Java I/O stream
classes also provide a very useful set of filters for I/O processing.
Whereas C and C++ may provide more extensive software libraries,
none of these libraries provides as much platform-independent
power as Java's API.
<H3><A NAME="TransitiontoDistributedComputing"><B>Transition to
Distributed Computing</B></A></H3>
<P>
Sun has taken important steps to support fully distributed computing
with its support of Remote Objects for Java. This product provides
the capability to develop remote interfaces between Java objects
and objects developed in other languages. The Java Interface Definition
Language (IDL) can be used to support Common Object Request Broker
Architecture (CORBA) integration.
<H3><A NAME="RapidCodeGeneration"><B>Rapid Code Generation</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
Because Java is an interpreted language, it can be used to rapidly
prototype applications that would require considerably more base
software support in languages such as C or C++. The Java API also
contributes to the capability to support rapid code generation.
The classes of the Java API provide an integrated, easy-to-use
repository for the development of application-specific software.
Because the Java API provides high-level windows and networking
support, custom application prototypes can be constructed more
quickly using these classes as a foundation.
<H3><A NAME="EaseofDocumentationandMaintenance"><B>Ease of Documentation
and Maintenance</B></A></H3>
<P>
Java software is essentially self-documenting when doc comments
and the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">javadoc</FONT></TT> tool are
used to generate software documentation. The excellent Java API
documentation is an example of the superior documentation capabilities
provided by Java. Because Java software is inherently better structured
and documented than C or C++ software, it is generally easier
to maintain. In addition, the package orientation of Java software
affords considerable modularity in software design, development,
documentation, and maintenance.
<H2><A NAME="ReasonsAgainstMovingtoJava"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Reasons
Against Moving to Java</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
Java provides many benefits that make it an attractive language
to use to develop new applications and to which to port existing
legacy code. The previous section discussed some of the advantages
of porting existing code to Java. This section identifies some
of the disadvantages of any C- or C++-to-Java migration effort.
<H3><A NAME="Compatibility"><B>Compatibility</B></A></H3>
<P>
Although Java is supported on many platforms, it is not supported
on all of them. If your target hardware or software platform does
not support Java, you are out of luck. Your alternatives are to
switch to a different platform or wait for Java to be ported to
your existing software platform.
<P>
Compatibility may also be a problem at a design level. Suppose
that your target software platform does, in fact, support Java.
If your legacy code is designed in such a manner that it is unstructured
and incompatible with a class- and object-oriented model, the
effort required to migrate the software may be prohibitive.
<H3><A NAME="Performance"><B>Performance</B></A></H3>
<P>
Java is interpreted, and although its execution is efficient,
it might not meet the performance demands of those applications
in which execution speed is of paramount importance. Examples
of these types of applications include numerical &quot;number
crunching&quot; programs, real-time control processes, language
compilers, and modeling and simulation software. Just because
your application fits into one of these categories does not necessarily
rule out Java, however. For example, the Java compiler is written
in Java and performs admirably for small programs. However, its
performance is greatly enhanced when it is compiled into native
machine code instructions. Java-to-C translators allow programs
to be developed in Java and translated into C for native machine
code compilation. The translation process generally improves the
performance of Java programs.
<H3><A NAME="Retraining"><B>Retraining</B></A></H3>
<P>
Although Java is simple, easy to learn, and based on C++, some
training may be required to get programmers up and running writing
Java code. This is especially true if the programmers have been
using C++ in a nonstructured, non-object-oriented fashion. I never
really appreciated the object-oriented programming features provided
by C++ before I began programming in Java. Until I had adopted
the Java program-development mindset, I was trying to apply my
outdated and inefficient C++ programming techniques to Java software
development. After I had made the mental transition to the Java
object-oriented programming model, I became much more comfortable
and efficient in writing Java programs.
<H3><A NAME="ImpactonExistingOperations"><B>Impact on Existing
Operations</B></A></H3>
<P>
Moving legacy code to Java may result in adverse affects on company
operations that are supported with legacy software. This is especially
true when the legacy code is implemented in a poorly structured,
convoluted manner that typically evolves from extensive software
patches and upgrades. If existing system software is tightly coupled
and fragile, a transition to Java (or any other language) may
break the software application to the point where a complete software
redevelopment is required.
<H3><A NAME="CostScheduleandLevelofEffort"><B>Cost, Schedule,
and Level of Effort</B></A></H3>
<P>
Any software transition effort is subject to cost and schedule
constraints. Moving current legacy software to Java might not
be cost-effective given the current software investment and its
expected operational life. The software transition may also have
a significant impact on system availability and previously scheduled
activities. Transition from C or C++ to Java might also require
a significant level of effort that would exceed the expected budget
for the maintenance of the legacy code.
<H2><A NAME="TransitionApproachesandIssues"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Transition
Approaches and Issues</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
There are many ways to integrate Java into existing software applications.
This section identifies some of these approaches and explores
the issues involved in transitioning to a Java-based software
environment.
<H3><A NAME="InterfacingwithExistingLegacyCod"><B>Interfacing
with Existing Legacy Cod</B></A>e</H3>
<P>
One of the easiest ways to introduce Java to an operational environment
is to use it to add functionality to existing legacy code. Java
programs do not replace existing legacy software; they merely
enhance it to support new applications. This approach involves
minimal impact to existing software, but does introduce a potentially
thorny maintenance issue with Java being added to the current
list of languages that must be used to maintain the system.
<H3><A NAME="IncrementalReimplementationofLegacyC"><B>Incremental
Reimplementation of Legacy Code</B></A></H3>
<P>
An incremental approach to reimplementing legacy code in Java
can be used to cut over to a Java-based software-development approach
while minimizing the impact on existing legacy software. This
approach assumes that the legacy software is developed in a modular
fashion and can be replaced in an incremental manner. If this
is the case, legacy software can be migrated to Java on a module-by-module
basis with the legacy code ultimately replaced by new Java software.
<H3><A NAME="OffBoardingAccesstoLegacyObjects"><B>Off-Boarding
Access to Legacy Objects</B></A></H3>
<P>
If in-place legacy code can be upgraded using Java software that
is implemented on separate hardware platforms, Java can be used
to &quot;off board&quot; many of the functions performed by the
legacy code. The use of off-board server software allows the investment
in legacy code to be preserved while expanding the services provided
by the system as a whole.
<H3><A NAME="FullScaleRedevelopment"><B>Full-Scale Redevelopment</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
In some cases, it is more cost-effective to keep legacy code in
place while completely redeveloping system software from scratch.
This is typically the case when the system is subject to large-scale
reengineering or when it is so fragile that it breaks as the result
of the simplest upgrades. Full-scale system redevelopment being
necessary is actually an advantage to Java software development
because the developed software is under no legacy compatibility
constraints and can take full advantage of Java's capabilities.
<H2><A NAME="TranslationApproachesandIssues"><B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Translation
Approaches and Issues</FONT></B></A></H2>
<P>
Translation of existing C and C++ code into Java can be performed
in several different ways, depending on the compatibility of the
existing software with Java. This section describes some of the
different approaches to software translation.
<H3><A NAME="AutomatedTranslation"><B>Automated Translation</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
Tools and utilities have been developed that allow Java source
and bytecode to be translated into C to support native machine
code compilation. Future Java-integrated software-development
environments are planned where either Java or C++ code may be
generated based on the configuration of the development software.
These development tools will allow easy movement between C++ and
Java. These tools require a common set of libraries that can be
used by either Java or C++ programs. Automated translation between
these two languages will be supported to some extent.
<P>
The degree to which C++ programs may be automatically translated
into Java will depend on the planning and effort put into the
code's design to develop it in a way that makes it more amenable
to automated translation. Factors to be considered include the
use of compatible libraries, the use of single inheritance, the
use of object-oriented programming capabilities, and minimization
of the use of incompatible language features.
<H3><A NAME="ManualTranslation"><B>Manual Translation</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
Manual translation of C and C++ to Java will probably be the most
common approach to moving C and C++ legacy programs to Java. This
approach requires you to use two editor windows-one for the legacy
C++ code being translated and the other for the Java program being
created. Some of the translation is accomplished by cutting and
pasting C++ statements into the Java window, making the corrections
necessary to adjust for language differences. Other parts of the
translation require that new Java classes, interfaces, variables,
and methods be developed to implement C++ functions and data structures
that cannot be directly translated from C++ to Java. The effectiveness
of the manual translation process will be determined by the degree
to which the C++ legacy code meets the compatibility considerations
identified at the end of the previous section.
<H3><A NAME="SourceLevelRedesign"><B>Source-Level Redesign</B></A>
</H3>
<P>
In many cases, manual translation may be hampered by the fact
that the C++ legacy code might be written in a style that renders
it impossible to migrate using cut-and-paste-based translation
methods. In these cases, a class- and object-oriented design of
the legacy code needs to be extracted from the legacy code and
used as the basis for the Java source code development. A two-level
approach to software translation is followed. The legacy code
is reverse-engineered to an object-oriented design, and the recovered
design information is used to develop a Java software design which
is, in turn, translated into Java source code. Code is not translated
from one language to another. Instead, legacy code is translated
into general design information that is used to drive the Java
design and implementation.
