# This program extracts email messages from a
# Lotus Notes account. 
#
# Email messages will be saved in directories
# named for the mail folder they're stored in.  
# All of these directories will be stored
# under a new top-level directory named
# "C:\temp\mail" by default, but this can be
# overridden with the -d flag.
#
# For each email message, a subdirectory will 
# be created, containing the text and attachments 
# for that message. These subdirectories are 
# currently named by sequential numbers instead of 
# by their subject titles. That's on my TODO list
# to fix; it shouldn't be too hard.
#
# Some folders in the Notes mail database are not
# really mail folders, so I try to skip them.
# Currently I skip all folders whose names are in
# parentheses (except for Inbox), and the folders 
# in the array @badlist. You can customize @badlist
# as necessary.
# 
# By default, Lotus Notes will open the email
# database for the PC's default user. To access
# the email for a different user: open Notes
# and switch to another userid first; then run
# this program while Notes is still open.
