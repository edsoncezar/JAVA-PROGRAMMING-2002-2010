      rscrsc executes a (Perl!-)Script on another host. Neither this target 
      script,
      nor rsc or parts of it, nor input or output files have to be located
      on the target machine.
      There's no need to prepare the target system in any special way. No 
special
      deamon has to run there, only perl 5.005 or higher with a few modules 
      installed
      and an rsh deamon are required. Additionally, this remote perl 
      installation needs
      installations of t...
      tunnel.pl-20000330This script is building a TCP/IP tunnel between two 
      ports. In other
      words, it makes you think that a server is listening on your local
      machine, port <num>, which is really sitting on host <tohost>, port
      <tonum>.
      The main purpose of the script is the debugging of client/server
      applications, as it includes the ability to log what the client
      sends. This is done by using the option --dir=<dir>: If this option
      is present, then any new c...

      sms-1.00This is a Perl/Tk tool for sending SMS messages. The application 
      uses the SMS
      gateway at www.genie.co.uk to do the sending. This is achieved using the
      Net::SMS::Genie module.
      This application has been tested under Solaris, Linux and Windows98 
      (running
      the binary distribution of SiePerl available from CPAN). It should run
      un-edited on any UNIX platform with Perl and the required modules 
      installed.

      dbfileutil-1-1.plExport/Import between DB_File and SDBM_File
      from Windows and Unix platforms
      SDBM_Files can be ftp'ed across Unix/Windows
      platforms and work without a hitch. (pag and

      platform. (something to do with edian)
      I like to use DB_File instead of SDBM_File
      This util will export a DB_File to SDBM_Files
      for you to ftp. Then you can import the

      ange-ftp-over-ssh.1.1-script.plNB in this readme, the script is called 
      nftp.pl. The latest version
      of this script can be obtained from
      http://parallel.hpc.unsw.edu.au/rks/ange-ftp-over-ssh.html .
      Prerequisites 
      You should have GNU Emacs and ssh installed, which you probably have
      already. You will also need Perl 5 installed. Then you need to
      download the nftp client software, written in perl. This software has
      only been tested on Unix platforms, but may well r...
      sperl-1.00sperl is some kind of enhanced perl that lets you work in a

      tunnel-auth-03.pltunnel-auth.pl - traverse a HTTP proxy via SSL Connect 
      with Basic or
      Digest authentication.
      This script can be used to traverse a HTTP proxy that supports the 
      CONNECT command as is done for SSL. It negotiates HTTP authentication,
      if necessary, then steps aside and acts as a simple port forwarder.
      It reports a User-Agent string during negotiation so that nothing
      suspicious appears in the proxy logs. Compatibility with Win32 was
