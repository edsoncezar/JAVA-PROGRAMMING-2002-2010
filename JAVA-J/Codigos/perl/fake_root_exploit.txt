I was digging through this old shell account I've had
 since I was 12 and came across this little perl code I
 wrote to fool a friend into thinking he rooted one of my
 boxes.  As you can tell, he wasn't too swift with Linux
 yet, because this code exploits /dev/null ... =)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
print "Trying to exploit hole in /dev/null..\n";
print "HOLE EXPLOITED, RETURNED 0!\n# ";
$repeat = 1;
 while($repeat eq 1) {
         $command = <>
         chop($command);
         if ($command =~ /whoami/) {print "root\n"}; 
         if ($command =~ /id/) {print "uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\n"};
         if ($command !~ /whoami/ && $command !~ /id/) { system($command) };
         print "# ";
}
