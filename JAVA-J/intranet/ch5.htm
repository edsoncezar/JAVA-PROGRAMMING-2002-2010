<P>
You might think that there is little reason to be concerned about
security in an intranet. After all, by definition an intranet
is <I>internal</I> to your organization; outsiders can't access
it. There are strong arguments for the position that an intranet
should be completely open to its users, with little or no security.
You might not have considered your intranet in any other light.
<P>
On the other hand, implementing some simple, built-in security
measures in your intranet can allow you to provide resources you
might not have considered possible in such a context. For example,
you can give access to some Web pages to some people without making
them available to your entire customer base, with several kinds
of authentication. In this chapter, you'll learn how simple security
measures can be used to widen the scope of your intranet.
<P>
To help you get oriented to the material to be presented, the
following is a list of chapter objectives. You might want to refer
to this list as you work your way through the chapter. In this
chapter, you'll

Intranet security is, then, a multifaceted issue, with both opportunities
and dangers, especially if your network is part of the Internet.
I'll walk through the major ones, with detailed information on
using built-in intranet security features, in this chapter.<BR>

Except in the sections of this chapter that are specifically devoted to Internet security issues, it's assumed that your intranet is <I>not</I> accessible from outside your organization. If you are on the Internet, the intranet security measures discussed in this chapter may not be sufficient to secure your system. If you want to make the services and resources of your intranet accessible from the outside, you'll need to take significant additional steps to prevent abuse and unauthorized access. Some of these steps are described at the end of this chapter in the section titled &quot;Your Intranet and the Internet.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="WhySecurity"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Why Security?</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
Many people view computer and network security in a negative light,
thinking of it only in terms of restricting access to services.
One major view of network security is &quot;that which is not
expressly permitted is denied.&quot; Although this view is a good
way of thinking about how to connect your organization to the
Internet, you can, and possibly should, view intranet security
from a more positive angle. Properly set up, intranet security
can be an <I>enabler</I>, enriching your intranet with services
and resources you would not otherwise be able to provide. Such
an overall security policy might be described as &quot;that which
is not expressly denied is permitted.&quot;
<P>
This does not mean that you should throw caution to the wind and
make everything available to your users on your intranet. There
are many things to consider when placing sensitive business data
out on your intranet. It may fall into the wrong hands, or worse,
be used against your business.
<P>
This chapter takes the latter approach, presenting intranet security
in terms of its opportunities for adding value to your intranet.
For example, some of your users might have information they would
like to make available, provided access to it can be limited to
a specified group-for example, confidential management or financial
information. Without the ability to ensure that only those who
have the right to see such information will have access, the custodians
of such data will not be willing to put it on your intranet. Providing
security increases your organization's ability to use the important
collaborative aspects of an intranet.
<P>
For example, your company's accounting department wants to publish
a weekly list of the top ten delinquent clients and the amounts
they owe. They've hired a young stud programmer who has created
a link to the company database that updates this information automatically.
While this information is useful to upper management, and perhaps
the sales staff, it shouldn't be viewed by other departments.
The fact that a client is delinquent in payment can cause your
employees to think less of those clients and perhaps cop a bad
attitude toward them.
<P>
The more defensive approach, preventing abuse of your intranet,
is also given play, however. Organizations' needs for security
in an intranet can vary widely. Businesses in which con-fidentiality
and discretion are the norm in handling proprietary information
and corporate intellectual property have different needs than
a college or university, for example. Academic institutions generally
tilt toward making the free exchange of ideas a primary interest.
At the same time, though, the curiosity (to use a polite word)
of undergraduates requires strong needs for security. Keeping
prying sophomores out of university administration computing resources
is a high priority; for example, students have been known to try
to access grade records (their own or those of others) for various
reasons. Even simple adolescent high jinks take on new dimensions
on a computer network.
<H3><A NAME="WhatAretheSecurityFeaturesofanInt">What Are the Security
Features of an Intranet?</A></H3>
<P>
Before going into a great deal of detail about how you can use
security to enhance your intranet, take a high-level look at what
security features are available to you. These break down into
three main categories. First, you can take steps on your Web server
to set up security. Second, you can take steps with the other
TCP/IP network services you've set up on your intranet to enhance
their security. Third, you can secure customers' Web browsers
themselves to limit what they can do with them.
<H4>Web Server Security</H4>
<P>
There is a wide range of very flexible security features you can
implement on your Web server. Here's a summary:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Access to Web servers, individual Web
pages, and entire directories containing Web pages can be set
to require a username and password.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Access to Web servers, individual Web
pages, and entire directories containing Web pages can be limited
to customers on specific computer systems. (In other words, access
will be denied unless the user is at his or her usual computer
or workstation.)</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You can organize individuals into groups
and grant access to individual Web servers, Web pages, and entire
directories containing Web pages based on group membership.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You can organize computers into groups,
and grant access to individual Web servers, Web pages, and entire
directories containing Web pages based on group membership.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>CGI-BIN scripts on your Web server can
use any of the above access restrictions, though you must take
care in writing them to ensure you don't make security-related
mistakes.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Some httpd server software is capable
of communicating with compatible Web browsers in a secure, encrypted
fashion, defeating even network-level sniffers and ensuring confidential
data transmission across your intranet.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
You can combine these features in a number of ways, such as requiring
a password and limiting access to a group of users who must access
your Web server from a specific group of computer systems. You'll
see a good deal of detail about Web server security setup in this
chapter.
<H4>Security in Other Intranet Applications</H4>
<P>
In addition to the access controls you can set up on your Web
servers, you can implement security in some of the other network
services that may be offered on your intranet. Here are some of
the steps you can take:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Access to your anonymous </FONT>FTP server
can be limited in several important ways, much like with your
HTTP server, while still enabling authorized customers to upload
files to it.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Access to your Usenet </FONT>news server
can be limited in much the same way.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Access to searchable intranet indices
and databases can be controlled through password-protected Web
interfaces.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Access to </FONT>Gopher services can be
controlled based on TCP/IP network address, and separate browse,
read, and search permissions can be set on a per-directory basis.
</UL>
<P>
This chapter, doesn't provide any additional information about
these services. You'll want to refer to the documentation for
these network packages to learn about how to handle access control
and other security features in them.
<H4>Securing Users' Web Browsers</H4>
<P>
Some Web browsers can be set up in <I>kiosk mode</I>, which limits
the features of the package that users can access. Available primarily
in NCSA Windows Mosaic and Mosaic-based browsers, kiosk mode runs
the browser with a limited set of features. Users cannot save,
print, or view the HTML source of Web pages, and hotlist/bookmark
editing is not allowed. The user cannot even exit from the browser
and restart it in normal mode without exiting from Windows altogether.
Even the overall Mosaic window cannot be minimized or maximized,
and the normal pull-down control menu for Windows is missing.
This can be quite effective in a controlled environment. However,
end users tend to find their way out of paper bags quite often.
Don't count on kiosk mode being your super security implementation.
<P>
Figure 5.1 shows NCSA Mosaic for Windows in kiosk mode, and, for
your comparison, Figure 5.2 shows the same page in standard Mosaic.
As you can see, many of the normal toolbar buttons are missing,
as is the Options menu. The remaining pull-down menus are also
limited in the available features. Kiosk mode is primarily for
use in library or trade-show environments, where users need to
be limited in what they can do, but you might find a use for it
in your intranet if you need to limit what some customers can
do with the package. The Netscape Navigator browser does not have
a kiosk mode.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Resourceful users will quickly figure out they can manually edit their PC's <TT>autoexec.bat</TT> file or Web browser's <TT>.ini</TT> file to override kiosk mode, undoing the limitations you've placed on them. If you're concerned about such things, you'll need to place user startup and Windows and browser setup files on a file server to which users have read permission only. You'll also need to limit access to the Mosaic startup command itself, or else users would simply use the Windows Program Manager's Run command to start another Mosaic session. As a result, kiosk mode might not be worth your trouble except in limited situations, such as at a trade show.

<P>
It's your responsibility to determine the level of security you
need on your intranet, and, of course, to implement it. Putting
most of the security measures mentioned into place, as you'll
learn in the following sections, is not difficult. Your primary
concern will be explaining to customers how intranet security
works, not so much as a limiting factor but as an opportunity
for increased use and collaboration using your intranet. Assuring
decision-makers that they can make information available on your
intranet in a secure fashion can go a long way toward making your
intranet a success. At the same time, it's important to make sure
both information providers and their customers understand a number
of critical aspects of intranet security, so they don't inadvertently
defeat the purpose of it.
<P>
There are network security commonplaces, unrelated to intranet
security specifically, that need your attention. All the security
precautions in the world can't protect your intranet from overall
poor security practices. Users making poor choices on passwords
always leads the list of computer and network security risks.
You can limit access to a sensitive Web resource based on the
TCP/IP network address of the boss's PC, but if the boss walks
away and leaves his PC unattended without an active screenlock,
anyone who walks into the empty office can access the protected
resources.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Password security is only as good as the passwords that are chosen. Be sure to impose some sort of password setting and changing policy. This will save you time in the end. Unique passwords that are a garble of letters and numbers are the best, but the hardest to remember. Encourage your users to be creative in their password selection.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometimes a user uses his own name as his password, or his significant other's or pet's name; password-guessing is simple for anyone who knows him. Some people write their passwords down and tape them to their keyboards or monitors. These bad habits need to be avoided to completely secure your intranet.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In other words, the same good security practices that should be
followed in any networked computing environment should also be
made to apply in your intranet. Not doing so negates all the possible
security steps you can take and reduces the value of your intranet.
Even in the absence of malice, the failure to maintain any security
on your intranet will inevitably result in an intranet with little
real utility and value to its customers.
<H2><A NAME="SecurityonYourWebServer"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Security
on Your Web Server</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
It's useful to break the overall subject of World Wide Web server
security down into three pieces and discuss them separately. I'll
do so in this section, covering user/password authentication,
network address access limitations, and transaction encryption.
Bear in mind throughout the discussion of these separate pieces
that you can combine them in various ways to create flexible and
fine-grained access control. In fact, combining two, or even all
three, of these methods provides the best overall security.
<H3><A NAME="ControllingAccessGloballyandLocally">Controlling
Access Globally and Locally</A></H3>
<P>
Before I turn to the individual methods, I'll cover some high-level
information about Web server security setup.
<P>
Whichever individual security mechanisms you implement on your
Web server, the first thing you need to know is that you can implement
them at either or both of two levels. First, you can specify high-level
access control in a Global Access Configuration File (GACF), specifying
overall access rules for your server. In the NCSA httpd server
and those which are derived from it, such as the Windows httpd
and Apache servers, the GACF is called <TT>access.conf</TT>.
The CERN/W3 server doesn't have a separate GACF; rather, all access
control information is in the main server configuration file,
<TT>httpd.conf</TT>. The Netscape
servers have a graphical interface (actually, Netscape Navigator
itself) for overall server administration, including setting up
access control. If you feel more comfortable editing configuration
files, the Netscape server does allow them, calling them Dynamic
Configuration Files. Although you can do both global and local
configuration using the graphical tool, you can also manually
create a top-level Netscape Dynamic Configuration File, which
can then be hand-edited to function as a GACF.
<P>
Second, you can set up per-directory access control using local
ACFs (LACFs) for each directory or subdirectory tree. Usually
named <TT>.htaccess</TT> or <TT>.www_acl</TT>
(note the leading periods in the filenames), LACFs lay out access
control for an individual directory and its subdirectories, although
subdirectories can also have their own LACFs. The CERN/W3 server
can even extend protection to the individual file level using
LACFs. In the Netscape server, lower-level Dynamic Configuration
Files serve as LACFs. You can change the names of LACFs in both
the NCSA and Netscape servers, but you're stuck with <TT>.www_acl</TT>
in CERN/W3.
<P>
With a few important exceptions, you can do everything with an
LACF you can do with a GACF. Although you can control access to
every directory in your Web server document tree from the GACF,
you'll probably not want to do so, especially if your needs for
access control are complex. It's easy to make mistakes in a lengthy
configuration file like the GACF, and you'll get unexpected, unintended
results when you do. These might be hard to track down and might
not even show up without extensive testing. Overall, it's better
to use your GACF to establish a high-level security policy and
then set up lower-level, simpler controls using LACFs.<BR>

The CERN/W<FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT> server's LACF files have a completely different format than its GACF. Most of the examples in this chapter apply only to the format of the GACF.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
What's the GACF for, then? Most Webmasters use the GACF to establish
a general access policy for their Web server. For example, if
your Web server is accessible to the Internet at large and you're
not using a firewall system (see the &quot;Firewalls&quot; section
later in this chapter) to limit access to your network from the
outside, you may want to establish a policy in your GACF that
only computers with TCP/IP network addresses that are inside your
network can access your Web server's document tree. Similarly,
you can use the GACF to segregate public and private areas on
your Web server according to some criteria, and require usernames
and passwords for access to the private areas.
<P>
After you've established your overall policies, you can implement
LACFs to fine-tune your setup. In doing so, you can selectively
apply different access controls to the directory or directories
controlled by the LACF.
<P>
Earlier, exceptions to the statement that you can do everything
with an LACF you can do with a GACF were mentioned. Here is a
quick, incomplete list; you'll want to consult detailed server
documentation for comprehensive explanations of these and others.
The first one applies to all httpd servers, and the last three
refer only to UNIX servers.
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>If you want to control all access on your
Web server with your GACF, you can use it to prohibit the use
of LACFs altogether.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You can deny use of a potentially dangerous
and CPU-hogging feature called server-side includes, which actually
cause the server to execute outside commands each time a page
containing them is accessed, in user Web pages.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You can limit access to CGI-BIN scripts

tories.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You can prevent potential security problems
that can come from following UNIX symbolic links.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
With respect to symbolic links, confidential files on the system
that are completely outside of your Web server tree could be compromised
by a naive or malicious user. For example, if a user created a
symbolic link in her home directory pointing to the UNIX <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>
file, which contains usernames and encrypted passwords, outside
users could obtain a copy of that file using their Web browser
and then run a password-cracker on it offline. Of course, a malicious
user can grab <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>
himself and run the cracker directly, or e-mail the file to someone
else for the same reason, but that's no reason to make it easy
to do so via your intranet. (The UNIX System V <TT>/etc/shadow</TT>
file is not readable by non-root users, nor is the IBM AIX <TT>/etc/security/passwd</TT>
file.) See the section titled &quot;The Common Gateway Interface
(CGI) and Intranet Security&quot; later in this chapter for discussion
of CGI-BIN and server-side include security issues.
<P>
These generalities out of the way, let's turn our attention to
the three major elements of Web server security.
<H3><A NAME="UsernamePasswordAuthentication">Username/Password
Authentication</A></H3>
<P>
The first major element of Web server security is username/password
authentication. All the sample Web servers discussed in this book
provide this basic kind of security. I kick off this discussion
by looking at what the Web browser user sees when he encounters
a Web page that requires username/password authentication for
access. Figure 5.3 (part of NCSA's excellent access control tutorial,
at <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/</A></TT>)
shows a Prompt dialog box asking for a username. Once the username
is entered, a new dialog box asks for a password, as shown in
Figure 5.4.
<P>
<A HREF="f5-3.gif" ><B>Figure 5.3 : </B><I>The user is prompted to enter a username on a protected Web page.</I></A>
<P>
As you can infer from Figures 5.3 and 5.4, there are three aspects
of username/password authentication: the <I>username</I>, the
<I>password</I> that applies to that username, and what is permitted
to that user when a correct username and password are supplied.
Usernames and passwords are meaningless unless you specify a directory,
directory tree, or filename to which your username/password access
restrictions apply.
<P>
<A HREF="f5-4.gif" ><B>Figure 5.4 : </B><I>The user is also prompted for a password on a protected Web page.</I></A>
<P>
To make this more understandable, look at an example. Suppose
your httpd server's <TT>DocumentRoot</TT>
directory contains three main subdirectories, named <TT>public</TT>,
<TT>management</TT>, and <TT>personnel</TT>.
Using your GACF, you can specify that access to the <TT>management</TT>
and <TT>personnel</TT> subdirectory
trees requires username/password authentication, while <TT>public</TT>
is left wide open for anyone to access without being prompted
for a username and password. You can also set up LACFs within
the protected subdirectories to further limit access to particularly
sensitive documents by using usernames/passwords.
<H4>Setting Up Username/Password Authentication in a Netscape
Server</H4>
<P>
Of the servers covered in this book, setting up username/password
authentication is simplest in the Netscape servers. The Netscape
servers actually use the Netscape browser itself as a graphical
interface for administering the server, providing a set of private
Web pages and configuration scripts to do so. Using the Server
Manager page, you can easily enter new users and their passwords
into what Netscape calls the user database. (Your empty user database
must first be created before you can add any users and passwords
to it.) Figure 5.5 shows the User Database Management screen.
Notice there's an administrative password that must be given,
as well as the username and password for the user being added
to the database. After you've entered this information, click
Make These Changes.
<P>
<A HREF="f5-5.gif" ><B>Figure 5.5 : </B><I>The Netscape Communications Server Add-User form.</I></A>
<P>
After you've set up one or more users, you can continue to use
the Server Manager to apply access control rules to users. You
can associate groups of users together for purposes of authentication,
and define access control rules that apply to groups as well as
to individuals. With group access controls, users must still provide
their own usernames and passwords, but access to a specified area
of the server file tree (Netscape calls this a <I>realm</I>) can
be controlled by requiring that a user be a member of a group
for access. Even if a user provides the correct username and password,
he may be denied access based on group access control rules if
he is not a member of that realm's group.
<H4>Setting Up Username/Password Authentication in the CERN/W3
httpd Server</H4>
<P>
The CERN/W3 httpd server uses a UNIX-like password file (but with
only three colon-separated fields) containing usernames, encrypted
passwords, and users' real names. The password file is controlled
using the <TT>htadm</TT> program that
comes with the httpd server software. This program enables you
to create and delete user accounts, as well as change and verify
existing passwords. Although you can provide all the information
<TT>htadm</TT> needs on the command
line, it's easier to let the program prompt you for it. For example,
to add a new username and password:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT># path/to/htadm /path/to/passwordfile</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You must specify the name of the password file on the command
line, but<I> </I><TT>htadm</TT> will
prompt you for the function you want to perform and the actual
username, password, and user's real name, as appropriate. (You
can use multiple words in the <TT>realname</TT>
field to include a full name and other information.) If you're
in a hurry or have a long list of users to add or delete, you
can take advantage of specifying all the <TT>htadm</TT>
command-line arguments at once, like in these examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT># htadm -adduser passwordfile joeuser
joespassword Joe User<BR>
# htadm -deluser passwordfile baduser</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first example creates the user <TT>joeuser</TT>
with the password <TT>joespassword</TT>,
and the second deletes the user <TT>baduser</TT>.
This enables you to do mass account deletion using shell looping
and to take username, password, and real name input from a file.
You'll need something like the <TT>expect</TT>
package to do automated, mass account creation. There are also
<TT>-passwd</TT> and <TT>-check</TT>
command-line arguments to <TT>htadm</TT>,
which enable you to change and verify passwords, respectively.
<P>
As with the Netscape server, the CERN/W3 httpd server also enables
you to associate individual users with groups. You can set up
group authentication rules in LACFs that control access to portions
of your Web server document tree. CERN/W3 uses a group<I> </I>file,
the format of which is based on the standard UNIX <TT>/etc/group</TT>
format, but it has an added feature for defining access control
rules and for recursive inclusion of groups into metagroups. A
simple group file, which I'll use for examples in this chapter,
might be something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>management: tom, mary, joan<BR>
personnel: anne, joe, jerry<BR>
staff: management, personnel<BR>
public: All, Anybody</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here, four groups are defined. The first two each contain a list
of several individual usernames, but the last two are groups of
groups. (Two special groups, <I>All, </I>meaning all authenticated
users and <I>Anybody</I> meaning anyone, authenticated or not,
are predefined by the CERN/W3 httpd server software, and refer
to anyone who might access the server; see the server documentation
for details on the distinction between All and Anybody.)
<P>
After setting up your password and group files, you can add access
control protection to your server. As noted, high-level rules
go in <TT>httpd.conf</TT>, the GACF.
Access control rules in <TT>httpd.conf</TT>
use the <TT>Protect</TT> directive
and associated protection rulesets. Here's a simple <TT>Protect</TT>
directive, based on the group file shown above. It implements
the example division of your Web server's document tree into <TT>public</TT>,
<TT>management</TT>, and <TT>personnel</TT>
subtrees:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>Protect /personnel/* Personnel</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This example indicates that all subdirectories and files in the
<TT>personnel</TT> subtrees of your
Web server <TT>DocumentRoot</TT> are
subject to the rules in the protection ruleset named <TT>Personnel</TT>.
(You can name protection rulesets with any name you want, but
it makes sense to use meaningful names.) According to this <TT>Protect</TT>
directive, the ruleset itself also appears in the GACF<I>,</I>
under the label <TT>Personnel</TT>,
and might look like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>Protection Personnel {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AuthType&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passwordfile /usr/local/etc/httpd/passwd
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GroupFile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/local/etc/httpd/group
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetMask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel
<BR>
}<BR>
</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>Note</B></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT>Protect</TT> directive can specify the protection ruleset be read from a file, rather than from another part of the GACF. In this case, the directive would look like this:<BR>
<TT>Protect /personnel/* /usr/local/etc/httpd/acls/Personnel<BR>
</TT>Here, the absolute pathname to the file named <TT>Personnel</TT> (not relative to the server <TT>DocumentRoot</TT>) is specified. This example assumes you've created a special subdirectory (<TT>/usr/local/etc/httpd/acls</TT>) in which to store all your access control information. If you use individual files like this to define your protection rulesets, you need not enter the curly braces that are required in the GACF.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
This simple example applies username/password authentication access
control to all files and subdirectories in the <TT>personnel</TT>
directory, using the following criteria, all of which must be
met before access is granted:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Users must enter a username and password.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Usernames and passwords are validated
against the file </FONT><TT>/usr/local/etc/httpd/passwd</TT>.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Authenticated usernames are checked for
membership in the group named </FONT><TT>personnel</TT>
in the groups file<I> </I><TT>/usr/local/etc/httpd/group</TT>.
</UL>
<P>
Going back to the sample group file, you can see that only users
Anne, Joe, and Jerry will be granted access to files in this directory
tree. Even if Tom provides his correct password, he will not be
given access.
<P>
This has been a very cursory look at user authentication in the
CERN/W3 httpd server. <TT>Protect </TT>directives
and protection rulesets can be quite detailed, including other
features not described here. In addition, you can set up both
a default protection ruleset and progressively more limited protection
rulesets according to your own criteria, adding access control
all the way down to the individual file level. For details, see
the documentation which comes with the CERN/W3 httpd server software
(on the <I>Developing Intranet Applications with Java</I> CD-ROM).
Or check out the World Wide Web Consortium's online CERN/W3 httpd
documentation at <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/User/Admin.html">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/User/Admin.html</A></TT>.
<H4>Setting Up Username/Password Authentication in the NCSA httpd
Server</H4>
<P>
The NCSA httpd server, along with those derived from it (WinHttpd
for Windows and the Apache package for UNIX systems), provide
similar username/password authentication mechanisms. Except where
there are differences among these packages, I'll discuss them
as a group.
<P>
Although these packages use authentication methods that are similar
to the methods used in the CERN/W3 httpd package, there are differences.
Let's first focus on the similarities. Most importantly, the NCSA
packages support both GACFs and LACFs, enabling you to set high-level
policy at the server level and then fine-tune it at the directory
and subdirectory levels. In addition, both individual user and
group authentication are provided for. Finally, some configuration
commands, such as <TT>AllowOverride</TT>,
affecting critical items listed earlier might only appear in a
GACF. You can also disallow the use of server-side includes and
the following of symbolic links, for example, as described earlier.
<P>
The GACF in the NCSA packages is the file named <TT>access.conf</TT>
(<TT>access.cnf</TT> in WinHttpd)
and is located in the <TT>conf</TT>
subdirectory of your Web server's file tree. On UNIX systems,
the server is usually installed in <TT>/usr/local/etc/httpd</TT>,
and on Windows systems, the server is in <TT>c:\httpd</TT>.
In both cases, there exists a <TT>conf</TT>
subdirectory in the top-level httpd directory. However, the layout
and syntax of the <TT>access.conf</TT>
file is significantly different from the GACF in the CERN/W3 httpd
server.
<P>
The NCSA file is divided into sections, one for each directory
to be controlled. Each directory section in <TT>access.conf</TT>
looks something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>&lt;Directory /absolute/directory/path&gt;
<BR>
[ Various configuration commands ]<BR>
&lt;/Directory&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Like HTML markup, each <TT>Directory</TT>
(the literal word <TT>Directory</TT>
must appear) section is marked off by the <TT>access.conf</TT>
tags <TT>&lt;Directory&gt;</TT> and
<TT>&lt;/Directory&gt;</TT>, surrounded
with angle brackets. Case is not significant in the word <TT>Directory</TT>,
although it might be in the actual directory name.
<P>
The directory path here is an absolute pathname and is not relative
to either the Web server's <TT>ServerRoot</TT>
or <TT>DocumentRoot</TT> directories.
If you use <TT>/usr/local/etc/htdocs/</TT>,
for example, you must specify it in full and not just simply use
<TT>/htdocs</TT>. Within each <TT>Directory</TT>
section of the file, you specify one or more options, or configuration
commands, which will be applied by the server to the specified
directory. There are a number of different options, but we're
concerned here with username/password authentication.
<P>
Of course, before you can apply a username/password access control,
you need to have established users and passwords on your server.
Usernames and encrypted passwords are stored in a special httpd
password file. NCSA provides a utility program, <TT>htpasswd</TT>,
for creating this file; you'll find it in the <TT>support</TT>
subdirectory of your NCSA httpd server file tree, and you might
need to compile it. The syntax of the <TT>htpasswd</TT>
command is substantially simpler than that of the CERN/W3 <TT>htadm</TT>
command, as are its capabilities. To add a user to your password
file or change his password, use this syntax:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT># htpasswd /path/to/passwordfile username</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If you don't already have a password file, you need to modify
this command a bit:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT># htpasswd -c /path/to/passwordfile username</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The <TT>-c</TT> argument creates a
new password file, so you use it only once. If you use it again,
you'll erase your current password file. You can name your password
file anything you like.
<P>
You can't remove a user from your password file with the <TT>htpasswd</TT>
command. Instead, you'll have to hand-edit the password file with
a text editor and delete the user's entry. The format of the file
is quite simple, with just two fields in each record, separated
by a colon:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>tkevans:TyWhfX9/zYd7Y</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first field is the username. The second field is the encrypted
password. Permissions on the password file must be set so as to
be readable by the system user under whose userid the httpd server
runs (usually, the no-privileges user <TT>nobody</TT>),
so passwords are not stored in clear text.
<P>
Besides the httpd password file, the NCSA servers also respect
a group file in which you can define groups of users. Groups can
be treated like individual users with respect to access control,
so the group file can add capabilities and save data-entry time.
For the most part, syntax of the NCSA httpd group file is exactly
the same as that shown earlier in this chapter for the CERN/W3
group file.
<P>
There is one significant difference in what the two group files
may contain, however. As noted above, the CERN/W33 group file
can include group entries which consist of other groups. The NCSA
group file can include only individual users as members of groups.
Thus, the recursive staff group, consisting of all the members
of the personnel and management groups, is not possible in NCSA.
To create such a group, you would need to re-enter each user's
name in the group entry for <TT>staff</TT>.
<P>
Now that you've set up your password and group files, you're ready
to add username/password authentication in your GACF or LACFs.
Take a look at an example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT># Anybody in the personnel group can
get to the top level<BR>
# of the personnel filetree<BR>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/web-docs/personnel&gt;<BR>
AuthType Basic<BR>
AuthName Personnel Only<BR>
AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/userpw<BR>
AuthGroupFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/ourgroup<BR>
&lt;Limit GET&gt;<BR>
Require group personnel<BR>
&lt;/Limit&gt;<BR>
&lt;/Directory&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here, in the GACF file, you've limited access to the top level
of the <TT>personnel</TT> tree of
the Web server. Only members of the predefined group <TT>personnel</TT>
(defined in the <TT>ourgroup</TT>
file) are allowed to <TT>GET</TT>
(access) files in the directory tree, and they must provide a
valid username and password, verifiable against the encrypted
password in the <TT>userpw</TT> file.
<P>
Most of the lines in the example are clear, but a couple need
a little more explanation. <TT>AuthName</TT>
is just an arbitrary label for your rule; you should put something
there that'll make sense when you read the rule a year from now,
and you can use a phrase here. The <TT>&lt;Limit
GET&gt;</TT> subsection of the file is the critical section,
in which you actually specify who has access. You can also include
comments in the file, as indicated by the first two lines, where
the <TT>#</TT> symbol is used.
<P>
As I've noted, you can use LACFs to refine the access rules in
your GACF. Here's an example of an NCSA httpd LACF: a file named
<TT><I>.</FONT></I>htacces</TT>
in the <TT>personnel/executive</TT>
subdirectory. See if you can translate its meaning:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>AuthType Basic<BR>
AuthName Anne Only<BR>
AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/userpw<BR>
AuthGroupFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/ourgroup<BR>
&lt;Limit GET&gt;<BR>
Require user anne<BR>
&lt;/Limit&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You're right; this rule limits access to the <TT>executive</TT>
subdirectory to a single user: <TT>anne</TT>.
The heart of this rule is the matter between the <TT>&lt;Limit&gt;</TT>
and <TT>&lt;/Limit&gt;</TT> tags near
the end of the file. Other users, including the other members
of the <TT>personnel</TT> group, are
denied access, even if they give a correct password for themselves.
A dialog box will demand Anne's username and password. Notice
that this LACF file, which controls access to a single directory
(<TT>personnel/executive</TT>), does
not require the opening and closing <TT>&lt;Directory&gt;</TT>
and <TT>&lt;/Directory&gt;</TT> tags
required in the server's GACF because there are no subdirectories
in this directory.
<H4>Important Warnings About Username/Password Authentication
</H4>
<P>
Unless the access rules change (that is, new LACFs are encountered)
as a user moves around on your intranet Web pages (as with the
<TT>personnel/executive</TT> subdirectory
in the previous example), he will be prompted only once in his
browser session for a username and password. As long as he continues
his browser session, he can access all of the files and directories
available to him under the most recent access rule-without being
prompted again for his password. This is for the sake of convenience;
customers shouldn't have to repeatedly provide their usernames
and passwords at each step of the way when the access rule hasn't
changed.
<P>
However, this situation has important ramifications if you follow
it logically. Suppose Anne, having authenticated herself to access
the <TT>executive</TT> subdirectory,
leaves her Netscape or Mosaic session running, as most of us do.
Her privileged access remains open to all the files protected
by that one-time, possibly days-old, authentication. If she leaves
her workstation, PC, or terminal unattended when she goes to lunch
or goes home for the day, without any sort of active screen or
office door lock, anyone can sit down and browse the files and
directories that are supposed to be limited to Anne's eyes only.
This is a potential security breach, and one that the Webmaster<I>
</I>can do little about. This is really no different from a user
who leaves his workstation unattended without logging off. Although
you can try to educate your customers about such everyday security
matters, even though they have very little to do with your intranet,
you'll agree a security breach like this can be potentially harmful
to all your work.
<P>
User passwords are transmitted over your network by most Web browsers
in a relatively insecure fashion. It is not terribly difficult
for a user with a network snooper running to pick out the httpd
network packets containing user passwords. Although the passwords
are not transmitted in clear text, the encoding/encryption method
is a very old and widely used one. Every UNIX system, for example,
has a program (<TT>uudecode</TT>)
that can decode the encrypted password in a captured httpd packet.
If you believe this may be a problem on your intranet, you'll
want to consider the secure Web servers and browsers that encrypt
user-transmitted data, as discussed in the section titled &quot;Secure/Encrypted
Transactions,&quot; later in this chapter.
<H3><A NAME="AuthenticationBasedonNetworkHostname">Authentication
Based on Network Hostname or Address</A></H3>
<P>
All the Web servers discussed in this chapter provide an additional
authentication method, using the TCP/IP hostname or numerical
network address of customer workstations or PCs as access criteria.
As you'll learn in later chapters, in the context of CGI-BIN programming,
every Web browser request for a document or other intranet resource
contains the numerical IP address of the requesting computer.
Servers look up hostnames using these addresses and the Domain
Name Service (DNS). You can set up rules in your GACFs and LACFs
based on either of these, making a considerable amount of fine-tuning
possible.
<H4>Hostname/Address Authentication in the NCSA Servers</H4>
<P>
Because the format of the NCSA <TT>access.conf</TT>
file is still fresh in your mind from the last section, look at
this one first in the context of hostname/network address authentication.
You'll place your rules for this sort of authentication within
the <TT>&lt;Limit&gt;</TT> and<TT>
&lt;/Limit&gt;</TT> tags of the server's GACFs or LACFs
<TT>&lt;Directory&gt;</TT> sections.
Do this with several new access control directives, including
<UL>
<LI><TT>Order</TT>, which specifies
the order in which the other directives in the file are to be
evaluated.
<LI><TT>Allow</TT>, which permits
access based on a hostname or IP address.
<LI><TT>Deny</TT>, which denies access
based on a hostname or IP address.
</UL>
<P>
Here's a simple example limiting access to the <TT>personnel</TT>
subtrees of your Web server. (The opening and closing <TT>&lt;Directory&gt;</TT>
tags have been left off so as to cut right to the chase.) For
purposes of this example, I'll assume your company's TCP/IP network
domain is subdivided along operational lines and that there is
a <TT>personnel</TT> subdomain in
which all of the computers have IP addresses beginning with <TT>123.45.67</TT>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>&lt;Limit GET&gt;<BR>
order deny,allow<BR>
deny from all<BR>
allow from personnel.mycompany.com<BR>
allow from 123.45.67<BR>
&lt;/Limit&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In plain English, this example rule says, &quot;access is denied
to all hostnames and IP addresses <I>except</I> those in the subdomain
<TT>personnel.mycompany.com</TT> and
those in the numerical IP address family <TT>123.45.67</TT>.&quot;
Notice that both the subdomain name and IP address family are
wildcards that might match many computers; you can also use individual
hostnames or addresses for even finer-grained control.
<P>
As you can see, I've used each of the three directives listed.
You might wonder why I used both <TT>allow
</TT>and <TT>deny</TT> statements.
The World Wide Web was built with openness in mind, not security.
The server therefore assumes, without instructions to the contrary,
all directories are accessible to all hostnames/addresses. (This
is the same as the username/password authentication about which
you learned earlier. In the absence of a username/password requirement,
all directories and files are accessible to all users.) Without
a <TT>deny</TT> directive, the rule
might just as well not exist. The server assumes, in the absence
of a <TT>deny</TT> directive, all
hostnames/addresses are allowed access. Why have any rule at all,
then, if all are allowed access? In other words, it makes no sense
to have rules with <TT>allow</TT>
directives that don't have <TT>deny</TT>
directives.
<P>
Because you must have both <TT>deny</TT>
and <TT>allow</TT> directives in order
to have meaningful access rules, the order in which the rules
are evaluated is important. One way to evaluate your implementation
is to follow the actual order in which the directives appear in
the file, but it's easy to make mistakes with this approach. Instead,
NCSA httpd uses the <TT>order</TT>
directive so you can explicitly instruct that your directives
be processed in the order you want. The example uses <TT>order
deny,access</TT>, indicating all incoming requests are
to be tested against the <TT>deny</TT>
directives first and then tested against the <TT>allow</TT>
directives. In the example, you set up a general <TT>deny</TT>
rule and then make exceptions to it. The <TT>order</TT>
directive can also be turned around, with <TT>allow</TT>
rules processed first. Using this sequence, you can make your
server generally available and then add selective denials. For
example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>&lt;Limit GET&gt;<BR>
order allow,deny<BR>
allow from all<BR>
deny from .mycompetitor.com<BR>
&lt;/Limit&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here, you're granting access to your server to everyone <I>except</I>
your competitor. For more information about hostname/IP address
authentication, see the NCSA httpd server documentation on the
<I>Developing Intranet Applications with Java</I> CD-ROM, or the
authentication tutorial at NCSA's Web site, <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/</A></TT>.
<H4>Hostname/Address Authentication in the CERN/W3 Server</H4>
<P>
You can also impose hostname/IP address access control with the
CERN/W3 httpd<I> </I>server. Although you can accomplish the same
ends as with the NCSA server, the method of doing so is different,
and the access control file formats are different. As you'll recall
from the earlier username/password authentication, the CERN/W3
httpd<I> </I>server uses protection rulesets in the GACF or LACF.
I'll modify the earlier example in which you limited access to
the <TT>personnel</TT> portion of
your Web server by group name to illustrate hostname/IP address
authentication. For purposes of this example, I'll assume that
your company's TCP/IP network domain is subdivided along operational
lines and that there is a <TT>personnel</TT>
subdomain, all of the computers in which have IP addresses beginning
with <TT>123.45.67</TT>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
}</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As you can see, the only thing changed about this ruleset is the
<TT>GetMask</TT> line. In the earlier
example, I used <TT>GetMask</TT> to
limit access based on membership in a defined group of usernames,
<TT>personnel</TT>. Here, I've done
access control limitation in two ways. First, I specified an sub-domain
name (<TT>personnel.mycompany.com</TT>).
Second, the rule contains a numerical IP address family. In both
cases, I've used a special wildcard syntax; note the use of both
the <TT>@</TT> symbol and the asterisk
(<TT>*</TT>). You can think of the
string <TT>@*.personnel.mycompany.com</TT>
as meaning any user at any computer in the <TT>personnel</TT>
subdomain. Similarly, <TT>@123.45.67.*</TT><I>
</I>refers to any user at any computer with an IP address beginning
with <TT>123.45.67</TT>.
<P>
Actually it was not needed. You might be wondering why, since
all computers in the <TT>personnel</TT>
subdomain have IP addresses in the <TT>123.45.67</TT>
family, I've included both rules. I did this for a couple of reasons.
The first is to show that you can use either symbolic host/domain/subdomain
names or numerical IP addresses.
<P>
The second reason is a more technical one. In some cases, your
httpd server won't be able to resolve the hostname of a computer
making a request for a document from the numerical IP address
it receives in the browser request. The reasons for this inability
vary, but they usually involve out-of-date or inaccurate DNS information.
In growing networks, newly networked computers might not get added
to the database promptly. Errors in DNS configuration, such as
misspelled hostnames, can also result in unresolvable hostnames.
To be safe, placing both symbolic host/domain name and numerical
IP address information in your <TT>GetMask</TT>
is a good idea; there's nothing like having the boss's brand-new
PowerMac being denied access to your intranet's Web server on
his very first try because its DNS entry hasn't been made by the
network operations staff yet.
<H4>Hostname/Address Authentication in the Netscape Server</H4>
<P>
As with most aspects of Netscape Communications Server administration,
you can set up hostname/IP address access control using a graphical
interface. Start up the Administration Manager and select Restrict
Access From Certain Addresses. This opens a document with extensive
instructions for setting up access restrictions. You'll find fill-in
boxes in this document for hostname/IP address restrictions. Figures
5.6, 5.7, and 5.8 show the essential parts of this form. You have
all the same choices here for restricting access that you saw
in the NCSA and CERN/W3 httpd servers.
<P>
<A HREF="f5-6.gif" ><B>Figure 5.6 : </B><I>Netscape Communications Server Host restriction (Part 1).</I></A>
<P>
<A HREF="f5-7.gif" ><B>Figure 5.7 : </B><I>Netscape Communications Server Host restriction (Part 2)</I></A>
<P>
The first step is to select what Netscape calls a <I>resource</I>
to which you'll apply hostname/IP address restriction. For this
purpose, a resource can be the entire Web server tree, a particular
part of it, or one or more individual files. Clickable buttons
(as shown at the top of Figure 5.6) enable you to select the resource
you want. In this example, your resource would be the <TT>/usr/local/web-docs/personnel</TT>
subdirectory of your httpd server tree. After you've selected
your resource, scroll down the form to the headline <TT>What
To Protect</TT>. (See Figure 5.7.) Here, you'll find two
important choices.
<P>
You can simply accept the default of protecting everything in
the selected resource. Or you can specify a wildcard filename
pattern to match the files you want to protect. Notice the hypertext
link labeled <TT>wildcard pattern</TT>,
which takes you to a detailed document describing how wildcard
pattern-matching works in the Netscape servers. (Essentially,
it's standard UNIX shell filename expansion, but has some additional
features.)
<P>
For the purposes of the example, you need not enter anything,
because you're going to accept the default restriction to all
files and directories in the <TT>personnel</TT>
resource. However, you could have entered the wildcard pattern
for the files to which you wanted to apply your hostname/IP address
restrictions in the boxed and labeled <TT>Pattern
of files to protect</TT>. The <TT>Addresses
to allow</TT> section, which starts in Figure 5.7 and ends
in Figure 5.8, tells you how to enter hostnames and IP addresses.
<P>
<A HREF="f5-8.gif" ><B>Figure 5.8 : </B><I>Netscape Communications Server Host restriction (Part 3)</I></A>
<P>
As with filenames, you can enter either specific individual hostnames
or IP addresses, or wildcard patterns that match multiple hosts.
The <TT>Hostnames to allow</TT> and
<TT>IP addresses to allow</TT> boxes
are shown in Figure 5.8 with the <TT>personnel</TT>
example filled in.
<P>
The bottom of Figure 5.8 shows how you can set up a custom message
to users who try to access restricted resources, giving them a
reason for the denial of their request. You need not use this,
but it can be friendlier than the generic <TT>Not
Found</TT> message most httpd servers return. Here, I've
set things up so the contents of the file <TT>/usr/local/web-docs/private.txt</TT>
will be returned. This file could explain politely, for example,
that access to <TT>personnel</TT>
resources on the Web server is limited to the Personnel Department.
After you finish the form, scroll all the way to the bottom (not
shown in Figure 5.8) and click Make These Changes to apply your
restrictions.
<H4>An Important Warning About Hostname/IP Address Authentication
</H4>
<P>
All of the Web server software described in this chapter trustingly
accepts the word of a requesting computer when it sends its IP
address. Verification of this information is not possible. It's
relatively easy for a user to change the hostname/IP address of
a UNIX system, and laughably easy to change that of a PC or Mac.
A curious, mischievous, or malicious person can reconfigure his
computer to impersonate someone else's simply by changing the
IP address of his own. Although this is an overall network security
issue, not specifically one for your intranet, it's important
you know about it because it can affect the security of your access
controlled documents. Security-minded network administrators can
use special hardware and software to prevent this sort of IP spoofing,
but for your intranet, you'll probably want to combine hostname/IP
address authentication with username/password authentication,
as outlined in the following section.
<H3><A NAME="CombinedAuthentication">Combined Authentication</A>
</H3>
<P>
Now that you understand how username/password and hostname/IP
address authentication work separately, consider how you can combine
the two to beef up your access control. Begin with the Netscape
Communications Server.
<H4>Combined Authentication in the Netscape Server</H4>
<P>
Netscape's scanty $40 documentation for the Communications Server
doesn't address this subject directly, but you can infer from
it how to implement combined username/password and hostname/IP
address authentication. As you learned earlier, the Netscape server
uses one or more user databases to store usernames and passwords,
and you can apply access control limits based on both individual
usernames and on group membership. Also, the Netscape server can
restrict access by hostname/IP address, as described in the previous
section. Although the Netscape Communications Server manual and
its essentially identical online help describe these two methods
as an either/or choice, it would appear that applying both kinds
of access control to a single resource would result in both methods
being applied. In other words, you can
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Define a set of users, such as the sample
</FONT><TT>personnel</TT> group I've
used, in the Netscape user database.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Apply username/password authentication,
such as to the </FONT><TT>personnel</TT>
resource, limiting access to the members of the <TT>personnel</TT>
group in the user database.
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Apply hostname/IP address restrictions,
such as to the same </FONT><TT>personnel</TT>
resource, limiting access to those computers in the <TT>personnel</TT>
subdomain (or even to the individual computers of the members
of the <TT>personnel</TT> group).
</UL>
<P>
Because the documentation doesn't say what happens in such a situation,
including whether there is an order of precedence in the testing
of the access control rules, you should very carefully check how
things work when you set up intersecting access control rules
of this sort. 
<P>
For example, it isn't clear which rule would be applied first.
If the username/password authentication rule goes first, the user
will be prompted for a username and password. The hostname/IP
address rule would then deny access to even authenticated users.
Applying the hostname/IP address rule first, however, will correct
this problem.
<P>
Fortunately for those who want to have their access control rules
perform exactly as they want them to, Netscape provides another
means of access control, using Dynamic Configuration Files (DCFs).
You can think of Netscape's DCFs as what I've called LACFs in
this chapter-access control files that apply to a single directory
or subdirectory on your Web server. Normally named <TT>.nsconfig</TT>
(note the leading period in the filename), DCFs are organized
into discrete sections with HTML-like markup. Each section is
marked off by the tags <TT>&lt;Files&gt;</TT>
and<TT> &lt;/Files&gt;</TT>, in between
which are access control and other rules that apply to the files
specified. You can do many things with Netscape DCFs; here's an
example that replicates the combined username/password and hostname/IP
address access control to the <TT>personnel</TT>
section of the example Web server:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>&lt;Files *&gt;<BR>
RequireAuth dbm=webusers userpat=&quot;anne|joe|jerry&quot; userlist=&quot;anne,joe,jerry&quot;
<BR>
RestrictAccess method=HTTP method-type=allow ip=123.45.67.* dns=*.personnel.mycompany.com
<BR>
&lt;/Files&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This DCF, which goes in the top level of the <TT>/usr/local/web-docs/personnel</TT>
directory, applies to all files and subdirectories in that directory
tree. It requires username/password authentication, limiting access
to users <TT>anne</TT>, <TT>joe</TT>,
and <TT>jerry</TT> listed in the Netscape
user database named <TT>webusers</TT>.
It further limits access by both numerical IP address and symbolic
hostname, both using wildcards. Notice that it's not necessary
to specify both <TT>allow</TT> and
<TT>deny</TT> rules; Netscape's server
takes a more conservative approach to access restrictions than
do NCSA and CERN/W3.<BR>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>Tip</B></TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Netscape DCFs in lower-level directories take precedence over the rules in a DCF in a higher-level directory. Thus, by creating a <TT>.nsconfig</TT> file in the <TT>personnel/executive</TT> subdirectory, you can limit access to files in that directory to the user <TT>anne</TT>, as you did earlier in this chapter. Such a DCF might look like this:
<BR>
<TT>&lt;Files *&gt;<BR>
RequireAuth dbm=webusers userpat=anne userlist=anne<BR>
RestrictAccess method=HTTP method-type=allow ip=123.45.67.89 dns=annspc.personnel.mycompany.com<BR>
&lt;/Files&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
You can enable Netscape DCFs using fill-in forms similar to those
shown earlier for setting up hostname/IP address access control.
For example, you can enable a DCF for a given server resource,
and the graphical interface will create a skeleton <TT>.nsconfig</TT>
file. However, you'll need to use a text editor to add your own
detailed access control and other directives.
<H4>Combined Authentication in the NCSA Servers</H4>
<P>
Combining username/password and hostname/IP address authentication
in the NCSA httpd servers is fairly simple. You'll extend the
rules in the <TT>&lt;Limit&gt;</TT>
sections of either the GACF or LACF. Here's the now-familiar <TT>personnel</TT>
example, modified to combine the two access control methods:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>AuthType Basic<BR>
AuthName Personnel Only<BR>
AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/userpw<BR>
AuthGroupFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/ourgroup<BR>
&lt;Limit GET&gt;<BR>
order deny,allow<BR>
deny from all<BR>
allow from personnel.mycompany.com<BR>
allow from 123.45.67<BR>
Require group personnel<BR>
&lt;/Limit&gt;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As you can see, all you needed to do was to pull in both of the
two sample methods shown in the earlier NCSA examples. Notice
that order counts in the <TT>&lt;Limit&gt;</TT>
section. Here, the hostname/IP address access control rules are
applied first (using the <TT>deny</TT>
and then <TT>allow</TT> sequence).
After those rules are satisfied, the user is prompted for a password
as the username/password authentication is applied. Based on this
example, it's easy to modify this rule for an LACF in the <TT>personnel/executive</TT>
subdirectory, simply by replacing <TT>Require
group personnel</TT> with <TT>Require
user anne</TT>.
<H4>Combined Authentication in the CERN/W3 Server</H4>
<P>
The CERN/W3 Server is similarly capable of combining username/password
and hostname/IP address authentication. Here, you'll modify the
<TT>GetMask</TT><I> </I>directive
in your GACF. Again, here is the modified <TT>personnel</TT>
example, this time limiting access using both methods:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>Protection Personnel {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AuthType&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passwordfile /usr/local/etc/httpd/passwd
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GroupFile&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/local/etc/httpd/group
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetMask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@*.personnel.mycompany.com,
@123.45.67.*,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personnel
<BR>
}</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
As with the NCSA example, this one applies hostname/IP address
access control first (since it appears on the <TT>GetMask</TT>
line first) and then username/password authentication. Both rules
must be satisfied before access is permitted. To further restrict
access, you'll need to develop LACFs for individual directories
and subdirectories. As noted earlier, the CERN/W3 LACF file's
format is completely different from that of the server's GACF.
Here's one (note the file must be named <TT>.www_acl</TT>)<I>
</I>that can be<I> </I>placed in the <TT>personnel/executive</TT>
directory to limit access to the subdirectory to user <TT>anne</TT>,
and only from a specific hostname/IP address:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>*&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;GET&nbsp;&nbsp;:
anne@annspc.personell.mycompany.com,<BR>
ann@123.45.67.89</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This simple file has just one rule. (The rule is usually a single
line, with colon-separated records, but it can be wrapped, as
shown above, after a comma.) No one other than the user <TT>anne</TT>
(who must give a password under the rule in the previous example)
can access any files in the <TT>personnel/executive</TT>
directory. Moreover, <TT>anne</TT>
must be accessing the files from her normal PC to be granted access,
even if she gives the correct password. For more information on
CERN/W3 LACFs, check out the online documentation at <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/User/Admin.html">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Daemon/User/Admin.html</A></TT>.
<H2><A NAME="SecureEncryptedTransactions"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Secure/Encrypted
Transactions</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
You can further enhance security on your intranet by encrypting
Web transactions. When you use an encryption facility, information
submitted by customers using Web fill-in forms-including usernames,
passwords, and other confidential information-can be transmitted
securely to and from the Web server.
<P>
There are a wide range of proposed or partially implemented encryption
solutions for the Web, but most are not ready for prime time.
Of the several proposed methods, only two have emerged in anything
like full-blown form. Let's look at the Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) and
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols in this chapter. Unfortunately,
the two protocols are not compatible with each other. Worse, Web
browsers and servers that support one method don't support the
other, so you can reliably use one or the other only if you carefully
match your Web server and customers' browsers.
<H3><A NAME="SecureHTTPSHTTP">Secure HTTP (S-HTTP)</A></H3>
<P>
S-HTTP was developed by Enterprise Integration Technologies and
RSA Data Security, and the public S-HTTP standards are now managed
by CommerceNet, a nonprofit consortium conducting the first large-scale
market trial of technologies and business processes to support
electronic commerce over the Internet. (For general information
on CommerceNet, see <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.commerce.net/">http://www.commerce.net/</A></TT>.)
S-HTTP is a modified version of the current httpd protocol. It
supports
<UL>

Digital Signatures and Signature Keys using both the RSA and MD5

<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Generation of key certificates for server

</UL>
<P>
EIT has developed modified versions of the NCSA httpd server and
NCSA Mosaic (for UNIX and Microsoft Windows), which both support
S-HTTP transactions. Although the licensing terms allow for NCSA
to fold EIT's work into its free httpd server and Mosaic browsers,
there's been no public indication of NCSA's plans to do so. Meanwhile,
the CommerceNet secure NCSA httpd server and Mosaic browser are
available only to members of CommerceNet. You'll find information
about both packages, including full-text user manuals, at the
CommerceNet home page <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.commerce.net/">http://www.commerce.net/</A></TT>.
<H3><A NAME="SecureSocketsLayerSSL">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</A>
</H3>
<P>
S-HTTP seems to have been engulfed in the 1995 Netscape tidal
wave. Unwilling to wait for widely accepted httpd security standards
to evolve (as it was with HTML as well), Netscape Communications
Corporation developed its own SSL encryption mechanism. SSL occupies
a spot on the ISO seven-layer network reference below that of
the httpd protocol, which operates at the application layer. Rather
than developing a completely new protocol to replace httpd, SSL
sits between httpd and the underlying TCP/IP network protocols
and can intervene to create secure transactions. Netscape makes
the technical details of SSL publicly available. In addition,
C-language source code for a reference implementation of SSL is
freely available for noncommercial use.
<P>
The Netscape Navigator Web browser has built-in SSL support, as
does the Netscape Commerce Server; the Netscape Communications
Server does not support SSL. Given Netscape's share of the Web
browser market, it's hard to see how S-HTTP has much of a chance
at becoming widely available. With the exception of NCSA Mosaic,
most other Web browsers have-or have promised-SSL support. Some
of them are Spry's newer product, Internet in a Box, Mosaic in
a Box for Windows 95, and Release 2 of Microsoft's Internet Explorer
for Windows 95 and the Macintosh. By the time you read this book,
all of these packages might have completed their SSL implementations.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even though a browser might support secure transactions using SSL or S-HTTP, no transactions are actually secure except those between the browser and a compatible Web server. Thus, using Netscape, for example, won't provide any security unless you're also using the Netscape Commerce Server. It's also important to note that simply using a proxy service (that is, passing Web services through network firewalls) does not imply secure transactions unless <I>both</I> the proxy server and the destination server do.

As noted in the preceding section, the Netscape Commerce Server
supports the company's SSL security mechanism. Other packages
that support SSL include the Secure WebServer package from Open
Market, Inc., (<TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.openmarket.com/">http://www.openmarket.com/</A></TT>),
which also supports S-HTTP, and IBM's Internet Connection Secure
Server, which runs under IBM's UNIX, AIX Version 4, and OS/2 Warp.
(Evaluation copies of Secure WebServer for several UNIX systems
are available at the Open Market Web site.)
<P>
Both Secure WebServer and Internet Connection Secure Server are
based on Terisa Systems, Inc.'s SecureWeb Client and Server Toolkit.
This package provides source code for developers building secure

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) and Intranet Security</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
CGI is the mechanism that stands behind all the wonderful, interactive
fill-in forms you'll want to put on your intranet. Your customers
might demand these kinds of intranet resources. CGI-BIN scripting
is susceptible to security problems, so do your scripting carefully
to avoid such problems.
<P>
You can minimize much of your risk of security breaches in CGI-BIN
scripting by focusing on one particular area: Include in your
scripts explicit code for dealing with unexpected user input.
The reason for this is simple: You should never trust any information
a user enters in a fill-in form. Just because, for instance, a
fill-in form asks for a user's name or e-mail address, there is
no guarantee that the user filling in the form won't put in incorrect
information. Customers make typographical errors, but probing
crackers, even those inside your organization, might intentionally
enter unexpected data in an attempt to break the script. Such
efforts can include UNIX shell meta-characters and other shell
constructs (such as the asterisk, the pipe, the back tick, the
dollar sign, and the semicolon) in an effort to get the script
to somehow give the user shell access. Others intentionally try
to overflow fixed program text buffers to see if the program can
be coaxed into overwriting the program's stack. To be secure,
your CGI-BIN scripts have to anticipate and deal safely with unexpected
input.
<P>
Other problems inherent with CGI-BIN scripts include
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Calling outside programs, opening potential
security holes in the external program. The UNIX sendmail program
is a favorite cracker target.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Using server-side includes in scripts,
which dynamically generate HTML code. Make sure user input doesn't
include literal HTML markup that could call a server-side include

Is your intranet accessible from the Internet? If so, all of the
security problems of the Internet are now your intranet's problems,
too. Throughout this book, an implicit assumption has been made
that your intranet is private to your organization. You can, however,
connect safely to the Internet and still protect your intranet.
You can even use the Internet as a means of letting remote sites
in your company access your intranet.
<P>
First, look at some Internet security basics.
<H3><A NAME="Firewalls">Firewalls</A></H3>
<P>
It's a fact of Internet life that there are people out there who
want to break into other people's networks via the Internet. Reasons
vary from innocent curiosity to malicious cracking to business
and international espionage. At the same time, the value of the
Internet to organizations and businesses is so great that vendors
are rushing to fill the need for Internet security with Internet
firewalls. An Internet firewall is a device that sits between
your internal network and the outside Internet. Its purpose is
to limit access into and out of your network based on your organization's
access policy.
<P>
A firewall can be anything from a set of filtering rules set up
on the router between you and the Internet to an elaborate application
gateway consisting of one or more specially configured computers
that control access. Firewalls permit desired services coming
from the outside, such as Internet e-mail, to pass. In addition,
most firewalls now allow access to the World Wide Web from inside
the protected networks. The idea is to allow some services to
pass but to deny others. For example, you might be able to use
the Telnet utility to log into systems on the Internet, but users
on remote systems cannot use it to log into your local system
because of the firewall.
<P>
Here are a couple of good general Web resources about Internet
firewalls:

<P>
If your company is also connected to the Internet, you'll want
to know how to make sure your intranet isn't generally accessible
to the outside world. You learned earlier in this chapter about
denying access to your Web server using hostname and IP address
authentication, but the fact that IP addresses can be easily spoofed
makes it essential that you not rely on this mechanism as your
only protection. You'll still want to rely on an Internet firewall
to protect your intranet, as well as all your other network assets.
Moreover, unless your corporate network is not connected to the
outside world at all, you'll want to ensure the security of your
other intranet services, including not only your Web servers,
but also your FTP, Gopher, Usenet news, WAIS, and other TCP/IP
network services.

More and more companies with widely distributed offices, manufacturing
sites, and other facilities are turning to use the Internet to
replace private corporate networks connecting the sites. Such
a situation involves multiple connections to the Internet by the
company, with the use of the Internet itself as the backbone network
for the company. Although such an approach is fraught with security
risks, many organizations are using it for non-sensitive information
exchange within the company. Using a properly configured firewall,
companies can provide access to services inside one site's network
to users at another site. Still, however, the data that flows
across the Internet backbones between the corporate sites is usually
unencrypted, plain text data that Internet snoopers can easily
read. Standard firewalls don't help with this situation.
<P>
A number of firewall companies have recently developed Virtual
Private Network (VPN) capabilities. Essentially, VPN is an extension
of standard firewall capabilities to permit authenticated, encrypted
communications between sites over the Internet. That is, using
a VPN, users at a remote site can access sensitive data at another
site in a secure fashion over the Internet. All the data that
flows on the public Internet backbones is encrypted before it
leaves the local network and then decrypted when it arrives at
the other end of the connection.
<P>
The VPN is similar to a wide area network, or WAN, in that you
are connecting one or more smaller networks together. WANs, however,
typically utilize dedicated phone lines to communicate with each
other. Many T1 and T3 lines are used for this purpose daily all
over the world. This WAN setup can be quite secure because the
information flow is over private telephone networks, not a giant
chaotic network like the Internet. 
<P>
WANs are not as prone to outages as VPNs are. That is because
the VPN is at the mercy of a) your Internet service provider,
and possibly b) your Internet service provider's Internet service
provider. If either of these two sites go down, you're in the
dark. That's a bad thing when you need to get at your corporate
database in Chicago for a meeting that started five minutes ago.
<P>
What VPNs do give you is secure communications over a relatively
cheap medium. Instead of paying hundreds or possibly thousands
of dollars per network drop site, plus the cost of WAN equipment
(which can get expensive), you simply pay for an Internet connection.
These can be had for as little as $125.00 per month. Granted you
won't get much bandwidth for that price, but it's a start. If
you are considering extending your corporate network, consider
VPNs too.
<P>
The most mature VPN product comes from Raptor Systems (<TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.raptor.com/">http://www.raptor.com/</A></TT>),
part of the company's Eagle family of products, and others are
available from Checkpoint (<TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.checkpoint.com/">http://www.checkpoint.com/</A></TT>)
and Telecommerce (<TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://www.telecommerce.com/">http://www.telecommerce.com/</A></TT>).
<P>
Figure 5.9 shows a schematic drawing of a VPN, reprinted with
the permission of Raptor Systems, Inc. The cloud represents the
Internet, and the firewall system, local network, and remote site
are shown as workstations. The broad line connecting the workstation
at the remote site to the local workstation illustrates the VPN.
Such products make it possible for you to extend the availability
of your intranet to remote company sites without having to set
up a private network.

This chapter has dealt with implementing security on your intranet.
Although an intranet is, by definition, internal to an organization,
security is important not so much because it prevents things,
but because it enables them. Judicious use of built-in security
features of Web servers and other intranet resources can add value
to your intranet by making new things possible. In this chapter,
you have
