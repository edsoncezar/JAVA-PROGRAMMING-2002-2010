<P>
For users and developers new to the Java world, the great amount
of new terminology tends to be a little confusing. Questions often
asked are
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>What separates a Java applet from a Java
application?</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Can any Web browser run a Java applet?</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>What is the difference between Java, JavaScript,
and HotJava?</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
The answer to the first question can be found by reading <A HREF="ch7.htm" >Chapters 7 </A>and
<A HREF="ch8.htm" >8</A>, &quot;Developing Java Applets&quot;
and &quot;Developing Java Applications.&quot; This chapter will
focus on the second question-Web browsers that support Java applets.
By demonstrating the capabilities of these Web browsers, the differences
between Java, JavaScript, and HotJava should become apparent.
<P>
Currently, three Web browsers support Java applets: Sun HotJava,
Netscape Navigator 2.0 (or greater), and Microsoft Internet Explorer
3.0. This chapter will explore these three products and illustrate
differences between them. The first browser to be examined will
be Sun's HotJava.
<H2><A NAME="TheHotJava10Browser"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>The
HotJava 1.0 Browser</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
The HotJava Browser is a product of Sun Microsystems' JavaSoft.
It is the only Web browser that not only supports Java applets
but also is actually written in Java. Although the browser market
is dominated at the present time by Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's
Internet Explorer, the HotJava 1.0 release will run as a platform-independent
application. This means that if devices such as Oracle's Network
Computer become widely used, HotJava will undoubtedly be the first
browser available for these platforms. Because the beta versions
of HotJava were written using a special version of the JDK, however,
pre-1.0 releases are platform-dependent.
<P>
What is now known as the HotJava product actually was introduced
as a stand-alone Web browser back in the spring of 1995. As Java's
potential was recognized by the public and its popularity skyrocketed,
HotJava came to be much more than a Web browser. The HotJava product
now refers to a set of Java class libraries that simplifies the
creation of Internet-aware applications. The HotJava browser is
provided as a showcase of these class libraries' capabilities.
The HotJava class library will be available from JavaSoft as a
licensable product at a later date. At this time, HotJava can
best be explored by downloading and installing the HotJava Web
browser.

<H4>Installation Tips</H4>
<P>
If you followed the preceding steps, the HotJava browser should
be ready to run. Test the installation by running the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HOTJAVA.EXE</FONT></TT>
application. If the browser returns an error or is unable to run,
read on for a list of potential problems:
<OL>
<LI>Under Windows 95, the HotJava browser requires the Microsoft
Windows 95 TCP/IP drivers. If your system is using anything but
these drivers, HotJava will be unable to run.
<LI>HotJava will not run under Windows 3.1. Do not confuse Windows
3.1 with Windows 95/NT because they are actually very different
platforms.
<LI>Don't forget to delete the downloaded file after its contents
have been extracted. This will free up file system space.
<LI>If you were unable to extract the downloaded files, make sure
that they were downloaded using binary format, not ASCII.
</OL>
<H3><A NAME="HotJavaFeatures">HotJava Features</A></H3>
<P>
The HotJava Web browser supports many of the most popular browser
features. Most importantly, of course, it fully supports the running
of Java applets (<A HREF="ch7.htm" >see Chapter 7</A> for more
information on applets). It also has the following features, some
of which are unique to HotJava:
<UL>
<LI><B>Security</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Because HotJava was written using
the Java language, it provides a secure environment for Java applets
to run in. Later in this chapter, HotJava's security options will
be examined in detail.
<LI><B>HTML 2.0+ Support</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;HotJava will correctly
display all HTML pages that support the HTML 2.0 standard. In
addition, HotJava provides support for tables, forms, and client-side
image maps (<A HREF="ch12.htm" >see Chapter 12</A>, &quot;HTML
for Java Programmers,&quot; for more information on HTML).
<LI><B>External Viewers</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the HotJava browser
will natively display a number of file formats such as HTML, GIF,
and JPEG, its designers realized the need to occasionally view
documents of other types. HotJava allows the user to configure
viewers based on the file's MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
type.
<LI><B>Configurable User Interface</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The HotJava
user interface is completely contained within files included with
the HotJava installation. These files can be changed or replaced,
allowing users to completely modify their HotJava browser's appearance.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="UsingHotJava">Using HotJava</A></H3>
<P>
HotJava can be run by executing the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HOTJAVA</FONT></TT>
application located in your installation's <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">bin</FONT></TT>
directory. Figure 13.1 shows the HotJava browser loaded and running
under Windows 95.
<P>
<A HREF="f13-1.gif" ><B>Figure 13.1 : </B><I>The HotJava Browser running in Windows 95.</I></A>
<P>
The browser will initially load a page that was included in the
HotJava installation (in this case <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">./lib/hotjava/whats-hot.html</FONT></TT>).
To enter another address, simply click on the current document's
title. When this is done, a URL text entry box will be displayed.
HotJava supports the following Internet transfer protocols:
<UL>
<LI><TT>http</TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;HyperText
Transport Protocol. Example: <TT>http://www.javasoft.com</TT>.
<LI><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ftp</FONT></TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;File Transfer
Protocol. Example: <TT><FONT FACE="Courier"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.sun.com/pub">ftp://ftp.sun.com/pub</A></FONT></TT>.
<LI><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">mailto</FONT></TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Used
to send e-mail to a recipient using the HotJava sendmail form.
Example: <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">mailto:java@java.sun.com</FONT></TT>.
<LI><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">file</FONT></TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loads
a file on the current file system (does not access a remote Web
server). File extensions that HotJava will recognize include <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.text</FONT></TT>,
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.txt</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.java</FONT></TT>,
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.c</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.cc</FONT></TT>,

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.gif</FONT></TT>, and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.jpeg</FONT></TT>.
<LI><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">gopher</FONT></TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Archival
system that at one time was widely used on the Internet, but has
fallen out of favor with new users due to the popularity of Web
search sites such as Yahoo! and AltaVista.
</UL>
<H4>Navigating in HotJava</H4>
<P>
Figure 13.2 shows the navigation buttons available to the HotJava
user.
<P>
<A HREF="f13-2.gif" ><B>Figure 13.2 : </B><I>The HotJava navigator buttons.</I></A>
<P>
These buttons are used, from left to right, to
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>go back a page</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>go forward a page</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>go to home page</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>reload a page</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>stop a page's loading</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>show HTML errors</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
The last button bears some special mention because this feature
is unique to the HotJava Web browser. HotJava features a sophisticated
HTML parser that can detect errors in HTML pages. The last button
on the HotJava toolbar is used to display any HTML errors located
within a page.
<H4>The File Menu</H4>
<P>
The File menu contains the usual suspects: Open, Save, Print,
Send, Close, and Quit. The following list explains the File menu
options in more detail:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Clone Window</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens a new HotJava window displaying
the page that is currently loaded in HotJava. (This feature seems
to be a little buggy in the pre-Beta1 release of HotJava.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Open Page</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The equivalent of clicking on the
Document Name field to display a URL text field. This feature
is useful if a mouse isn't handy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Open Document</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays a file open dialog, which
allows the user to select a file on the local system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Save</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Saves the current page to an HTML file
on the local system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Print</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays the print dialog for setting
print options before printing the current document.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Send</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Loads the Send Mail form. (Note that this
form is actually <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">maildoc.html</FONT></TT>.
This means that this form, like most other forms within HotJava,
can be completely customized by the HotJava user.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Close</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Iconizes the HotJava application according
to the HotJava documentation; however, this feature in the pre-Beta1
release seems to serve the same function as the Quit option.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Quit</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuts down the HotJava browser.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>The Edit Menu</H4>
<P>
The Edit menu contains normal Edit options such as Cut, Copy,
and Paste. In addition, it contains more detailed environment
editing options as well. The following list explains each menu
item briefly:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Clear</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently disabled.
These items will be operational by the release of version 1.0.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Find</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enables the Find text entry field. Any
text entered into this field will be used to search the current
document.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Use Index</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Enables the Index text entry field.
Any text entered into this field will be used to search the current
document's server. This option is only enabled for documents containing
the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ISINDEX</FONT></TT> HTML tag.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Preferences</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This menu item contains several
submenus: Display, Proxies, Mail, and Applet Security.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Display</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This option will load a form that contains
several entry fields (see Figure 13.3). This form will allow the
user to change default font sizes, set a home page, and control
the display of the HotJava welcome screen.

<B>Applet Security</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most interesting
of these options. Although the security limitations of applets
have been described in some detail throughout this book, those
in fact were the <I>default</I> security limitations. HotJava
actually allows you to disable (or weaken) security precautions
and allow applets complete file access on your local machine,
as well as the ability to communicate with other computers across
the Internet (in addition to the server the applet was sent from).
Unless you have good reason for not doing so, these security settings
should be set to the following:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Network Access = Applet Host<BR>
Class Access = Restricted</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If, for some reason, you would like to configure your HotJava
browser to allow applets to read and write files on your local
drive, you can do so by modifying the Access Control List in the
HotJava properties file. This file is located in the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">./.hotjava</FONT></TT>
directory. Although the Access Control List is blank by default,
it can be modified by adding the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">acl_read</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">acl_write</FONT></TT> properties,
using the following syntax:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">acl_read=[directory_name1 or file_name1]:[directory_nameN
or file_nameN]<BR>
acl_write=[directory_name1 or file_name1]:[directory_nameN or

These security settings are completely browser-dependent and not reliant in any way on Java or the Java Virtual Machine. Developers who complain that Java is too restrictive are generally misinformed (or underinformed). In general, it is the Java <I>default</I> implementations that are designed to be restrictive (for good reason!).

<H4>The View Menu</H4>
<P>
The View menu contains a set of options that apply specifically
to the current page that is being viewed. The following list explains
each menu item briefly:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Reload Page</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This option is equivalent to hitting
the Reload button (refer to Figure 13.2). It is used to reload
a page when the current HTML page may have changed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Stop Loading</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent to hitting the Stop
button (refer to Figure 13.2). This will stop the loading of all
applets and pictures, but will not stop applets that have already
begun running.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Flush Cache</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This option will remove all files
from the HotJava cache. If a page has recently been loaded in
HotJava, it will have been stored in the cache for speedier access.
However, if that page has changed on its Web server and you would
like to load the most up-to-date version, the cache will need
to be flushed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>HTML Source</B>&#133;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allows the user to view the
HTML source of the current HTML page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>HTML Errors</B>&#133;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equivalent to selecting the
HTML Errors button. Shows form detailing all HTML style or tag
errors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Show Tags</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows all HTML tags on the current
page. Useful for beginning HTML developers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Monitor</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monitor menu contains the following
submenus: Progress, Memory, and Thread. These submenus load HTML
pages that can be used to see the current state of various operations.
Remember to hit the Shift key when selecting any of these options
to load a separate HotJava window. Otherwise, these pages will
replace the current HTML page you are viewing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Monitor Progress</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This submenu selection will
load a form that shows the progress of the current form load process.
Note that a miniature version of the progress bar is located in
the right corner of the HotJava browser window. When the progress
bar is completely filled, the loading process has been completed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Monitor Memory</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This selection will load a form
that shows a bar graph illustrating the amount of total free memory
and the amount that HotJava is currently using. At the bottom
of this page is a button that will clean up memory previously
allocated by HotJava.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Monitor Thread</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This submenu selection will load
a form showing all active threads in HotJava with their priorities
and thread groups. Available options allow the user to Raise/Lower
thread priorities as well as kill active threads (see Figure 13.4).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<A HREF="f13-4.gif" ><B>Figure 13.4 : </B><I>The HotJava Monitor Thread page.</I></A>
<H4>The Places Menu</H4>
<P>
The Places menu contains a set of operations that is used to navigate
to different Web pages. A &quot;place&quot; in HotJava refers
to a saved link to a chosen Web site. This is similar to the &quot;Favorites&quot;
list in Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. The
following list explains each menu item briefly:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Back</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Back menu item is equivalent to the
Back button (refer to Figure 13.2). It returns the main screen
to the previous document loaded in HotJava.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Forward</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Forward menu item is equivalent
to the Forward button (refer to Figure 13.2). It returns the main
screen to the next document loaded in HotJava.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Home</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home menu item is equivalent to the
Home button (refer to Figure 13.2). It returns the main screen
to the home page (also see the preceding section on the Edit/Preferences
menu selection to find out how to set the default home page).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Add Current To Places Menu</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting this item
will add the current page to the HotJava Places menu. This menu
is used to retain a list of &quot;favorite&quot; locations that
will be accessed often.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Show All Places</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Displays a page showing the
&quot;Remembered&quot; and &quot;Places&quot; lists together.
The Remembered list can only be reached by this page and is used
to store locations that won't be accessed often (unlike the Places
list, which will appear on the bottom of the View menu). Options
exist on this page to import and export lists from/to HTML and
to move locations from the Remembered list to and from the Places
list.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Show History</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shows a list of all locations visited
during the current HotJava session.

<H2><A NAME="TheNetscapeNavigator20Browser"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>The
Netscape Navigator 2.0 Browser</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
If you are like the average user of the World Wide Web, the chances
are extremely good that you currently use the Netscape Navigator
Web browser. Surveys have shown that Netscape currently controls
over 70 percent of the Web browser market. Currently, versions
of this browser are available for Windows 3.1, Windows 95/NT,
Apple Macintosh System 7, and Sun Solaris 2.3 or greater. Because
Netscape has nearly all of the features included in the HotJava
Web browser, we will not spend a great deal of time discussing
each individual feature of the Navigator (or Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, for that matter). Instead, particular attention will
be applied to these browsers' support of Java, and in particular
Java applets. Netscape supports a scripting language called JavaScript
(which is not related to Sun's Java-more on this later).
<H3><A NAME="JavaversusJavaScript">Java versus JavaScript</A>
</H3>
<P>
The release of the Netscape Navigator 2.0 browser for Solaris
and 32-bit Windows marked the first time a browser (outside of
Sun's HotJava) supported the running of Java applets. Because
of Netscape's astounding growth and the popularity of its browser,
Java received a great boost in name recognition and availability
on the desktop. Netscape uses a special version of the Java Virtual
Machine to run Java applets within the browser. You can see this
by visiting your Navigator installation directory (if you have
installed Netscape Navigator). In the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.\Program\java\classes</FONT></TT>
directory, the file <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">moz2_02.zip</FONT></TT>
resides, containing the Java <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.class</FONT></TT>
files used by Netscape. (Moz refers to Mozilla-a code name for
the Navigator project at Netscape.) These class files resemble
the classes included in the current release of the JDK, but some
may have been modified by Netscape for specialized display, performance,
and so on. What is important, however, is that Netscape had the
vision to support Java in its infancy, and is now positioned,
with its LiveConnect strategy, to provide developers with just
about everything needed to build industrial-strength Web applications
on the client side.
<P>
Both new and experienced developers are confused when forced to
differentiate between Java, HotJava, and JavaScript. By now, the
reader of this book should have a firm understanding of what Java
and HotJava are. However, JavaScript may remain somewhat of a
mystery.
<P>
JavaScript was initially introduced by Netscape as a feature known
as LiveScript. It is fully incorporated into Netscape's Navigator
2.0 browser. JavaScript is a scripting language that is used primarily
to build dynamic forms. Because Java applets generally do not
interact with other elements on HTML pages, JavaScript can be
used to tie the various elements together. Although much of the
syntax is similar to Java, there are some major differences. Most
notably, JavaScript does not allow the author to define new types
of objects. Inheritance also is not allowed. JavaScript is not
compiled. Instead, it is embedded within the <TT>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;&#133;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;</TT>
tag in an HTML form. See the Netscape home page (<TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://home.netscape.com">http://home.netscape.com</A></TT>)
for more information on JavaScript.
<H3><A NAME="NetscapeandJava">Netscape and Java</A></H3>
<P>
The Netscape browser V2.0 includes complete support for Java applets
on the Sun Solaris and Microsoft Windows 95/NT operating systems.
A later version was released that added Java applet support for
the Apple Macintosh. Currently, Java support has not been added
for Windows 3.1 because the Java Virtual Machine has not been
ported to that platform, although IBM apparently plans to do so
in the near future.
<P>
The way Netscape handles applet security is what separates its
Java support from the HotJava browser (besides sheer performance,
which appears to be better in HotJava). HotJava allows the user
to set security options, but Netscape does not. With Netscape,
Java applets are not allowed to read or write to the local file
system, and they are restricted to communicating only with the
computer from which they came. In addition, unlike HotJava users,
users of the Netscape browser can turn off applet support altogether.
This was provided to pacify users who were initially concerned
over reported Java security holes. See Figure 13.5 for Netscape's
Java options.
<P>
<A HREF="f13-5.gif" ><B>Figure 13.5 : </B><I>Netscape's Preferences dialog box.</I></A>
<P>
The Netscape Navigator has one nice feature not found in many
other Web browsers. That feature is the Java console (see Figure
13.6).
<P>
<A HREF="f13-6.gif" ><B>Figure 13.6 : </B><I>The Java console in Netscape Navigator.</I></A>
<P>
The Java console allows the user to see exactly what is being
loaded in his or her display without having to examine the HTML
source directly. This feature can come in handy when trying to
debug Java and HTML forms.
<H2><A NAME="MicrosoftsInternetExplorer30"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Microsoft's
Internet Explorer 3.0</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Fortunately for Microsoft, &quot;Web-mania&quot; hit before the
release of its Windows 95 operating system. This gave Microsoft
developers the time to create their own Web browser, named Internet
Explorer, and include it for free within their Windows 95 operating
system installation. Unfortunately for Java aficionados, neither
Internet Explorer 1.0 nor Internet Explorer 2.0 supported Java
applets (nor JavaScript, but as we've seen, that's another topic
entirely!). Internet Explorer 3.0 is promising Java applet support
as well as support for a host of other semi-related technologies
such as Visual Basic Script (VBScript), JavaScript, and Microsoft's
ActiveX controls (see Figure 13.7 to view the Internet Explorer
application).
<P>
<A HREF="f13-7.gif" ><B>Figure 13.7 : </B><I>Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3.0.</I></A>
<P>
Although the current beta of Internet Explorer 3.0 does not yet
support Java applets, we assume that this support will be provided
by the final release. What is more interesting with this product
is the ActiveX technology and how it applies to Java programmers.
<H3><A NAME="JavaandActiveX">Java and ActiveX</A></H3>
<P>
For developers who thought that following the Java technologies
alone was bewildering enough, ActiveX is sure to add an entirely
new level of decision-making complexity. In a nutshell, Microsoft's
ActiveX technology may be more familiar to developers when called
by its old name: OLE (Object Linking and Embedding). OLE was renamed
to ActiveX to more accurately represent the active, Internet-aware,
distributed OLE that will soon be upon us. For Web developers,
the most important ActiveX subset to understand may be ActiveX
controls (formerly known as OCX controls). ActiveX controls are
programming objects that encapsulate an object's properties, methods,
and events. These controls currently are supported by nearly all
popular Windows development tools including Visual Basic, Visual
C++, Borland C++, Borland Delphi, Powersoft PowerBuilder, and
many others. (ActiveX also is being ported to other platforms
including the Apple Macintosh.)
<P>
What is new about the ActiveX control technology is that the Microsoft
Internet Explorer 3.0 browser will allow these controls to be
run within a Web page just as Java applets are. In fact, these
controls could actually be running side by side with other Java
applets. How is this done? Microsoft is developing a special Java
Virtual Machine that will expose Java applets running within a
browser as ActiveX controls. Any application using the Microsoft
Java Virtual Machine will acquire this capability.
<P>
Microsoft envisions an environment where scripting languages such
as VBScript and JavaScript will be used to tie all of these components
together into dynamic, fully functional Web pages. Sounds great,
right? Because Internet-aware ActiveX controls are so new, it
remains to be seen whether developers will get excited and support
them with the fervor currently directed toward Java. The remainder
of this section will point out some differences between Java and
ActiveX and leave it to the software market to sort out the better
of the two.
<H4>Security</H4>
<P>
Because of the nature of the Internet, no large-scale development
effort can be undertaken that does not take security into account
at every level. The designers of Java and ActiveX have both provided
security features in their technologies. However, they have arrived
at very different results. As explained throughout this book,
Java applets are treated as untrusted programs running within
trusted environments (a restriction known as &quot;sand boxing&quot;).
They can only be written using the Java language, which was designed
from the ground up to be a secure language. ActiveX controls,
on the other hand, are primarily created using C++, although Visual
Basic 5.0 is rumored to provide support for ActiveX control creation.
Whatever way they are created, obviously the languages used give
programmers a way around Java's strict security limits. Microsoft
is attempting to solve this problem through the use of secure
digital signatures.
<P>
Because they recognize that the momentum behind Java is somewhat
unavoidable, Microsoft plans to provide Java applets with the
capability of calling remote ActiveX objects throughout the Internet,
which violates Java applets' security rules. Microsoft realizes
this and is promoting the concept of &quot;code signing&quot;
to verify the authenticity and security of downloaded ActiveX
controls and Java applets. Developers should realize that these
extensions have advantages and disadvantages. In the meantime,
Sun is encouraging developers to avoid all proprietary extensions
to Java.<BR>

Extending the base Java class libraries with new classes is not considered a proprietary extension. This is what object-oriented programming is all about! However, custom-izations of the Java Virtual Machine and Java <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.class</FONT></TT> file formats are considered proprietary extensions.

<H4>Platform Independence</H4>
<P>
At the time this book is being written, the Internet Explorer
3.0 (Windows-only) browser is the only application that will support
the running of ActiveX controls within an HTML page. This means
that any ActiveX controls you create will be restricted to a 32-bit
Windows-only audience. In smaller corporate intranet settings
where the audience is limited and known, this restriction may
not be a limiting factor. However, if your product will be displayed
on the Web to a wide audience, platform independence is a huge
bonus.
<H2><A NAME="Summary"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Summary</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
Within a year of Java's introduction in 1995, it has seen unprecedented
growth. The three Web browsers studied in this chapter all have
the capability of running Java applets. It is interesting to note
the difference in philosophies behind the creation of each of
these three products. In the near future, the HotJava 1.0 product
should be released with a complete class library of reusable Java
components. This library will include components capable of displaying
Web pages and will greatly ease the creation of &quot;Internet-aware&quot;
applications. Also due for release is Netscape Navigator 3.0.
This application will provide improved performance for Java applets
(including a just-in-time compiler licensed from Borland). The
release of the Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 will mark the availability
of the first browser to support both Java and ActiveX.
<P>
Although this chapter provides a good introduction to Web browsers
for Java programmers, it is recommended that you visit the Web
sites for the respective companies for the latest and greatest
information on their browsers. Here are the addresses:
