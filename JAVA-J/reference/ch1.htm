This chapter introduces Java and points out some of its strengths.
It describes how programming in Java is different from programming
in any other language and how you can take advantage of these
differences to create exciting new applications. Also included
in this chapter are high-level overviews of the Java language
and the Java runtime environment. By the time you complete this
chapter, you will have a good introduction to what Java is and
what it can do for you.
<H2><A NAME="WhatIsJava"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>What Is Java?</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
Java was developed at Sun Microsystems. Work on Java originally
began with the goal of creating a platform-independent language
and operating system for consumer electronics. The original intent
was to use C++, but as work progressed in this direction, the
Java developers realized that they would be better served by creating
their own language rather than extending C++. The effort toward
consumer electronics led the Java team, then known as FirstPerson,
Inc., toward developing hardware and software for the delivery
of video-on-demand with Time-Warner.
<P>
Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, depending on your perspective),
Time-Warner selected Silicon Graphics as the vendor for its video-on-demand
project. This setback left the FirstPerson team with an interesting
piece of software (Java) but no market in which to place it. Eventually,
the natural synergies of the Java language and the World Wide
Web (WWW)  were noticed, and Java found a market.
<P>
What we know today as Java is both a programming language and
an environment for executing programs written in the Java language.
Unlike traditional compilers, which convert source code into machine-level
instructions, the Java compiler translates Java source code into
instructions that are interpreted by the runtime Java Virtual
Machine. So, unlike languages like C and C++, on which Java is
based, Java is an interpreted language.
<P>
Although most of the current excitement and anticipated use of
Java are related to the Internet, and the World Wide Web in particular,
Java did not begin as an Internet project. Because of this, Java
is suitable for many general-purpose programming tasks and, in
fact, many of the Java tools themselves are written in Java. It
is a compiler development custom that a language has come of age
when its compiler can be written in the language. According to
this custom, the Java language has come of age.
<H3><A NAME="JavaasanInternetLanguage">Java as an Internet Language</A>
</H3>
<P>
The excitement over Java as an Internet development language is
related to its capability to solve two key problems with Internet
content:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Currently, the WWW content is passive
and static.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Delivery of WWW content is dependent on
the configuration of each user's Web browser.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
Although these two problems are related, each warrants independent
consideration.
<H4>Passive and Static Content</H4>
<P>
Current WWW pages are very good at conveying some types of information
but are inadequate for conveying other types. In particular, WWW
pages excel at conveying passive, static information. This type
of information changes infrequently (static) and doesn't change
in response to user interactions with it (passive).
<P>
For example, many Web pages enable you to enter a company's name
or stock ticker symbol and receive current price quotes. One of

the best is the APL Quote Server located at <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://qs.secapl.com/cgi-bin/qs">http://qs.secapl.com/cgi-bin/qs</A></TT>
and shown in Figure 1.1. This page is static because it isn't
automatically updated with new quotes while the page is being
browsed. It is passive because the user cannot interact with the
page, other than to request to see a similar page.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-1.gif" ><B>Figure 1.1 : </B><I>Retrieving passive, static stock prices.</I></A>
<P>
Current Web development technologies excel at displaying this
type of page. Much of human communication is passive, static,
or both. A highway billboard is a perfect example of a conventional
means of communication that is both passive and static. Just as
not all billboards will go the way of Burma Shave, not all passive,
static WWW content needs to become active and dynamic (the opposites
of passive and static).
<P>
However, Java is an enabling technology that allows for the creation
of more powerful pages. Continuing with the example of a page
that shows the price of a stock at a given point in time, you
could use Java to create a page that shows a graph of a stock's
price over time and have that graph continue to update in real
time while you browse the page. This is where Java comes in-because
Java is a full-featured programming language, Web pages like this
become much more feasible. Sun Microsystems has created a page
that does exactly this. It is located at
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://java.sun.com/java.sun.com/applets/applets/StockDemo/index.html">http://java.sun.com/java.sun.com/applets/applets/StockDemo/index.html</A></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
and is shown in Figure 1.2.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-2.gif" ><B>Figure 1.2 : </B><I>A Java version of a stock price Web page.</I></A>
<P>
On the Java WWW page shown in Figure 1.2, there is a line of stock
ticker symbols and prices that scrolls across the top of the screen.
Below that are graphs for three different companies' stocks. Each
of these graphs is updated every five seconds based on the latest
trades. (The page shown in Figure 1.2 is just an illustration
and the prices of the NEATO company are randomly generated.)
<H4>Freedom from Browser Configuration</H4>
<P>
In the pre-Java world of the Web, as a developer of Web content
and pages, you could not count on your users having a specific
browser configuration. You could create a Web page with leading
edge graphics, sound, and real-time multimedia. Unfortunately,
if any of the visitors to your Web site did not configure a browser
add-on to handle the latest whiz-bang features, these users wouldn't
get the full impact of your site.
<P>
Just as the prior section showed that Java enabled applications
to go beyond passive, static content, Java again serves as an
enabling technology. In this case, Java enables you, as a Web
developer, to create Web pages that will be delivered consistently
to all users with a Java-enabled browser.
<P>
Not only does Java free you from concerns about how users have
configured their Web browsers, it also frees you from concerns
about which hardware and operating system platform they are using.
Because Java source code is interpreted, if a Java interpreter
exists for a specific hardware and operating system platform,
you can write programs with the knowledge that they will be usable
on that platform.
<H4>How It Works</H4>
<P>
Now that you've read about some of the benefits of using Java
for World Wide Web applications, it's time to take a quick look
behind the scenes at how this is accomplished. Figure 1.3 shows
how Java source code is transferred over the Internet. This figure
shows a host computer that is storing the source code to a Java
program. When a user on a local computer uses the Internet to
connect to this host with a Java-enabled browser, the source is
transferred from the host computer to the local computer.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-3.gif" ><B>Figure 1.3 : </B><I>Transfer of Java source code over the Internet.</I></A>
<P>
Implemented within the Java-enabled browser is the Java Virtual
Machine, which interprets the Java source code. The Java Virtual
Machine acts on an input byte stream and converts it into the
desired program actions. In the case of Java, the byte stream
is a sequence of opcodes (operation codes) and operands. Each
pair of opcode and operand is read by the interpreter, and the
specified action is performed. This is illustrated in Figure 1.4.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-4.gif" ><B>Figure 1.4 :</B><I> Program behavior is created by the Java Virtual machine's interpretation of byte stream.</I></A>
<H3><A NAME="JavaasaGeneralPurposeLanguage">Java as a General-Purpose
Language</A></H3>
<P>
Of course, the use of Java extends beyond the Web, and there is
much to recommend Java as a general-purpose development language.
You've already seen that Java is completely portable to a variety
of hardware platforms and operating systems. In this section,
you'll learn about some of Java's attributes that make it a desirable
general-purpose language.
<P>
For example, because Java borrows much of its syntax and many
of its concepts from C and C++, there is a preexisting pool of
programmers who could quickly learn Java. However, Java goes far
beyond being a mere derivative of C++. It adds to C++ in the areas
of automatic memory management and language-level support for
multithreaded applications. On the other hand, Java remains easier
to learn and simpler to use than C++ because of those C++ features
that were left out of Java: multiple inheritance, pointers, and
the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">goto</FONT></TT> statement, among
others.
<P>
Because implementations of the Java Virtual Machine can be very
efficient, it is possible for Java programs to run almost as quickly
as C++ programs. This is a key feature in convincing developers
that Java is a viable language for non-Internet development. Because
of Java's strengths as an Internet language, many of these same
strengths apply when Java is used as a language for client-server
development. It is very likely that as corporations do more and
more Internet development in Java, they will begin to apply these
same Java developers to their client-server projects. Java's strengths
in terms of network awareness, security, portability, and performance
make it ideally suited for corporate client-server development,
as well as Internet development.
<H3><A NAME="ApplicationsandApplets">Applications and Applets</A>
</H3>
<P>
In discussing Java programs, it has become standard to refer to
Java programs that are embedded in another language as <I>applets</I>
and to stand-alone programs as <I>applications</I>. For example,
when you use Java to augment a World Wide Web page, the Java code
is embedded within HTML code. Therefore, this is referred to as
an applet. On the other hand, a Java program that is not embedded
within HTML or any other language and can stand on its own is
referred to as an application.
<P>
Of course, there is a subtle implication here that applications
are larger (and, therefore, presumably more complex) than applets.
However, this is not necessarily true. Applications and applets
alike can range from simple one-class programs to programs with
hundreds of classes. The implication that an applet is somehow
less than an application is unfortunately a connotation it is
necessary to live with in an otherwise valid distinction.
<H2><A NAME="FeaturesoftheJavaLanguage"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Features
of the Java Language</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Having seen that Java is equally suited as a language for development
both on and off the Internet, it's time to look more closely at
the Java language itself. The creators of Java at Sun Microsystems
have defined the Java language as &quot;a simple, object-oriented,
distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture-neutral,
portable, high-performance, multithreaded, and dynamic language.&quot;
Well, they managed to fit all of the important 1990s buzzwords
into one sentence, but we need to look more closely at Java to
see if they managed to fit all of these concepts into one language.
<H3><A NAME="Simple">Simple</A></H3>
<P>
If you have experience with any object-oriented language, especially
C++, you probably will find Java to be easier than your high school
prom date. Because Java started out as C++ but has had certain
features removed, it is certainly a simpler language than C++.
<P>
The simplicity of Java is enhanced by its similarities to C and
C++. Because many of today's current programmers, especially those
likely to consider using Java, are experienced in at least C and
probably C++, Java is instantly familiar to these programmers.
<P>
Java has simplified C++ programming by both adding features beyond
those found in C++ and by removing some of the features that make
C++ a complicated and difficult language to master. Java is simple
because it consists of only three primitive data types-numbers,
Boolean types, and arrays. Everything else in Java is a class.
For example, strings are true objects, not just arrays of characters.
Similarly, arrays in the Java language are first-class objects,
not just memory allocations and runtime representations.
<P>
Java offers additional simplifications over C++. The ubiquitous
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">goto</FONT></TT> statement has been removed.
Operator overloading, a frequent source of confusion during the
maintenance of C++ programs, is not allowed in Java. Unlike C
and C++, Java has no preprocessor. This means that the concepts
behind <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">#define</FONT></TT> and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">typedef</FONT></TT>
are not necessary in Java. Java reduces the redundancy of C++
by removing structures and unions from the language. These are
both just poor cousins of a full-fledged class and are superfluous
in a cohesively designed language. Of course, they were necessary
in C++ because it was important for early C++ translators and
then compilers to be able to correctly interpret the existing
C code that relied on these features.
<P>
The most important C++ feature left out of Java is the capability
to directly manipulate memory addresses through the use of pointers.
Pointers are one of the cornerstones of the C and C++ languages,
and it would be difficult to write many programs in these languages
without using pointers. However, as any C or C++ programmer will
admit, pointers are also a significant source of problems and
debugging time in C and C++ programs. Pointers can accidentally
be set to point to the wrong thing, causing unexpected behavior
including crashes. Pointers also can be used to store allocated
memory. If the allocated memory isn't freed, or released back
to the operating system, then the program will gradually leak
memory, until it eventually runs out. An entire set of commercial
products, such as the Bounds Checker products, has come into existence
to help programmers identify these types of pointer-related problems.
Java simplifies this by completely removing pointers from the
language and using a handle-based solution instead.
<P>
Of course, if all Java did was remove syntax from C++, it would
be a poor compiler instead of an exciting new language. Java goes
well beyond C++ by adding some important features. One of the
most important is automatic memory management, usually known as
<I>garbage collection</I>. Garbage collection is really just a
blue-collar term that means that you don't need to free memory
that you allocate-the Java Virtual Machine takes care of doing
this for you. If you're a C or C++ programmer, or have ever had
to track down memory leaks in another language, just imagine how
nice your life could be if you never have to do it again. You
would have time for walks on the beach, barbecued turkey burgers
on holiday weekends, and romantic evenings with your spouse.
<P>
Java goes beyond C++ in a variety of other ways, as well. For
example, Java includes language-level support for writing <I>multithreaded</I>
programs. A multithreaded program is one that is written such
that it performs more than one task at a time. For example, consider
the stock price Web page shown earlier in Figure 1.2. One thread
in the program to create this page may be constantly retrieving
quotes from the stock exchange while another thread searches various
news databases for breaking stories about the stocks being monitored.
Although you can definitely write this program in a traditional
single-threaded manner, the ability to use multiple threads can
make it simpler to write and maintain.
<H3><A NAME="ObjectOriented">Object-Oriented</A></H3>
<P>
Of course, Java is object-oriented. In fact, in the mid-1990s,
it's hard to imagine someone developing a new language and declaring
it the greatest new thing without it being object-oriented. In
its approach to object-orientation, Java follows more closely
along the lines of languages such as SmallTalk than C++. Except
for its primitive data types, everything in Java is an object.
In contrast, C++ is much more lax in that you are entirely free
to mix and match object-oriented code (classes) and procedural
code (functions). In Java, this is not the case. There are no
global functions in Java: all functions are invoked through an
object.
<P>
Java's support for object-orientation does not include multiple
inheritance. The designers of the language felt that the complexity
introduced by multiple inheritance was not justified by its benefits.
<P>
Java classes are comprised of methods and variables. <I>Class
methods</I> are the functions that an object of the class can
respond to. <I>Class variables</I> are the data that define the
state of an object. In Java, methods and variables can be declared
as <I>private</I>, <I>protected</I>, or <I>public</I>. Private
methods and variables are not accessible outside of the class.
Protected members are accessible to subclasses of the class, but
not to other classes. Finally, public methods and variables are
accessible to any class.
<P>
Classes in Java can be defined as abstract. An abstract class
is a class that collects generic state and behavioral information.
More specific classes are defined as subclasses of the abstract
class and are used to define actual, specific entities. For example,
software in use at a pet store may have an abstract class named
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Pet</FONT></TT>. This class would store
information that is common to all pets-birthdate, cost, sale price,
date received, and so on. Derived from the abstract <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Pet</FONT></TT>
class could be classes such as <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Dog</FONT></TT>,
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Cat</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Bird</FONT></TT>,
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Fish</FONT></TT>. Each of these classes
can augment the abstract class as necessary. For example, a member
variable called <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">WaterType</FONT></TT>
(salt or fresh) would be necessary in <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Fish</FONT></TT>.
Because <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">WaterType</FONT></TT> would be
meaningless for <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Dogs</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Cats</FONT></TT>,
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Birds</FONT></TT>, it is not part
of the abstract implementation of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Pet</FONT></TT>.
<H3><A NAME="Distributed">Distributed</A></H3>
<P>
Java facilitates the building of distributed applications by a
collection of classes for use in networked applications. By using
Java's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) class, an application can
easily access a remote server. Classes also are provided for establishing
socket-level connections.
<H3><A NAME="Interpreted">Interpreted</A></H3>
<P>
Because Java is interpreted, once the Java interpreter has been
ported to a specific machine, that machine can instantly run the
growing body of Java applications. As an example of the usefulness
of this, imagine a hypothetical chip manufacturer, Outtel, that
has just finished its newest CPU chip. This new chip, named the
Zentium, serves as the foundation of a new line of computers being
marketed toward Zen Buddhist monasteries. Once Outtel ports the
Java interpreter to work on the Zentium, the new machine will
be able to run all of the Java development utilities-the compiler,
the debugger, and so on. Contrast this with a traditional language.
If Outtel wants to release a C++ compiler with its new computer
it must port, or create from scratch, the compiler, the debugger,
the runtime library, and so on.
<P>
Also, when using an interpreter, programmers are freed from some
of the concerns of intermodule dependencies. You no longer have
to maintain a &quot;make&quot; file that is sometimes as complicated
as the hardest part of your program.
<P>
Another advantage is that the time-consuming edit-compile-link-test
cycle is broken. Without the compile and link steps, working in
an interpreted environment is a much simpler edit-test cycle.
Even with today's quick C++ compilers, it is not uncommon for
a complete recompile and relink of a large program to be measured
in hours and take the better part of a day. Without having to
wait for lengthy compiles and links, Java promotes prototyping
and easier debugging.
<H3><A NAME="Robust">Robust</A></H3>
<P>
The designers of Java anticipated that it would be used to solve
some very complex programming problems. Writing a distributed,
multithreaded program that can run on a variety of operating systems
with a variety of processors is not a simple task. To do it successfully,
you need all the help your programming language can offer you.
With this in mind, Java was created as a strongly typed language.
Data type issues and problems are resolved at compile-time, and
implicit casts of a variable from one type to another are not
allowed.
<P>
Memory management has been simplified in Java in two ways. First,
Java does not support direct pointer manipulation or arithmetic.
This makes it impossible for a Java program to overwrite memory
or corrupt data. Second, Java uses runtime garbage collection
instead of explicit freeing of memory. In languages like C++,
it is necessary to delete or free memory once the program has
finished with it. Java follows the lead of languages such as LISP
and SmallTalk by providing automatic support for freeing memory
that has been allocated but is no longer used.
<H3><A NAME="Secure">Secure</A></H3>
<P>
Closely related to Java's robustness is its focus on security.
Because Java does not use pointers to directly reference memory
locations, as is prevalent in C and C++, Java has a great deal
of control over the code that exists within the Java environment.
<P>
It was anticipated that Java applications would run on the Internet
and that they could dynamically incorporate or execute code found
at remote locations on the Internet. Because of this, the developers
of Java hypothesized the existence of a hostile Java compiler
that would generate Java byte codes with the intent of bypassing
Java's runtime security. This led to the concept of a byte-code
verifier. The byte-code verifier examines all incoming code to
ensure that the code plays by the rules and is safe to execute.
In addition to other properties, the byte code verifier ensures
the following:
<UL>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>No pointers are forged.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>No illegal object casts are performed.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>There will be no operand stack overflows
or underflows.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>All parameters passed to functions are
of the proper types.</FONT>
<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Rules regarding private, protected, </FONT>and
public class membership are followed.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="ArchitectureNeutral">Architecture-Neutral</A></H3>
<P>
Back in the dark ages of the early 1980s, there was tremendous
variety in desktop personal computers. You could buy computers
from Apple, Commodore, Radio Shack, Atari, and eventually even
from IBM. Additionally, every machine came with its own very different
operating system. Because developing software is such a time-consuming
task, very little of the software developed for use on one machine
was ever ported and then released for use on a different machine.
<P>
In many regards, this situation has improved with the acceptance
of Windows, the Apple Macintosh, and UNIX variations as the only
valid personal computer options. However, it is still not easy
to write an application that can be used on Windows NT, UNIX,
and a Macintosh. And it's getting more complicated with the move
of Windows NT to non-Intel CPU architectures.
<P>
A number of commercially available source code libraries (for
example, Zinc, ZApp, and XVT) attempt to achieve application portability.
These libraries attempt this by focusing on either a lowest common
denominator among the operating systems or by creating a common
core API (Application Programming Interface).
<P>
Java takes a different approach. Because the Java compiler creates
byte code instructions that are subsequently interpreted by the
Java interpreter, architecture neutrality is achieved in the implementation
of the Java interpreter for each new architecture.
<H3><A NAME="Portable">Portable</A></H3>
<P>
In addition to being architecture-neutral, Java code is also portable.
It was an important design goal of Java that it be portable so
that as new architectures (due to hardware, operating system,
or both) are developed, the Java environment could be ported to
them.
<P>
In Java, all primitive types (integers, longs, floats, doubles,
and so on) are of defined sizes, regardless of the machine or
operating system on which the program is run. This is in direct
contrast to languages like C and C++ that leave the sizes of primitive
types up to the compiler and developer.
<P>
Additionally, Java is portable because the compiler itself is
written in Java and the runtime environment is written in POSIX-compliant
C.
<H3><A NAME="HighPerformance">High-Performance</A></H3>
<P>
For all but the simplest or most infrequently used applications,
performance is always a consideration. It is no surprise, then,
to discover that achieving high performance was one of the initial
design goals of the Java developers. A Java application will not
achieve the performance of a fully compiled language such as C
or C++. However, for most applications, including graphics-intensive
ones such as are commonly found on the World Wide Web, the performance
of Java is more than adequate. For some applications, there may
be no discernible difference in performance between C++ and Java.
<P>
Many of the early adopters of C++ were concerned about the possibility
of performance degradation as they converted their programs from
C to C++. However, many C++ early adopters discovered that, although
a C program will outperform a C++ program in many cases, the additional
development time and effort don't justify the minimal performance
gains. Of course, because we're not all programming in assembly
language, there must be some amount of performance we're willing
to trade for faster development.
<P>
It is very likely that early experiences with Java will follow
these same lines. Although a Java application may not be able
to keep up with a C++ application, it will normally be fast enough,
and Java may enable you to do things you couldn't do with C++.
<H3><A NAME="Multithreaded">Multithreaded</A></H3>
<P>
Writing a computer program that only does a single thing at a
time is an artificial constraint that we've lived with in most
programming languages. With Java, we no longer have to live with
this limitation. Support for multiple, synchronized threads is
built directly into the Java language and runtime environment.
<P>
Synchronized threads are extremely useful in creating distributed,
network-aware applications. Such an application may be communicating
with a remote server in one thread while interacting with a user
in a different thread.
<H3><A NAME="Dynamic">Dynamic</A></H3>
<P>
Because it is interpreted, Java is an extremely dynamic language.
At runtime, the Java environment can extend itself by linking
in classes that may be located on remote servers on a network
(for example, the Internet). This is a tremendous advantage over
a language like C++ that links classes in prior to runtime.
<P>
In C++, every time member variables or functions are added to
a class, it is necessary to recompile that class and then all
additional code that references that class. Of course, the problem
is exacerbated by the fact that you need to remember to recompile
the files that reference the changed class. Using make files reduces
the problem, but for large, complex systems, it doesn't eliminate
it.
<P>
Java addresses this problem by deferring it to runtime. At runtime,
the Java interpreter performs name resolution while linking in
the necessary classes. The Java interpreter is also responsible
for determining the placement of objects in memory. These two
features of the Java interpreter solve the problem of changing
the definition of a class used by other classes. Because name
lookup and resolution are performed only the first time a name
is encountered, only minimal performance overhead is added.
<H2><A NAME="TheJavaTools"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>The Java
Tools</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Of course, in order to write Java applications or applets, you
need more than a language-you need the tools that let you write,
test, and debug your programs. This section gives a very high-level
overview of the various Java tools that come with the Java Developer's
Kit. (For instructions on downloading the Java Developer's Kit
from Sun Microsystems, <A HREF="ch2.htm" >see Chapter 2</A>, &quot;Installing
Java.&quot;)
<H3><A NAME="Compiler">Compiler</A></H3>
<P>
There is, of course, a Java compiler, named javac. The Java compiler
takes input source code files (these files typically have the
extension <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.java</FONT></TT>) and converts
them into compiled byte code files. The Java compiler is discussed
in more detail in <A HREF="ch9.htm" >Chapter 9</A>, &quot;javac:
The Java Compiler.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="Interpreter">Interpreter</A></H3>
<P>
The Java interpreter, known eponymously as java, can be used to
execute Java applications. The interpreter translates byte codes
directly into program actions.
<H3><A NAME="Debugger">Debugger</A></H3>
<P>
The Java debugger, jdb, enables you to debug your Java classes.
Unfortunately, the Java debugger is a throwback to the pre-GUI
debugger dark ages of programming. The Java debugger is a command-line
debugger that is enough to make you wish for even the 1988 version
of CodeView. However, you can use the jdb to set breakpoints,
inspect objects and variables, and monitor threads.
<P>
The Java debugger is discussed in more detail in <A HREF="ch15.htm" >Chapter 15</A>,
&quot;jdb: The Java Debugger.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="Disassembler">Disassembler</A></H3>
<P>
One of the basic tenets of object-oriented programming is that
programmers unfamiliar with a class need only concern themselves
with the public interface of that class. If you want to use a
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Queue</FONT></TT> or <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Stack</FONT></TT>
class, you shouldn't be concerned with (or need to be concerned
with) how this class has been written. Whether it uses a linked
list, a statically sized array, or a dynamic array shouldn't influence
whether and how you use the class.
<P>
Because you should be interested only in the public interface
of a class, the Java Developer's Kit includes a disassembler,
javap, that can be used to display the public interface, both
methods and variables, of a class. Additionally, the Java disassembler
includes options to display private members or to display the
actual byte codes for the class's methods. This last option can
be particularly useful if you want to achieve a greater understanding
of the byte codes used by the Java interpreter.
<H3><A NAME="HeaderFileGenerator">Header File Generator</A></H3>
<P>
Because Java is a new language and must fit in a world dominated
by C and C++, included in Java is the capability to use native
C code within a Java class. One of the steps in doing this is
using the Java header file generator, javah. The process for doing
this is fully described in <A HREF="ch19.htm" >Chapter 19</A>,
&quot;Extending Your Programs with Native Methods.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="JavaDoc">JavaDoc</A></H3>
<P>
As programmers, we've fought it in every way possible. Unfortunately,
there is no longer any excuse for not documenting our source code.
Using the JavaDoc utility provided with the Java Developers Kit,
you can easily generate documentation in the form of HTML files.
To do this, you embed special comments and tags in your source
code and then process your code through JavaDoc. All of the on-line
Java API documentation was created with JavaDoc.
<P>
JavaDoc is described in detail in <A HREF="ch16.htm" >Chapter 16</A>,
&quot;Using JavaDoc to Document Your Program.&quot;
<H3><A NAME="AppletViewer">Applet Viewer</A></H3>
<P>
If you will be writing Java applets, you will definitely want
to become familiar with the Applet Viewer. This small program
provides a real Java environment for testing applets. It loads
the HTML file in which the applet has been embedded and displays
the application in a browser-like window, as shown in Figure 1.5.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-5.gif" ><B>Figure 1.5 : </B><I>A bar chart applet being run in the Applet Vicwer.</I></A>
<P>
In Figure 1.5, the Java class <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Chart.class</FONT></TT>
has been loaded by the Applet Viewer and is displayed on the screen.
This is a simple applet for displaying a four-line bar chart.
One nice feature of the Applet Viewer is that you can easily view
the HTML tags or parameters that control the applet. By selecting
Tag from the Applet menu, you can see all of the tags, as shown
in Figure 1.6.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-6.gif" ><B>Figure 1.6 : </B><I>HTML tags used to create the bar chart applet.</I></A>
<P>
In this illustration, you can see that the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">c1
value</FONT></TT> was set to 10 and the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">c2
value</FONT></TT> was set to 20. By looking back at Figure 1.5,
you can see that these were the values used to draw the top two
bars. The Applet Viewer is described in more detail in <A HREF="ch11.htm" >Chapter 11</A>,
&quot;Using the Applet Viewer.&quot;
<H2><A NAME="JavaEnabledBrowsers"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Java-Enabled
Browsers</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Of course, if you plan to use Java to develop Internet content,
you need to have a Java-enabled browser. Not only do you need
a Java-enabled browser, so will your prospective users if your
project is to be a success. Fortunately, you (and your prospective
users!) are in luck. Java-enabled browsers are available from
both Sun Microsystems and Netscape.
<H3><A NAME="HotJava">HotJava</A></H3>
<P>
HotJava is the name given by Sun Microsystems to its Java World
Wide Web browser. HotJava is written entirely in Java. Although
HotJava's purpose is to view applets embedded in HTML documents,
it serves as the best example to date of what can be done in a
Java application. The main screen for HotJava appears in Figure
1.7.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-7.gif" ><B>Figure 1.7 : </B><I>The main screen  of the HotJava browser.</I></A>
<P>
HotJava presents the user with a very clean and simple interface.
It has a series of menus across the top and a single set of six
buttons that can be used for navigation. In order, these buttons
will move to the prior page, move to the next page, move to the
home page, reload the current page, stop loading a page, and view
HTML errors.
<P>
As an example of the type of Web content that Java enables, consider
Figure 1.8. This figure shows a Web page with two adjacent illustrations.
The illustration on the left is an x-ray with a horizontal indicator
through it. The illustration on the right is a cross-section through
the left illustration at the position indicated by the horizontal
line. The 14 enclosed in a circle and connected to the line indicates
that the line is at position 14.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-8.gif" ><B>Figure 1.8 : </B><I>Sample Java Web content viewed through HotJava.</I></A>
<P>
This page is both active and dynamic because a user can select
the line and move it to a different location on the left illustration.
This will cause a different cross-section to be displayed, as
shown in Figure 1.9.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-9.gif" ><B>Figure 1.9 : </B><I>Moving the selection line to view a different crossection in Hotjava.</I></A>
<P>
Because HotJava includes a full Java Virtual Machine, it is possible
to create Web pages with active, dynamic content as shown in this
example.
<H3><A NAME="Netscape">Netscape</A></H3>
<P>
Of course, HotJava is not your only choice for a Java-enabled
Web browser. Beginning with version 2.0 of its Navigator browser,
Netscape includes Java compatibility. The inclusion of Java support
in a Netscape browser is significant because Netscape is the dominant
browser vendor. With Java support included in Navigator, Java
applets are within reach of most World Wide Web users. An example
of using Netscape Navigator to view a Java Web page is shown in
Figure 1.10.
<P>
<A HREF="f1-10.gif" ><B>Figure 1.10 : </B><I>A java-enabled stock quote page viewed with Netscape Navigator.</I></A>
<P>
For comparison purposes, Figure 1.10 is the same page that was
displayed by HotJava in <BR>
Figure 1.2.
<H2><A NAME="Summary"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Summary</FONT></A>
</H2>
<P>
By now, you've gotten a good overview of what Java is and what
you can do with it. You've learned how it can be used to create
Web-based applets that move beyond the passive, static content
of current Web pages. You've also learned that Java is a general-purpose
language that can be used for stand-alone applications that have
nothing to do with the Internet. 
<P>
In this chapter, you also examined Sun Microsystems's claim that
Java is &quot;a simple, object-oriented, distributed, interpreted,
robust, secure, architecture-neutral, portable, high-performance,
multithreaded, and dynamic language.&quot; Each of these characteristics
was examined and found to be more than just marketing hype. Finally,
this chapter gave you a high-level overview of the tools that
are included with the Java Developer's Kit and of two Java-enabled
Web browsers. 
<P>
In the next chapter, you will learn how to install Java, including
how to download the latest version of the Java Developer's Kit
from the World Wide Web.
