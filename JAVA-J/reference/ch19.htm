The Java Virtual Machine provides sophisticated capabilities for
creating user interfaces, performing Internet and WWW accesses,
and for general-purpose programming. Unfortunately, the Java Virtual
Machine has some (deliberate) limitations. First and foremost,
the JVM only supports functionality that applies to many platforms.
That means that unaided Java applications cannot take full advantage
of their host platforms. The Java development team also introduced
some artificial limitations in the interest of security. For the
most part, these restrictions are not onerous. In fact, users
can have a relatively high degree of confidence that Java applications
and applets are not malicious. Without such assurances, the World
Wide Web community would surely have revolted at the notion of
self-downloading, self-executing code in a Web page. Just imagine
the prospect of a cross-platform virus that attaches itself to
Web pages! In some cases, however, these benevolent restrictions
prevent applications from making the most of Java.
<P>
Consider these situations:

<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>You have a large, specialized library

<LI><FONT COLOR=#000000>Your application must use a non-standard

Native methods can solve all of these problems. A Java class can
declare a native method to indicate that the actual code for the
method is provided in another language. (At present, native methods
must be implemented in C. Support for other languages is in the
works.) That code is compiled to the native machine code of your
particular platform, hence the name &quot;native method.&quot;
Before it can be used by the Java Virtual Machine, the compiled
code must be linked into a dynamically loadable library suitable
for use on the target platform. Finally, the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">DLL</FONT></TT>
or <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">.so</FONT></TT> file must be installed
on the target computer.
<P>
There are two parts to every native method, the Java declaration
and the &quot;native&quot; implementation. As you do with all
other methods, you declare a native method inside a Java class.
Native methods can be final, static, or synchronized. They can
throw exceptions and be inherited (unless they are final, of course).
Because the implementation is compiled for the target platform,
it can take full advantage of the capabilities of that platform.
Native methods provide a powerful means of extending the Java
Virtual Machine.
<P>
You have probably guessed by now that native methods are not cross-platform
by nature. Your native methods will be as portable as the C code
in which you write them and the APIs they call. Because the most
common reason for creating native methods is to use a platform-specific
API, native methods tend not to be very portable.
<P>
Because the dynamically loadable library must be installed on
the target machine <I>prior</I> to execution of the Java classes
that need it, you will have to face all the issues of software
distribution and configuration management. On the other hand,
native methods can only be called from Java applications, which
have to be distributed and installed themselves. So, the added
difficulty of distributing multiple native-method libraries should
not pose too great a hurdle.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here are some questions to ask yourself before you decide to use native methods:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
<LI>Are you writing a full-blown application instead of an applet? Some Web browsers will prevent applets from calling native methods not distributed in the base classes. In some cases, the browser allows the user to enable native method calls from applets. Bear in mind that many users will be reluctant to deliberately short-circuit security features.
<LI>Can you manage the platform-specific code? Because the native methods are compiled for each platform, you will encounter significant configuration management hassles. More than likely, you will also have to cope with multiple versions of the native methods, one for each platform. This is particularly true when you are dealing with operating system features. (I know, C is supposed to be a portable language, but isn't that why you are using Java?)
<LI>Is it acceptable to mix object-oriented and procedural code? Keep in mind that the native methods will be written in an object-oriented style of C. You will be working with regular C structures instead of classes. These structures do not provide full information hiding. (No <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">protected</FONT></TT> or <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">private</FONT></TT> specifiers.) Ultimately, you will be working in C, with no encapsulation, no inheritance, and no polymorphism. It will require great discipline to maintain good object semantics in C. Most native methods are self-contained, so these should not be serious limitations, but you should be aware of the difficulties ahead.
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to all of these questions, then feel free to proceed. If any of the questions trouble you, then you should probably think twice before implementing that class with native methods. The Java packages contain hundreds of classes, and the method you are looking for just might be there already, buried within an obscure class.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="AnOverviewofNativeMethods"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>An
Overview of Native Methods</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
All functions in Java are object methods. Even the declaration
part of your native methods must be contained within a class.
Therefore, the first step to creating native methods is to define
one or more class interfaces. If you are dealing with a large
number of functions, it will be useful for you to partition them
into logical, coherent groups. These should form the nucleus of
each class. There are basically two approaches for defining a
class interface that will wrap the native methods. Suppose you
are dealing with native methods to provide file access. Assume
that your target platform's standard runtime library supports
multithreading. If it does not, you will have to serialize access
to all RTL functions.
<P>
One approach we could take is to create a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>
class that contains a mixture of native and Java methods that
implement an abstraction of a disk file. (This is the approach
used most often by the Java development team.) As an alternative
design, we could create two classes: a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>
class that presents an abstract view of files, and a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FileImp</FONT></TT>
class that contains all of the native methods relevant to files.
The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT> class would then
contain a reference to a single global instance of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FileImp</FONT></TT>.
See Figure 19.1.

For concrete details on how the Java development team designed this solution, look in the JDK source code. The source code is available from JavaSoft at <TT><A TARGET="resource window" HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2">http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2</A></TT>. Check out the file <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">src/java/io/File.java</FONT></TT>. The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT> class is an excellent example of integrating native methods with Java methods.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Ultimately, both techniques result in a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>
class that presents a clean abstraction of a file. The first approach
(the single-class approach) has a significant drawback in terms
of maintainability, however. Whenever the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>
class changes, the dynamically loadable library must be rebuilt.
In fact, you would need to regenerate the C header and C stub
files and recompile the library for every interface change in
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>.
<P>
With the second approach (the split interface), <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FileImp</FONT></TT>
is insulated from changes to <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>.
Likewise, changes to <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FileImp</FONT></TT>
do not affect <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>. The methods
of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FileImp</FONT></TT> do not need to
be a direct mapping from the target API. You can give them abstract
names and easily define an interface, which will rarely (if ever)
need to change. For example, the POSIX API defines two sets of
file-manipulation functions. Roughly, the sets correspond to those
which use handles returned by <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">open</FONT></TT>,
and those which use a structure pointer returned by <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">fopen</FONT></TT>.
The Win32 API defines a group of file-manipulation functions that
use a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Handle</FONT></TT> returned by
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">CreateFile</FONT></TT>. Your <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FileImp</FONT></TT>
class would define a single method called <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Open</FONT></TT>
as illustrated by Listing 19.1. Now any client of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">File</FONT></TT>
can call <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Open</FONT></TT> without regard
to the underlying system-level API.

After you have designed your class interfaces, you will need to
create the Java classes. These will be identical to any other
Java class, except for the use of the keyword <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">native</FONT></TT>.
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Native</FONT></TT> signals to javac that
this method body will be provided by a library loaded at runtime.
Therefore, you do not provide a method body for a native method.
The method declaration looks the same as if you were declaring
an abstract method. This is no coincidence. In both cases, you
are telling javac that you want to defer the definition of this
method until later. With an abstract method, you are saying that
&quot;later&quot; means a subclass. With a native method, &quot;later&quot;
means runtime loadable C code.<BR>
<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDERCOLOR=#000000 BORDER=1 WIDTH=80%>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can put &quot;<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">native</FONT></TT>&quot; on almost any method declaration. How does javac interpret an abstract, native method? Not very well. You can provide a method body for an abstract native method in C, but it will never be called. A static native method behaves just as you would expect. Its semantics are the same as they would be in a static method defined in Java. A static native method is always passed a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT> for its <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">this</FONT></TT> argument.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Native methods that are overridden in a subclass work normally. In fact, you can mix native and Java methods arbitrarily when subclassing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

After creating and compiling your Java classes, you will use javah
to create two C files: a header file and a stub file. (<A HREF="ch14.htm" >See Chapter 14</A>,
&quot;Using javah&quot; for usage information for javah.) The
header file contains a structure definition and function declarations
(prototypes) for the native methods. The stub file contains some
&quot;glue&quot; code, which you should never need to change.
Because both files created by javah are generated automatically,
you should never change either of them. javah maps the instance
variables and methods of the class directly into the C files.
So, if you ever change the Java class, you must regenerate the
C files. If you do not, strange and unpredictable behavior will
result. For example, javah created the header in Listing 19.3
from the class in Listing 19.2.

<HR>
<P>
Now suppose that you add a new integer member, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NumberOfShares</FONT></TT>,
to the Java class, right after the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">TickerSymbol</FONT></TT>.
If you do not recreate the header file, your C code will be using
the old structure layout. Therefore, your C code would access
every member from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">LastQuote</FONT></TT>.
Your C code would use the offset for <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NumberOfShares</FONT></TT>
(an integer) as if it were <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">LastQuote</FONT></TT>
(a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">float</FONT></TT>)! This mismatch
can cause some of the most irreproducible and hard-to-find bugs.
A similar problem can arise with the methods. In that case, you
are even more likely to have problems, because any change in a
method's signature means that you have to regenerate the stub
and header files.
<P>
One good way to avoid this problem is to make sure that you rarely
need to change your classes after you write them. Good design
will help there, but changes are inevitable. Creating a makefile
is the best way to ensure that you always use the most up-to-date
header and stub files. Some version of &quot;make&quot; is available
for every platform supported by the JDK. Later in this chapter,
you will find sample makefiles for Java classes with native methods.
<P>
Javah creates two files for you, but it leaves the most important
file up to you. Along with the header and stub files, you will
need to write an implementation file. The implementation file
must contain the definitions of the functions that the header
file declares. All of the really interesting things happen in
the implementation file. Figure 19.2 depicts the relationships
among the four files-the Java source, the C header, the C stubs,
and the C implementation files.
<P>
<A HREF="f19-2.gif" ><B>Figure 19.2:</B> <I>The relationship between the Java class file and the three C files.</I></A><I>.</I>
<P>
At this point, a simple example will illustrate the interaction
between the Java class and the three C files.
<H2><A NAME="WhoAmIAJavaClasstoIdentifytheU"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Who
Am I? A Java Class to Identify the User</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
To demonstrate the entire process, from the Java class all the
way to the implementation file, we will develop a class that can
return the current user's name as a string. This example will

There is already a mechanism in Java to do this. (See the documentation for the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">java.lang.System</FONT></TT> class.) Normally, you should not create a native method to accomplish something already available in the base packages. Because this is a simple demonstration, we will conveniently disregard the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">System.getProperty</FONT></TT> method.

What do we really want to know? For now, we just want to know
the user's login name. Various platforms have different API calls
to get this information. Good design dictates that we should have
a method name that is descriptive of <I>what</I> we want to know,
not <I>how</I> we learn it. So, let's just call this method <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Username</FONT></TT>.
It will return a Java string.
<P>
Remember that there are no global functions in Java. Even though
we really only need one function, we have to put it in a class.
At first, this might seem like a lot of trouble. After all, who
wants to define a complete class just to get one method? But think
about the future. Will this class always have just one method?
Odds are that, like everything else, the requirements for this
class will evolve over time. Perhaps there are other details about
users that would be of interest to your application (or even a
future application). The extra few minutes spent here in creating
a class give you a framework in which to build additional functionality
later.

Here is a line-by-line description of the code:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Line 1:</B> This line defines the class <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation</FONT></TT>.
There is nothing fancy about this class; it inherits directly
from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">java.lang.Object</FONT></TT>. Although
this class does not show it, it is usually a good idea to make
native methods-sometimes entire classes-&quot;final.&quot; Otherwise,
anyone can inherit from your native methods and possibly subvert
their behavior.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Line 2:</B> This line defines a static block of code. Static
blocks are executed when the <I>class itself </I>is loaded. You
can think of a static block as a constructor for the class as
a whole.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Line 3:</B> When this class is loaded, direct the runtime system
to load the dynamically loadable library <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation</FONT></TT>.
Exactly how the library is located and loaded varies by target
platform. See the appropriate &quot;Configuring Your Environment&quot;
section for your platform later in this chapter.

Notice the structure definition on lines 7 through 9. Because
we did not define any members of the Java class, javah created
this dummy structure. This will keep C compilers happy, but you
should not attempt to use <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">PAD</FONT></TT>
to store information. The Java specification makes no guarantees
about the contents of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">PAD</FONT></TT>.
For our purposes, the only line of real interest is line 16, where
the declaration for <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Username</FONT></TT>
appears. This is the function that our implementation file must
define. Notice that instead of taking a pointer to a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassUserInformation</FONT></TT>
structure, the C function gets a pointer to an <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HUserInformation</FONT></TT>
structure. See the sidebar &quot;Where Did <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HUserInformation</FONT></TT>
Come From?&quot; for details on this structure.<BR>

The structure <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HUserInformation</FONT></TT>, which is passed to each of the C functions, is declared as a result of the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HandleTo()</FONT></TT> macro, which is defined in <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">\java\include\oobj.h</FONT></TT> as this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">#define HandleTo(T) typedef struct H##T { Class##T *obj; \</FONT></TT>

<CENTER><TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct methodtable *methods;} H##T</FONT></TT></CENTER>

So, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HandleTo(UserInformation);</FONT></TT> expands to<BR>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">typedef struct HUserInformation {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ClassUserInformation *obj;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;struct methodtable *methods;<BR>
} HUserInformation;</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This structure provides the bookkeeping that will allow C functions to behave like class methods. To access an instance variable from your native method, follow the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">obj</FONT></TT> pointer to the instance variable structure declared by the header file. For example, if the Java class <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation</FONT></TT> had a member variable <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserID</FONT></TT>, its native methods could reference that member as <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">hUserInformation-&gt;obj-&gt;UserID</FONT></TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">methods</FONT></TT> pointer also allows your native method to get information about, and even invoke, the other methods of your class.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This structure is intended to be opaque to native methods. Because it may change in the future, the include file <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">interpreter.h</FONT></TT> provides macros to hide the details of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HUserInformation</FONT></TT>. In your native methods, you would use <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">unhand(hUserInformation)</FONT></TT> to get access to the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassUserInformation</FONT></TT> pointer. By using the macros, you insulate your code from future changes to Java internals. See &quot;Using Java Objects from Native Methods&quot; later in this chapter for details.

Once you compile your native methods into a dynamically loadable
library, you can create a simple class to exercise this native
method from an application. When you are testing an application
that uses native methods, the command-line Java interpreter &quot;java&quot;
can be a tremendous help. In this case, the class <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">main</FONT></TT>
simply creates an instance of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation</FONT></TT>
and prints the results of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Username()</FONT></TT>.

Because native language methods are so closely tied to a particular
platform, the difference in procedures is more pronounced than
with the JDK itself. For example, the compilers for different
platforms have wildly different command-line arguments. Because
of the possible variations and permutations, this section cannot
present an exhaustive reference on the native compilers. Therefore,
you should always consider the appropriate compiler reference
as the ultimate authority. The procedures in these sections worked
at the time this was written, using JDK 1.0.2 on the following
platforms: SPARC Solaris 2.5, <I>x</I>86 Solaris 2.5, Microsoft
Windows 95, Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, and Microsoft Windows NT
4.0 Beta. The Solaris platforms use the usual &quot;cc&quot; compiler.
The Windows platforms have been tested using Visual C++ 2.0 and
4.0.

If you get this exception by itself, without a larger walkback
above it, then your library is missing the function being called
by this native method.
<P>
As you can see, when you are using native methods, most of the
problems show up when the runtime attempts to load the library.
Unfortunately, there is no simple solution. This is basically
an installation and configuration management problem. Worse yet,
there is no way for one class to catch exceptions that occur when
the JVM is loading another class.
<H2><A NAME="TheMethodandtheFunction"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>The
Method and the Function</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
There are two parts to every native method: the Java declaration
and the native language definition. The Java Virtual Machine provides
enough capabilities that the native language component can do
virtually everything that a typical Java method can. This section
will examine the two sides of a native method: the Java declaration
and the native language definition. The next few sections will
examine how the native language component works with the JVM to
make all of this work.
<P>
Starting with the Java declaration, consider the method signature
from the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation</FONT></TT>
example earlier in the chapter.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">public native String Username();</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It looks more or less the same as any other method. The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">native</FONT></TT>
keyword means that the method body is not needed. (In fact, it
is not permitted.) The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">native</FONT></TT>
keyword tells the compiler that the definition (the method body)
is provided in a different language.
<P>
In this example, no arguments were needed. However, you can pass
arguments to native methods and get return values from them. These
arguments and return values can include objects. See &quot;Arguments
and Return Values&quot; for specifics.
<P>
We used javah to create the header file for the native side. Take
a look at the function signature created by javah.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct Hjava_lang_String *UserInformation_Username(struct
HUserInformation *);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
By examining this piece by piece, you can see how the Java to
C linkage works. First, the return type is declared as <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct
Hjava_lang_String *</FONT></TT>. In the native language, all objects
are accessed through a <I>handle</I>-a special structures that
allows access to an object's instance variables and the class's
methods (the object's vtable.) You can translate <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Hjava_lang_String</FONT></TT>
directly to &quot;<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">java.lang.String</FONT></TT>&quot;.
Handles are always passed as pointers for efficiency.
<P>
As you can see, the function name itself is comprised of the class
name, an underscore, and the method name itself. If you wanted
to add a new native method to find out the user's disk quota,
it would be named something like <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation_DiskQuota</FONT></TT>.
Because javah can generate all of the function declarations, there
is rarely a need to create these names, but because the names
are not &quot;mangled&quot; (the way early C++ to C translators
did), the resulting code is very readable.
<P>
The final item in this signature is the argument <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct
HUserInformation *</FONT></TT>. It is an <I>automatic parameter</I>,
which will be explained in the next section.
<H2><A NAME="ArgumentsandReturnValues"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Arguments
and Return Values</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Pure Java methods can pass arguments to native methods just as
they would to any other method call. Native methods can return
any value that a Java method would. How does this work when two
such vastly different languages are involved? It works because
the Java Virtual Machine exposes some of its internals to the
native language. At the same time, the header files that support
native methods use features of the C preprocessor and compiler
to shield you, the developer, from the guts of the Java implementation.
Essentially, when you are developing a native method, you are
hooking right into the most fundamental aspects of Java's implementation.
As a result, you must be careful to follow the rules, or you risk
writing fragile code and upsetting the JVM itself.
<P>
Simple data types map directly from Java to C. Some difficulties
arise because arrays are first class objects in Java, whereas
they are aggregate data types in C. Arrays appear in C code as
Java objects. Table 19.1 shows the data type mapping from Java
to C.<BR>

<P>
The most important argument for any native method is the first
parameter passed to all native methods. It is referred to as an
automatic parameter. Look back at the example earlier in this
chapter. The function <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation_Username</FONT></TT>
was passed a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct HUserInformation
*</FONT></TT> as the first (and only) argument. This pointer serves
the same function as the implicit <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">this</FONT></TT>
pointer in C++. That is, the first parameter passed to a native
method points to the object instance for which that method is
being called. You can use this pointer to access the instance
variables of the class. With it, you can even call other methods
of the object. This automatic parameter takes the form of a <I>handle</I>.
(See the sidebar &quot;What are Handles, Anyway?&quot;.)
<P>
The confluence of handles, multithreading, and garbage collection
leads to some interesting consequences for your C code. First
of all, your C code <I>must</I> be fully re-entrant. Because a
Java application can have an arbitrary number of threads, any
one of those threads can call your native method-even if another
thread is already executing in that method, unless you synchronize
the method. See &quot;Multithreading and Native Methods.&quot;
Also, remember that the garbage collection runs in an idle thread,
but another thread may request that the garbage collector run
immediately.
<P>
How does this affect your native methods? The garbage collector
may relocate objects in memory! As long as you maintain a reference
to your arguments, particularly your <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">this</FONT></TT>
pointer, it will not be relocated. However, if you try to store
the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">obj</FONT></TT> pointer from the
object handle (for example, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">hUserInformation-&gt;obj</FONT></TT>)
in a global variable, two very bad things will happen. First,
the garbage collector may relocate or <I>even destroy </I>the
object. This is because each object has a reference count-a count
of the outstanding handles to that object. When the object's reference
count hits zero, it is put into a pool that can be garbage collected
at any time. When your method returned, the handle passed to it
went out of scope and the object's reference count was decremented.
Although you still have a copy of the handle, the object may get
destroyed without warning. For instance, another thread may cause
the reference count to hit zero, ven though your variable still
has a pointer. Then your variable points to deallocated memory.
The second problem with this scenario comes from the multithreading
itself. Any function that uses global data is suspect in a multithreaded
program. It is very difficult to prove that a function using global
data will behave correctly when faced with re-entrant calls. Here
again, the most likely consequence is an invalid pointer. The
JVM is well protected, but it can still be crashed. Never believe
anyone who tells you that it is impossible to get a core dump
or GPF from Java! Anytime native methods are involved, the JVM
is only as robust as those native methods.
<P>
In Table 19.1, all of the Java array types appear as handles in
the object instances. Java treats arrays as first-class types
and implements them as objects. When passing an array to a native
method, the JVM translates it into a C-like array. However, the
array instance variables are still (Java) arrays when accessed
from C. Therefore, the C code must treat it as an object.
<P>
Returning primitive and complex data types works exactly the same
way as primitive and complex arguments. Sometimes, as in the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">UserInformation</FONT></TT>
example, this may involve constructing new Java objects in C code.
The next section explains how to accomplish this feat.
<H2><A NAME="UsingJavaObjectsfromNativeMethods"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Using
Java Objects from Native Methods</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
In native methods, all objects appear as handles. Handles are
at the heart of the Java object model, but you will be shielded
from directly manipulating handles. A group of C macros and functions
permit you to deal with handles largely as an abstract type. So
what can you do with a handle?
<H3><A NAME="AcessingInstanceVariablesfromNative">Accessing Instance
Variables from Native Methods</A></H3>
<P>
For starters, you can access all of an object's instance variables-all
those that are visible to your code, at least. In order for your
native method to access the data members of your object, you dereference
the handle with the macro <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">unhand()</FONT></TT>.
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Unhand()</FONT></TT> is defined in the
header file <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">interpreter.h</FONT></TT>,
which is included by <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">StubPreamble.h</FONT></TT>.

variables from a native method.

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD WIDTH=590>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the Java implementation, a handle is used to maintain references to objects. Handles allow the use of native languages to truly be &quot;two-way.&quot; That is, the native methods can access instance variables and call other methods, just as pure Java methods can. Handles are at the very heart of the Java object model. In code, a handle is a small structure with two pointers, which together form an object instance. One points to the instance variables, the other to the method table (the vtable in C++ parlance). Handles for your classes are created automatically when you create the header file. (See the sidebar &quot;Where Did <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HUserInformation</FONT></TT> Come From?&quot;)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By using pointers to handles to pass objects around, Java attains great efficiency. Because object manipulations work through handles, there is a single item of interest to the garbage collector, and a natural mechanism for marking objects in use or discarded.</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">unhand()</FONT></TT> macro returns
a pointer to an ordinary C structure. (For handles to objects
of your class, it returns a pointer to the structure defined in
your header file.) In all cases, the members of the C structure
have the same names as the members of the Java class. The types
may be different, however. Check Table 19.1 for the type mapping.
You can read and write to the members of the structure. In fact,
you can even pass pointers to them as arguments to other functions.
They behave in all ways as members of ordinary C structures, because
that is exactly what they are. When you use <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">unhand()</FONT></TT>
on a handle, you are actually looking at the fundamental Java
implementation of an object. The structures you see using the
handle are the real structures; there is no behind-the-scenes
marshalling before the call.
<H3><A NAME="AccessingClassVariablesfromNativeMe">Accessing Class
Variables from Native Methods</A></H3>
<P>
Class variables (static variables) do not appear in the instance
variable structure generated by javah. This is because they are
not stored with each instance of a class, but rather with the
class structure itself. The Java runtime provides a function that
you can use to get a pointer to the class variable <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">getclassvariable</FONT></TT>.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">long *getclassvariable(struct ClassClass
*cb, char *fname);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Notice that this function, like many other Java runtime functions,
requires a pointer to the class structure. Fortunately, every
object instance carries this pointer around. The <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">obj_classblock</FONT></TT>
macro from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">interpreter.h</FONT></TT>
takes an object handle as an argument and returns a pointer to
the class structure.
<P>
Why does <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">getclassvariable</FONT></TT>
return a pointer to a long? It returns a pointer because the native
language code should be able to modify the class variables, as
well as see them. The return type is long, but in C, all pointers
to data are the same size. So, it is safe to cast the returned
pointer to a pointer to whatever type the class variable really
is.
<P>
Be warned that unless your native methods are synchronized, modifying
class variables can be problematic. Always remember that, even
though this method is in C, it really is being called from a multithreaded
environment. There may be other threads executing Java methods
or native methods. They may be doing any number of things, including
accessing the class variable at exactly the same time as the native
method. Any time global data is involved, whether it is class-wide
or truly global, synchronization is an issue. See &quot;Multithreading
and Native Methods&quot; for more details.
<P>
Wouldn't it be nice if your native language code could also call
Java code? Yes, it really would. Fortunately, we can do exactly
that. It all starts with the object handle. (Where else?) You
have to use a slightly more complicated mechanism than you might
think at first. Calling another C function from a function pointer
in a structure is something familiar to all of us, something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">hUserInformation-&gt;Username();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// DO NOT DO THIS!</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Although this would have the net effect of transferring execution
to the other function, it is not sufficient. Here's why: When
calling a C function, a stack frame is created with the return
address and some arguments. (Implementations vary somewhat; this
is necessarily a very general description.) In Java, there is
much more <I>context</I> provided for a function call. In addition
to the processor stack, the JVM maintains a great deal of stack
information on its own, internal stack. (Presumably, combining
this stack with the processor stack, both in hardware, is one
of the benefits of a &quot;Java chip.&quot;)
<P>
In order to make the method call, we really have to ask the JVM
to do the call for us. Here are the three functions declared in
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">interpreter.h</FONT></TT> that will make
these calls:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HObject *execute_java_constructor(ExecEnv
*, char *classname,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClassClass *cb, char *signature, ...);<BR>
long execute_java_dynamic_method(ExecEnv *, HObject *obj,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *method_name, char *signature, ...);<BR>
long execute_java_static_method(ExecEnv *, ClassClass *cb,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *method_name, char *signature, ...);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Each function serves a specific purpose and is described separately
in the following section.
<H3><A NAME="CallingaJavaConstructor">Calling a Java Constructor</A>
</H3>
<P>
Native language code can construct an instance of any Java class
that is currently loaded. Here again, the native code is hooking
directly into the implementation of Java. Therefore, the new object
will behave exactly as it would if you had constructed it in Java
code. The general form of a native language constructor is this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">hNewObject = (HClassName *)execute_java_constructor(NULL,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ClassName&quot;, NULL, &quot;ConstructorSignature&quot;,
...);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first parameter here is the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ExecEnv</FONT></TT>
or exception environment that applies to the constructor call.
You can safely pass a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT>
here, and the constructor will operate with the default exception
environment. If you are using sophisticated exception handling
in your native code, please see the section &quot;Native Methods
and Exceptions.&quot;
<P>
The interesting pieces of this call are shown in italics. First
of all, in order for the native method to use the object that
gets constructed, it must know the object's class. Usually, this
comes from including a header file for that class. Only a few
classes have headers distributed with the JDK: <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassLoader</FONT></TT>,
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">String</FONT></TT>, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Thread</FONT></TT>,
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ThreadGroup</FONT></TT>. However,
by using javah, you can create header files for whatever classes
you need. (<A HREF="ch14.htm" >See Chapter 14</A> for details.)
If you do not need to access the object's methods or instance
variables, you can cast the return value from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_constructor</FONT></TT>
to an <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HObject</FONT></TT> pointer. <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">HObject</FONT></TT>
is the handle to the base class <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Object</FONT></TT>.

If you need to load a class directly from native code, you can call the function:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">int LoadFile(char *<I>filename</I>, char *<I>directory</I>, char *<I>SourceHint</I>);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

It is safe to pass <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT> for <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SourceHint</FONT></TT>.

The next item of interest in this call is the class name. This
is a text string that specifies what class is to be instantiated.
This class must already be loaded, or reside on the class path.
When you pass a class name, the Java runtime must perform a lookup
on the class itself. However, if you have a pointer to the class
itself, you can leave the class name argument <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT>
and pass the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassClass</FONT></TT> pointer
in the third argument. For example, if you wanted to clone an
existing object of any class, you might use code like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct HObject *Cloner_Clone(struct HCloner
*hCloner,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return hNewInst;<BR>
}</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This native method can clone any object that has a copy constructor.
The macro <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">obj_classblock</FONT></TT>
is another of the handle convenience macros. For any object, it
will return a pointer to the class structure for that object.
Many of the built-in functions of the Java runtime require a pointer
to the class structure &quot;<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassClass</FONT></TT>&quot;.

By concatenating characters from this set, you specify what arguments
are to follow. Two characters have special significance: the parentheses
indicate the beginning and end of the argument list. For a constructor,
parentheses should enclose the entire argument list. For other
methods, the signature will also indicate the return type of the
method. In the preceding example, the signature is &quot;(A)&quot;,
which means the constructor must simply take one argument-an object
instance. This implies that our constructor could receive objects
of other classes as arguments. If we knew the class name, say
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Foo</FONT></TT>, for example, we could
write the signature as &quot;<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">(LFoo;)</FONT></TT>&quot;,
which means the constructor must take an instance of class <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Foo</FONT></TT>
<I>or its subclasses</I>, as an argument. Here is a revised version
of the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Clone</FONT></TT> method, which
takes into account the class name of the argument passed in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">struct HObject *Cloner_Clone(struct HCloner
*hCloner,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
struct HObject *hObj)<BR>
{<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HObject *hNewInst;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signature[80];
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprintf(signature, &quot;(L%s;)&quot;, classname(obj_classblock(hObj)));
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hNewInst = execute_java_constructor(NULL, NULL,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
obj_classblock(hObject), signature, hObj);<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return hNewInst;<BR>
}</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Notice that, although &quot;<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">name</FONT></TT>&quot;
is a simple member of struct <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassClass</FONT></TT>,
we use the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">classname</FONT></TT> macro
(from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">oobj.h</FONT></TT>) instead of
a direct access. In general, you should never access a structure
member directly. Instead, use one of the macros provided in <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">oobj.h</FONT></TT>
or <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">interpreter.h</FONT></TT> (both included
by <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">StubPreamble.h</FONT></TT>). The macros
shield you from future changes to the structures. What if there
is no macro to access a particular member? Then you probably are
not meant to use that member in the first place!
<P>
After the constructor signature, you can place a variable length
argument list. These are the arguments that will be passed to
your constructor. You should be careful to make sure that the
type, number, and order of your arguments match the signature.
Otherwise, your constructor may be called with garbage for arguments.
<P>
If there is an error while calling the constructor, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_constructor</FONT></TT>
will return <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT>.
<H3><A NAME="CallingaJavaMethod">Calling a Java Method</A></H3>
<P>
Now for the really good part. You can call any Java method from
native code. It all works through the handle to the object instance.
If the method to be called is static, see the next section. For
dynamic methods-including final and native methods-use the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_dynamic_method</FONT></TT>
function:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">long execute_java_dynamic_method(ExecEnv
*, HObject *obj,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *method_name, char *signature, ...);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first parameter is the same as the first argument to <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_</FONT></TT>constructor-an
exception environment. Again, it is safe to pass a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT>
for this parameter. If you require more sophisticated exception
handling for the native code, see &quot;Native Methods and Exceptions.&quot;
<P>
The second parameter is the object instance itself. This can be
any valid object handle, whether it was passed from Java code
as an argument or constructed in the native method itself.
<P>
The next parameter is the name of the method to be invoked. If
this method does not exist in the object passed, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_dynamic_method</FONT></TT>
will throw an exception.
<P>
Finally, the fourth argument is the signature of the instance
method. Again, the signature indicates the type and number of
arguments to be passed to the instance method being called. This
must be the same number and type of remaining arguments in the
call to <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_dynamic_method</FONT></TT>.
<P>
The signature for a method differs slightly from the signature
for a constructor. A method signature needs to indicate the expected
return type. The signature can show this with an extra character
after the closing parenthesis. For example, consider a method
that takes arguments of two classes and a float and returns a
byte:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">public byte[] FunkyMethod(Object fc,
SecondClass sc,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float
difference);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This method would have the signature &quot;<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">(ALSecondClass;F)B</FONT></TT>&quot;.
The call to <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_dynamic_method</FONT></TT>
would then have three arguments after the signature: a generic
object, an instance of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SecondClass</FONT></TT>,
and a float.
<P>
The return value from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_dynamic_method</FONT></TT>
depends on the method being invoked. It is declared as <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">long</FONT></TT>,
however, so you will need to cast it to the appropriate type.
(Because <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">long</FONT></TT> is wide enough
to hold any primitive type or a handle, it is safe to cast it
to whatever the method really returns.) Be careful, though. Because
you are calling the method by a function, not directly, the compiler
cannot possibly notify you of any changes in the method definition.
<H3><A NAME="CallingaStaticJavaMethod">Calling a Static Java Method</A>
</H3>
<P>
Calling a class method from native code is similar to calling
a dynamic method. Use the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_static_method</FONT></TT>
function:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">long execute_java_static_method(ExecEnv
*, ClassClass *cb,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char *method_name, char *signature, ...);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is entirely analogous to the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_dynamic_method</FONT></TT>
function, with one crucial difference. Instead of taking an object
instance as a parameter, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">execute_java_static_method</FONT></TT>
requires a class structure. This class structure can come from
an object instance, using the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">obj_classblock</FONT></TT>
macro, or it can be retrieved using the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FindClass</FONT></TT>
function:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">ClassClass* FindClass(ExecEnv *ee, char
*classname, bool_t resolve);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FindClass</FONT></TT> will return a pointer
to the class structure for any class name you pass in. This function
may cause several things to happen. First, the named class may
be loaded, which will in turn cause the named class's static block
to execute. Exceptions may be thrown by <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FindClass</FONT></TT>
itself, if it cannot find the class, or by the static block of
the named class, when it is loaded.
<P>
Like the other runtime functions that can throw exceptions, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FindClass</FONT></TT>
can take an exception environment as an argument. As usual, it
is safe to pass a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT> here,
in which case <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">FindClass</FONT></TT> will
use the current exception environment.
<H2><A NAME="MultithreadingandNativeMethods"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Multithreading
and Native Methods</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
Even though the native methods are written in C, they still execute
within the context of the Java environment, including multithreading.
Native methods will sometimes have sections of code that modify
global (class or application) data, which modify important state
variables, or which must call non-re-entrant functions. (Some
platform-specific APIs fall into this category.) These sections
are called <I>critical sections</I>, because it is critical that
no more than one thread executes the section of code at a time.
Critical sections are not unique to native methods: the same issues
exist when dealing with multithreading in pure Java code.
<P>
In order to ensure that the native methods maintain the application
in a consistent state, these native methods will have to be synchronized
with other threads. The simplest way to accomplish this is to
declare the native methods as synchronized in the Java code. Sometimes,
however, this will be insufficient, either for performance reasons
(for example, a method that does a long computation, but only
changes the condition variable infrequently), or because a multithreaded
application needs to use an existing object that does not have
synchronized methods (most do not).
<P>
In these cases, your native code can perform the synchronization
directly. In Java code, you could put the critical section inside
a synchronized block. The native method analogue to a synchronized
block directly uses a <I>monitor</I>.
<P>
Monitors prevent two threads from simultaneously executing a section
of code. Monitors were first introduced in C.A.R. Hoare's seminal
paper &quot;Communicating Sequential Processes&quot; (<I>Communications
of the ACM</I>, Vol. 21, No. 8, August 1978). Typically, each
condition variable has a monitor associated with it. The monitor
acts as a lock on that data. Unless a thread holds the monitor,
it cannot modify <I>or inspect</I> that data. Obviously, a thread
should hold the monitor as briefly as possible.<BR>

In Java, critical sections are usually methods. You can synchronize blocks of code smaller than methods. However, this leads to complex code, with many failure modes. Deadlock prevention at the method level is fairly straightforward, but it becomes rapidly more difficult when dealing with many small blocks of synchronized code.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Monitors provide the Java runtime system support for thread synchronization.
Every object instance has a unique monitor attached to it. In
this case, the entire object is considered a condition variable.
Through a trio of functions, native methods can also use monitors.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Monitors are re-entrant, which means that a thread that already holds a monitor will not deadlock if it calls <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">monitorWait</FONT></TT> again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Monitor operations are atomic. They are not subject to race conditions (although the code that calls them is).</BLOCKQUOTE>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
The Java implementation of monitors has a nice feature that helps
to prevent deadlock. Consider this scenario: a synchronized native
method calls <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">monitorWait</FONT></TT>,
to wait for another synchronized method (native or not) to notify
the monitor. Because the first method is synchronized, it already
holds the monitor when <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">monitorWait</FONT></TT>
is called. How is the second method ever supposed to execute?
The implementation of <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">monitorWait</FONT></TT>
makes this possible by releasing the monitor on entry. This allows
the second method to execute and notify the monitor. Once the
monitor is notified, the first thread awakens. On exit from <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">monitorWait</FONT></TT>,
the first thread acquires the monitor again.
<P>
All three of the monitor functions are declared as receiving an
unsigned integer. To get the monitor for an object, use the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">obj_monitor</FONT></TT>
macro on the object's handle.
<P>
Here is an example of a synchronized string. This is an example
of a producer/consumer problem. (Most synchronization problems
can be reduced to one of two classic examples, producer/consumer
and the colorfully named &quot;dining philosophers problem.&quot;
The dining philosophers problem is discussed in <A HREF="ch20.htm" >Chapter 20</A>,
&quot;Working with Threads.&quot;) In a producer/consumer problem,
one thread produces data items while another consumes them. Both
operations must be synchronized so that the consumer gets each
item exactly once. Listing 19.9 contains the Java definition of
the synchronized string class, <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SyncString</FONT></TT>.
Listing 19.10 shows the native method implementations of the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SyncString.Set</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SyncString.Get</FONT></TT> methods.
Note once again that this could easily have been accomplished
without the use of native methods. You will find that native methods
are only useful in a very small set of circumstances.

Native methods can throw exceptions just like a regular Java method.
As with any other method that throws an exception, the native
method in the Java class must declare the exceptions that it can
throw. This looks exactly like the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">throws</FONT></TT>
clause for any other method.
<P>
Your native code throws the actual exception using the <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">SignalError</FONT></TT>
function:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">void SignalError(ExecEnv *ee, char *Exception,
char *SourceHint);</FONT></TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first argument is the exception environment to use for the
exception. Generally, you will pass a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT>
here to indicate the current environment.
<P>
The second argument is the fully specified exception name. This
name includes the package in which the exception is defined. It
should also be specified as a path, replacing the usual period
separators with forward slashes (that is, UNIX-style path separators).
<P>
The third argument is a source code hint. You can pass a string
that describes the error or provides some useful details. This
string will appear on the walkback if the exception is not handled.
It is safe to pass a <TT><FONT FACE="Courier">NULL</FONT></TT>
here.
<H2><A NAME="UsingJavaStringsfromNativeMethods"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>Using

Because there is an &quot;impedance mismatch&quot; between Java
strings and C strings, there are several convenience functions
that allow C code to use the Java strings. Java strings offer
several advantages over C strings, including reference counting,
automatic memory management, and Unicode support. On the other
hand, no C runtime library function or API function will expect
a Java string. The utility functions provide a bridge between
Java and C strings.

the buffer passed in the first argument:<BR>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Hjava_lang_String *makeJavaString(char

<LI>The following interesting function allocates some temporary
memory for a C string initialized from the given Java string.

this pointer in a variable, the memory is valid:<BR>
<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">char *makeCString(Hjava_lang_String *)</FONT></TT>

<LI>The following function will convert the characters of the

<LI>The following function will convert the characters of the

<P>
Native methods provide a powerful means of extending the capabilities
of the Java runtime environment. Although native methods are inherently
platform-specific, there are certain cases where they might be
used. By tapping directly into the implementation of the Java
object model, the native language functions can access instance
and class variables, construct objects, and call static and dynamic
methods. Native methods can be synchronized like ordinary Java
methods. They can also throw exceptions. To bridge the gap between
Java strings and C strings, the Java runtime environment provides
a number of utility functions.
<P>
The steps to constructing native methods are as follows:
<OL>
<LI>Define the class interface.
<LI>Write the Java classes.
<LI>Compile the Java classes.
<LI>Use javah to create the header and stub files.
<LI>Write the implementation file.
<LI>Compile the C files into a dynamically loadable library.
<LI>Install the dynamically loadable library on the target platform.
